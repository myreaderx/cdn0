The global COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement have put conversations about systemic inequity and racial injustice front and center. As we work to understand what the path forward will look like, we have the opportunity to create a better world—but only if we can face our history around these issues head-on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we are releasing our first DEI report to share our numbers and continue the important dialogue around these topics in the tech industry. Our report outlines where we’ve made progress, where we need to improve and which commitments we’re making to cultivate an equitable workplace for current and future team members. As we continue to invest in advancing our efforts, our team’s commitment to championing DEI has never been stronger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to navigating through the challenges this year has presented, our team has dedicated many hours to serving our communities and taking action against social and racial injustice. As our CEO, Justyn Howard, recently said, “This has long been a focus and priority for Sprout, but like all aspects of this company, we measure ourselves by the work left undone. There’s more to do, and we will.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We look forward to what’s ahead for Sprout, our team and our communities.

You’re just misusing it.","link":"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/?p=142822/","description":"<p>It’s been <a href=\"https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2018/02/history-hashtags-symbol-changed-way-search-share/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13 years</a> since the founding of the hashtag and marketers are now questioning if hashtags are still relevant. Some find value in using them to organize their content while others are asking why do people still use hashtags in the first place. When we asked our community on our Instagram how they felt about hashtags, 66% said they’re a key part of their social strategies but 34% said they’re “over them.”</p>\n<p>Part of the problem with hashtags is marketers can’t control how people use them. It’s common practice for people to hijack hashtags and exploit a brand’s marketing strategy for personal gain on platforms like Twitter or TikTok. <a href=\"https://www.glossy.co/beauty/how-tiktok-hashtag-hijacking-is-impacting-beauty-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eos</a>, for example, created the hashtag #MakeItAwesome to highlight how its products were made, but TikTok users have since adopted it to tag completely unrelated videos.</p>\n<p>There’s also confusion over the purpose of a hashtag in marketing. In the latest <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sprout Social Index</a>, only 25% of consumers say they use hashtags to find new accounts to like and follow—but as marketers we’re taught that hashtags help boost brand visibility. Add to this the debate over whether hashtags are even effective on platforms that aren’t Instagram or Twitter, and it’s no surprise some marketers are asking themselves: “is the hashtag dead?”</p>\n<h2>Hear me out&#8230;</h2>\n<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding the hashtag, it’s still an essential asset in any social marketer’s toolbox and not worth writing off just yet.</p>\n<p>When used correctly, <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/hashtag-marketing-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hashtags</a> can help marketers reach niche audiences, track campaigns and brand their social content. Realizing these benefits, though, requires greater specificity and intentionality behind which hashtags you use and when. If you’re using hashtags to reach new audiences, don’t assume hashtags will work the same on every social platform. If you’re tracking a campaign or contest, explicitly tell your audience which hashtags to include in their social post. In the following Tweet, Bud Light provides clear instructions on which hashtags people need to use to enter a sweepstakes to win a homerun ball.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bud Light is giving you a chance to take home an authentic 2020 home run ball!

When fans can catch homers from home, there’s a Bud Light there. <a href=\"https://t.co/8RFwwkqKZh\">pic.twitter.com/8RFwwkqKZh</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Bud Light Seltzer (@budlight) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/budlight/status/1286271896154255361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 23, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>The more general the hashtag is, the less valuable it will be. Instead of bandwagoning a popular trend or hashtagging #every #single #word, use keywords or phrases that are more niche to your audience. Relevance is key, but equally important is identifying hashtags that will help your brand stand out from your competitors and contribute towards your goals.</p>\n<p>Lastly, hashtags are most effective when marketers exercise restraint. If you can use a keyword as a regular word, there’s no need to throw a pound sign in front of it. Hashtags are great for rallying your community and measuring audience engagement but going overboard can do more harm than good. Choose wisely.</p>\n<p>If you’re still questioning the value of hashtags, take a moment to honestly evaluate how you’re using them as part of your strategy. What’s your intent behind which hashtags you use, and do you know how they perform across different social platforms? Focus less on finding the “right” amount of hashtags to use and try experimenting with different keywords and phrases to find your brand’s sweet spot.</p>\n<p>When you approach your <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/hashtag-analytics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hashtag strategy</a> with greater specificity and intentionality, you too can turn hashtags into a powerful tool in your social marketing arsenal.</p>\n<p><em>Agree with our take?

That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s such a powerful way to connect with your audience and build up your brand.</p>\n<p>Whether you go live on <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-live-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a>, Instagram, <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/27/youtube-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube</a>, depends on where most of your audience is. So we&#8217;ve put together this ultimate guide to Instagram Live so you have all the tools you need to create a successful live video strategy.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive in to learn all about using Instagram Live and why you should take advantage of this unique type of video marketing.</p>\n<h2>Why go live on Instagram?</h2>\n<p>Why should you even bother with this strategy? Why should you go live on Instagram?</p>\n<p>Going live on any platform can seem a bit daunting, especially since you only get one shot. There&#8217;s no going back to edit this footage – whatever happens is happening in front of a live audience.</p>\n<p>But that shouldn&#8217;t hold you back. Instagram Live can still be an awesome way to connect with your audience.</p>\n<p>First, you can easily <strong>capture a broader audience</strong> when you create an Instagram livestream. Followers who have their app open when you go live will receive a notification that you&#8217;re broadcasting.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but as you can see on the home screen below, all live videos appear at the beginning of Instagram Stories. This ensures that any of your followers who open the app will see you&#8217;re live and potentially join in to watch your livestream.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142615\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/IMG_6091-e1597417861777.png\" alt=\"instagram live - livestreams appear in the instagram stories feed\" width=\"439\" height=\"185\" /></figure>\n<p>Going live is also an excellent way to communicate with your followers in real time. Viewers are able to type questions into the comment box that you can respond to during your livestream.</p>\n<p>What other <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social media strategy</a> gives you that instant communication with your customers?</p>\n<p><strong>None</strong>, which is exactly why Instagram Live is such a unique tactic to add into your existing <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-marketing-strategy/\">Instagram marketing strategy</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s cover the basics and a few how-to&#8217;s.</p>\n<h2>How to use Instagram Live</h2>\n<p>Alright, now this is the big question – how do you go live on Instagram? It&#8217;s actually incredibly easy, which can help take a bit of the pressure off of you.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll walk you through a few different how-to&#8217;s, from going live to moderating comments and more.</p>\n<h3>How to go live on Instagram</h3>\n<p>Going live on Instagram is a really easy, two-step process.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe to open your Instagram Stories camera then tap the <strong>Live</strong> option at the bottom of the screen. You&#8217;ll see a screen like the one below, with a note at the top letting you know how many of your followers are active on the app.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142617\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/IMG_6093.png\" alt=\"instagram live - before you broadcast, you can see how many followers are actively online with the count at the top\" width=\"400\" height=\"711\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you&#8217;re ready, tap the button to start your livestream. The app will check your connection, and once you&#8217;re good to go, your livestream will begin.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142618\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/IMG_6094.png\" alt=\"instagram live - when you go live, you can comment, use filters, show images, among other features.\" width=\"400\" height=\"711\" /></figure>\n<p>While you&#8217;re streaming, you can still access a few features at the bottom of your screen.</p>\n<p>For example, you can type comments back to your audience. This is a great feature to use when one person is filming and another person is live.</p>\n<p>You can also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>type featured questions for your viewers to respond to,</li>\n<li>DM your livestream to someone,</li>\n<li>bring in another Instagram user to co-host your livestream with you,</li>\n<li>add filters onto your camera, or show a photo or slideshow of photos throughout your live video.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to moderate comments in Instagram Live</h3>\n<p>There are a few different ways that you might want to track and moderate comments throughout your live video. It&#8217;s possible to prevent comments with certain words or phrases, removing irrelevant comments and more.</p>\n<p>If you want to hide comments on Instagram Live, head over to your <strong>profile settings</strong> before you start.</p>\n<p>Under <strong>Privacy</strong>, tap <strong>Comments</strong> to access your comment controls. From here, you can choose specific people to block from commenting, toggle the option to hide offensive comments and even manually filter certain words or phrases.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142625\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/IMG_6095.png\" alt=\"instagram live - you can control or hide comments that appear on your livestream \" width=\"400\" height=\"711\" /></figure>\n<p>You can also choose to turn off commenting completely while you&#8217;re live. Just tap the three dots next to the comment box and select <strong>Turn Off Commenting</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you want to <strong>pin a comment</strong>, either from you or an audience member, you can simply tap and hold the comment to pin it. It&#8217;ll stay at the top of the comments feed for all viewers to see.</p>\n<h3>How to share your finished livestream</h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve ended your livestream, it automatically stays on your <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/brand-story-instagram-story/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram Story</a> for 24 hours. But what if you want to keep it for longer?</p>\n<p>After ending your Instagram Live video, the app gives you three options – share to IGTV, download your video or delete your video.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142632\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/IMG_6096.png\" alt=\"instagram live - when you end your video, you can share your livestream to IGTV or download it.\" width=\"400\" height=\"711\" /></figure>\n<p>Sharing your livestream to IGTV keeps it on your Instagram profile. That means followers can come back to watch it if they missed it beyond the 24-hour limit.</p>\n<p>You can also download the video and upload to other platforms like Facebook or YouTube, depending on where your audience lives.</p>\n<h2>Instagram Live best practices</h2>\n<p>To put together the best live video possible, be sure to read through these Instagram Live best practices before you get started.</p>\n<p>These tips will help ensure you&#8217;re prepared for your livestream so you&#8217;re not winging it in the moment.</p>\n<h3>Have a purpose for your livestream</h3>\n<p>What are you hoping to share? What is the objective for going live?</p>\n<p>You need to know what you want to talk about, promote, teach or share throughout your livestream well before hitting that broadcast button.</p>\n<p>Prepare, prepare, prepare so that your audience receives nothing but value from your video.</p>\n<h3>Promote your livestream in advance</h3>\n<p>Let your followers know about your livestream ahead of time rather than having an impromptu session. This will maximize the number of viewers who tune in.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s great that Instagram does its own part in notifying people to join your livestream while they&#8217;re in the app. But it&#8217;s <em>your</em> job to ensure that more people are online when it&#8217;s time to go live so they receive that notification.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-to-promote-digital-events/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Promote your livestream</a> via your Instagram Stories or with posts in your feed – whatever fits best with your content strategy. Start promoting at least a week in advance, depending on how important your livestream content is.</p>\n<p>If you add a countdown clock to your Stories, followers can select if they want to receive a reminder about your livestream added to their calendar. Use the features Instagram offers to your advantage when promoting your event!</p>\n<h3>Go live for more than 10 minutes</h3>\n<p>Marketers have found that longer livestreams tend to perform better and reach a larger audience than shorter ones.</p>\n<p>Part of this is because longer livestreams should have more content prepared. But it&#8217;s also because many people will come and go from livestreams, and the longer your video lasts, the more time people have to pop in and out.</p>\n<p>Aim for at least 10 minutes, but keep in mind that the longest you can stay on a single livestream is one hour. If you need to go longer than that, you&#8217;ll need to start a second livestream.</p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t worry if things aren&#8217;t perfect</h3>\n<p>You&#8217;re most likely livestreaming, most likely from your smartphone. Not everything is always going to work out perfectly, and your audience also doesn&#8217;t expect it to. Don&#8217;t let any hiccups ruin your entire video if you have some audio or connection issues halfway through.</p>\n<p>Run a quick apology by your audience if there are any interruptions or issues, then continue with the rest of your content.

From strategy through execution and results, we’ll examine what makes the best brands on social tick — and leave you with some key takeaways to consider for your own brand’s social strategy.</em></p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>The competition for attention is fierce for brands on social. Take a moment to consider what happens <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/what-happens-on-the-internet-every-minute-2019-version-infographic/558793/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">every 60 seconds</a> on that channel: Instagram users post 277,777 stories and 55,140 photos, YouTube users watch 4.5 million videos and Twitter users send 511, 200 tweets—per minute! And if divided attention wasn’t enough of a hurdle for brands, consumers are also more informed, more selective, less trusting and less patient than ever before. It’s no wonder <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">69%</a> of social marketers say increasing brand awareness is still their number one goal for social. How does a brand looking to make a name for itself overcome these obstacles? To help us answer that question, let’s take a deep dive into a company with arguably the greatest brand recognition in history.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, Nike takes the gold for most followed brand on Instagram clocking in at 117 million followers. When asked their opinion during our recent <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Index</a> survey, 9% of our consumer respondents wrote in Nike as the best brand to follow on social. Sure, it’s the largest and most profitable athletic footwear and apparel company in the world. But success in the market doesn’t always translate to success on social. So what’s their secret? Consumers and social marketers agree that a brand’s social media presence stands out from the competition when it’s <strong>creative</strong>, <strong>memorable</strong> and <strong>impactful</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here’s how Nike does it, and how you can (just) do it too:</p>\n<h2>Creative</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Utilize innovative technology and gamification.</strong></p>\n<p>Product innovation is a big part of Nike’s success, so it’s no surprise that the brand likes to think outside the box on social, too. In 2018, Nike teamed up with conversational AI platform, Snaps, to create a Facebook Messenger Bot for its Air Jordan brand. The bot delivered content from the Air Jordan blog and Jordan.com and enabled users to shop, read and engage in two-way conversations with the brand. Incredibly, the brand reported that the content was generating 87% open rates vs. the typical 15-20% from emails.</p>\n<p>Gamification is another way Nike turns heads on social. With the Nike+ app, the brand motivates consumers to share their fitness-related accomplishments on their social channels. It turns users’ daily physical activity into a community builder by inspiring a little friendly competition among their social connections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Getting started: </em>Employing a creative use of technology is one sure-fire ways to pique customer interest and get people talking about your brand. Consider partnering with either an existing or emerging tech solution like Nike did with Snaps. Do some social listening to surface trends and interests relevant to your industry. And don’t be afraid to tap into your audience’s competitive spirit when you invite them to engage with your brand or product on social.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Explore new video content.</strong></p>\n<p>Nike commercials are infamous. The inspirational music, the motivational voiceover. They’ve pretty much nailed the formula at this point. But in order to keep that formula feeling fresh, the brand team makes regular use of the different video formats and functionalities available to them on social. Some videos like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAiNzopguJS/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this one</a> employ the familiar “voice-over-inspirational-footage” format. But they also <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CASprIDgOOO/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mix it up</a> by replacing the voiceover with simple, on-screen text, or the video footage with static images or unedited user-generated content. They also take advantage of platforms like YouTube and IGTV to feature more long-form content like their fictional mini-series, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XB-qtSaYW0&#38;feature=youtu.be&#38;list=PLgQiB1hnVoC2rwxUXgVZzPLG3j4N40urE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Margot Vs. Lily</a>,” and their documentary-style “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B8rO4zgg0Zw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Common Thread</a>” series.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\"><iframe title=\"Ingrid Silva &#38; Alex Thomas, Narrated by Serena Williams | Common Thread | Nike\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQPCgifTL_I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Getting started: </em>Until recently, effective video content might not have been an option for some brands limited by small teams and budgets. But the global pandemic has leveled the playing field. Many brands (including ours) have been forced to quickly <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/remote-creative-content-production/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adapt video production</a> in the absence of studios, equipment and IRL subjects. Luckily, limitations often lead to the most creative solutions. Take a page from Nike’s book and make use of UGC and on-screen text. Or breath new life into old footage with a little editing magic and a simple voice-over.</p>\n<h2>Memorable</h2>\n<p><strong>3. Embrace emotional storytelling.</strong></p>\n<p>Brands across every industry are pivoting away from product-focused marketing to more emotional storytelling in an effort to make deeper connections with their audience. And no one does it better than Nike. Most of their advertising doesn’t make specific mention of its products. Why? Because Nike doesn’t sell shoes—it sells a belief. It sells the belief that anyone who works hard and puts their mind to it can overcome any obstacle and emerge a victor. It’s a classic hero narrative and it’s the core story behind every piece of marketing they create. Even when the brand is showcasing one of their pro athlete partners (a pillar of its social strategy) it uses <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6QjxOvAs-7/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the athlete’s story</a> to reinforce Nike’s message of possibility, and to inspire the next generation.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just a kid from Akron, building a legacy that extends far beyond the basketball court. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JustDoIt?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JustDoIt</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kTtmFQGDdi\">https://t.co/kTtmFQGDdi</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nike (@Nike) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1207682042701348864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 19, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p><em>Getting started: </em>At the heart of every great emotional story is a simple, yet profound insight. Nike’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYP9AGtLvRg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Find Your Greatness</a> campaign was a response to the widely-held belief among their target audience that “greatness” was only reserved for prodigies and superstars. What about your audience? What are their challenges and pain points? What beliefs do they hold that could be holding them back? As brands, we win when we help people see possibilities. Position your brand as the key to unlocking their potential.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Keep it simple.</strong></p>\n<p>Notice how simple “Find your greatness” is. Or “Just do it.” To be memorable, your message needs to be, you know, easy to remember. There’s a familiarity and simplicity about Nike’s brand creative, especially on social. Take <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nikebasketball/status/1139383715904180224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this tweet</a>, for example. The tweet reads, “It’s only crazy until you do it.” Seven small words sure to plant a seed in your head, and hopefully, your heart.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It’s only crazy until you do it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/justdoit?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#justdoit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nike?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nike</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NBAFinals?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NBAFinals</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Awikq1nMdE\">pic.twitter.com/Awikq1nMdE</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nike Basketball (@nikebasketball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nikebasketball/status/1139383715904180224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 14, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p><em>Getting started: </em>“Omit needless words” is one of my favorite writing principles originating from the infamous style guide, The Elements of Style by Strunk &#38; White. And it’s a great reminder for marketers who typically default to over-explaining and drowning their audience in details. The beauty of distilling your message down to just a few words is that you force yourself to get to the core of your idea, and pack all your passion into a simple phrase, image or idea.</p>\n<h2>Impactful</h2>\n<p><strong>5. Champion causes you believe in.</strong></p>\n<p>As part of a long-term plan to show young athletes that the brand was committed to social justice, Nike partnered with NFL free agent Colin Kaepernick for a cause-related campaign in 2018. And just like Kaepernick’s decision to kneel in protest during the national anthem, the move was met with both high praise and serious criticism. Undeterred by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nike-advert-with-colin-kaepernick-has-people-burning-products-2018-9?IR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the backlash</a>, Nike remains committed to cause-related marketing on their social channels. In support of the growing racial justice movement, the brand has made it clear where it stands in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBWoCspj9FH/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back-to-back posts</a>. But the brand isn’t just offering words of support for the issues they care about—they’ve also shared plans for action. Take <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1257403909791821824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this tweet</a> for instance, pledging products to help frontline healthcare workers during the pandemic.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We will continue to stand up for equality and work to break down barriers for athletes* all over the world.<br /> <br />For more information: <a href=\"https://t.co/CQvZhwEYFT\">https://t.co/CQvZhwEYFT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ekOaUM4qAA\">pic.twitter.com/ekOaUM4qAA</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nike (@Nike) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1271585740980285442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 12, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p><em>Getting started: </em>Gone are the days of staying neutral and “staying out of it.” Consumers today want brands to take a stand, and we’ve got the data to prove it. According to our recent <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/brands-creating-change/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brands Get Real report</a>, 70% of consumers say it’s important for brands to take a stand on social and political issues, up from 66% in 2017. And nearly half of consumers (47%) want brands to take a stand on social. In our <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-spotlight-ben-and-jerrys/\">Ben &#38; Jerry’s</a> Social Spotlight, we mention the importance of establishing the causes most important to your brand. I also recommend <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/features/social-media-listening/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a good social listening tool</a> to find out which issues your audience cares about to ensure your values are aligned. A great place to start after that is to find an organization or movement leader doing meaningful work for the cause you’re looking to champion, and propose a partnership.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Partner with influencers.</strong></p>\n<p>No brand understands the power of influencers like Nike. Sure, more eyes on your product means more potential purchases—but it’s also a connection play. What better way to engage with your audience than to create content with the athletes and artists they love most? Scroll through Nike’s Instagram and Twitter feeds and you’ll see a lot of famous faces: Serena Williams, Tiger Woods, Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, just to name a few. But then there’s Nike’s more unexpected influencer partnerships, like father and son co-hosts Dan and Lincoln Markham of the popular YouTube channel, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&#38;v=DbCHxSF67mA&#38;feature=emb_logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“What’s Inside?”</a> In collaboration with Nike, the two created seven sponsored videos documenting a trip to Nike’s headquarters, including one in which they cut Nike’s latest shoe, the Air Vapormax, in half. The series was a huge hit and expanded Nike’s reach beyond their typical audience.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\"><iframe title=\"What&#039;s inside Nike Air VaporMax?\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DbCHxSF67mA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Getting started: </em>Instead of wondering if your brand content will resonate, use the voices you know your audience already listens to. Now, Nike-sponsored athletes are some of the most well-known artists and athletes in the world. But you don’t need A-list celebrities to create content your audience will love. You just might need to think a little outside the box, like Nike did with “What’s Inside?” I know I’m a broken record by now, but social listening is the number one way to surface these nano and micro-influencers straight from your audience’s conversations on social. A sophisticated tool will show you an influencer’s follower count and potential reach of your message.</p>\n<p><strong>BONUS TIP: Find <em>your</em> greatness.</strong></p>\n<p>I realize that Nike is one of the biggest brands in the world. You might read this and think, “but we’re not Nike.” But that’s the beauty of their brand’s core message: <em>Anyone</em> can be great. With <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the right tools</a> and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the right strategy,</a> your brand can overcome any obstacle—whether it’s a limited budget, tough competition or you’re just starting out. Nike had to start somewhere, and today, you can too. Just do it.</p>\n<p>This post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-spotlight-nike/\">Social Spotlight: Nike and how to outpace the competition on social</a> originally appeared on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/\">Sprout Social</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?a=H64tXek-lVg:wwvh9g-_eU4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?a=H64tXek-lVg:wwvh9g-_eU4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?i=H64tXek-lVg:wwvh9g-_eU4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?a=H64tXek-lVg:wwvh9g-_eU4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?i=H64tXek-lVg:wwvh9g-_eU4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?a=H64tXek-lVg:wwvh9g-_eU4:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SproutInsights/~4/H64tXek-lVg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:30:06 +0000","feedId":8983,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"391398a0d6efef913a48269ca45e41a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-12-00-459_d9c3376e888696cb.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"Michelle Grano","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-12-00-459_d9c3376e888696cb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?i=H64tXek-lVg:wwvh9g-_eU4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-14-32-552_e82660f4fab0ca4d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?i=H64tXek-lVg:wwvh9g-_eU4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn28@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-14-32-545_754f38a0c5cda7c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=TzevzKxY174":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-14-32-860_28ac336e89ccd3e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SproutInsights/~4/H64tXek-lVg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-14-32-259_2b7e89b66dab6424.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314288845},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:11:28","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:11:28","title":"How to use Facebook Messenger for business","link":"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/?p=109733/","description":"<p>With over <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1.3 billion users</a> every month, Messenger can be an invaluable <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-features/\">Facebook feature</a> for your business.

Generating high-quality leads</strong></h3>\n<p>There are several reasons why people will reach out to you via Facebook Messenger. Some will come to you about a customer service issue, while others will want to learn more about your product or service. No matter the scenario, opportunities open up for your business to follow up with special offers, new products and services and more.</p>\n<p>In other words, you get to <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-lead-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generate leads</a> through Facebook Messenger. On top of this, the leads you get through Facebook Messenger are particularly high-quality because they’re already familiar with your business, and they’ve already displayed an interest in your products and services.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can also set up ads that will lead clicks to Messenger and nurture them into valuable leads. This allows prospective customers to instantly connect with representatives to better understand how the product serves them. For One Doc Laser &#38; Aesthetic, this resulted in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/success/one-doc-laser-aesthetic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47% more messages received</a> compared to a previous campaign.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142611\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/Image-2020-08-03-at-12.36.57-PM.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad with click to Messenger option from One Doc\" width=\"404\" height=\"588\" /></figure>\n<p>For this strategy to work, keep in mind that you have to create a <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-ads-chatbots-copywriting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">highly compelling Facebook ad copy</a> that draws prospects in and makes them want to click the Messenger prompt.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Providing exceptional customer service</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to use Messenger for business is to provide customer service and support. Another <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/3-ways-messaging-is-transforming-the-path-to-purchase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook survey</a> found that 83% of U.S consumers message a business to ask about products or services. And 76% do so specifically to get support for a product or service.</p>\n<p>So Facebook Messenger offers a convenient way for your customers to message you for any queries or help with their problems. This gives you the opportunity to provide exceptional customer service through personalized interactions and quick resolutions.</p>\n<p>On top of this, you can also use Messenger to deliver other types of experiences that will further delight your customers. For instance, KLM Airlines used it to provide customers with boarding passes, check-in notifications and updates about their flight status.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142612 size-full\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/Image-2020-08-03-at-1.55.44-PM.png\" alt=\"boarding pass via message from KLM airlines\" width=\"400\" height=\"532\" /></figure>\n<p>Combined with the addition of a “Send Message” button for easier communication, the airline company was able to see a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/success/klm-messenger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5-point higher average Net Promoter Score</a> on Messenger than its initial goal.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Enabling transactions for a better experience</strong></h3>\n<p>The previously-cited Facebook study also found that 75% of U.S consumers messaged a business to make a purchase or reservation. With the right <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chat flow set up</a>, a customer can contact a business to ask some questions, and then easily buy something or make a reservation after getting their answers. This seamless experience will work wonders on your customer satisfaction rate as well as conversions.</p>\n<p>Use the opportunity to enable transactions through Facebook Messenger and ensure a better shopping experience. If you’re selling a service or have a longer sales cycle, Facebook Messenger can help create additional, personalized touchpoints and drive increased conversions.</p>\n<p>Kiehl’s, the luxury beauty brand, was able to leverage Facebook Messenger bots for business to close the conversion loop for their social presence in Vietnam. The brand set up a bot on Messenger to answer questions and help customers browse through products. This resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/success/kiehls-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">22% increase in sales</a> compared to sales during the non-campaign period.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Building trust in your brand</strong></h3>\n<p>The ability to directly speak to a brand can give customers more confidence before making a purchase. Messenger allows you to open a direct line of communication between your business and your customers, so there’s more transparency along with a better connection. Facebook even found that 69% of U.S consumers feel more confident about a brand they can message.</p>\n<h2><strong>Best practices to use Facebook Messenger for business</strong></h2>\n<p>Knowing why you should use Messenger for business isn’t enough; you should also maximize its potential using the following best practices:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Be responsive</strong></h3>\n<p>Responsiveness could make or break the customer experience on Facebook Messenger. According to a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/live-chat-go-to-market-flaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HubSpot study</a>, consumers typically expect businesses to respond on a live chat in 10 minutes or less. This is much faster than the <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-response-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1 hour response rate</a> expected on typical social media channels. So it’s crucial that you use Messenger for business to provide quick and relevant responses to your customers about sales and support queries.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142613\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/Image-2020-08-04-at-10.45.27-AM.png\" alt=\"HubSpot findings on how consumers expect instant responses\" width=\"950\" height=\"609\" /></figure>\n<p>It’s not always possible to have agents monitoring your chat 24/7. Instead, you could also set up a Facebook Messenger bot for business to solve basic problems any time of day. <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/features/social-media-automation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Automating some aspects of your social media</a> will help you efficiently manage conversations without racking up costs. Beyond the issues that a bot can’t solve, you can create a chat flow to schedule a follow-up with a live agent during working hours.</p>\n<p>Sprout Social offers a comprehensive <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/sprout-chatbot-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bots Builder</a> that’s easy to use and set up even if you’re completely new to the scene. The tool helps you visualize the customer&#8217;s journey when they interact with your Facebook Messenger bot. This makes it easier to configure it to provide relevant experiences.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/PI_Bots_Builder.png\" alt=\"Sprout bot builder\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1218\" /></figure>\n<h3><strong>2. Keep things personalized</strong></h3>\n<p>You offer a personalized experience when you greet customers by name, and you can increase personalization by seamlessly continuing their previous conversations with your business. Offering this type of personalization through Facebook Messenger will help you deliver an exceptional customer experience.</p>\n<p>Here’s where the <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/features/smart-inbox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sprout Smart Inbox</a> feature comes in handy with its built-in system for managing customer relationships and conversation history. This lets you quickly pull up all the past conversations and notes for a specific customer, enabling you to give relevant responses and resolutions.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/PI_Engagement_Contact_Facebook_Messenger_Direct_Message.png\" alt=\"Sprout Smart Inbox\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1218\" /></figure>\n<h3><strong>3. Maintain your brand voice</strong></h3>\n<p>Your brand voice shouldn’t just extend to your social posts and emails; it should be consistent across all brand communications. That includes your conversations via Facebook Messenger as well. So besides training your live chat agents, make sure your chatbot responses align with your brand voice too.</p>\n<h2><strong>Winning with Messenger for business</strong></h2>\n<p>Considering its potential to enhance customer experience and boost sales, using Facebook Messenger makes sense for all industries.

Plus, these communities are fun for your audience to chat with like-minded people.</p>\n<p>To help you further understand what exactly a brand community is, why they&#8217;re so important for your business and how to build a successful one, we&#8217;ve put together this quick guide to share with you.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n<h2>What is a brand community?</h2>\n<p>In the simplest terms, a <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/adapt/brand-community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand community</a> showcases brand loyalty at its best. People in your brand community are emotionally invested; they will buy from your company, digest your content, tell their friends and family about your company, and more.</p>\n<p>But a brand community is <strong>not</strong> the same as brand awareness.</p>\n<p>Just because someone knows about or has purchased from your brand doesn’t mean they’re part of an engaged or even an engageable brand community.</p>\n<p>Instead, your brand community is people who follow all of your content on social media, who share your products/services and content with others, and who enjoy seeing everything your brand does.</p>\n<p>More simply put, a brand community is a place where people who have an <em><strong>emotional connection</strong></em> to your brand can connect with each other and with your brand.</p>\n<h2>Why should you build a brand community?</h2>\n<p>It’s important to understand that your brand community <strong>already exists</strong> on social media. It’s your job to find this community, connect with it directly, and build a strategy for individuals within the community to interact with each other.</p>\n<p>And you want to do this because your brand community is a powerful business tool.</p>\n<p>Imagine having a group of people who regularly use your product or service that you can regularly reach out to. With this group, you can test new product mockups, ask about feature releases, share blog content, and collect general feedback for improvement.</p>\n<p>Because this community can help your brand to make customer-driven decisions <em>and</em> spread the word about your business, make sure you&#8217;re building a strong community that thrives and rewards your community members.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how you can build a successful brand community that is mutually beneficial to both your brand and your audience.</p>\n<h2>How to build a successful brand community</h2>\n<p>There are already people out there who love your brand. Now it&#8217;s time to rally them all together and build a space for them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/webinars/community-building/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building a successful brand community</a> can appear in many different forms, and there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all strategy. However, we&#8217;ll walk you through a few essential steps that can help you determine the best brand community for you.</p>\n<h3>1. Define your brand</h3>\n<p>If you want to build a community around your brand, you need to know what your brand is. This goes beyond what your business sells or offers.</p>\n<p>This involves your mission, company vision, <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/brand-voice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand voice</a> and personality. What is your brand trying to do? Who is it trying to help? What does it want to be known for?</p>\n<p>All of these are important to define before building a community. Because the more you showcase what your brand is all about, the more you&#8217;ll attract the target audience you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<h3>2. Define your brand goal and metrics</h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, brand communities are a way for you to make customer-driven decisions and spread the word about your business. But you should ask yourself a lot of questions before creating a brand community.</p>\n<p>These are just a few sample questions you should ask to guide you in the right direction when developing a strategy for your brand community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ultimately, what&#8217;s the purpose behind the community?</li>\n<li>Are you helping people get answers to questions on your product? Or about their profession?</li>\n<li>What are you doing for your community members to stay engaged?</li>\n<li>How are you measuring success of your brand community?</li>\n<li>What metrics do you want to track? Lead generations? Conversions?</li>\n<li>How will your brand community goals help with your company goals? For example, how will a brand community help marketing, support, sales?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you set these goals and metrics, the next two steps will be easier to handle.</p>\n<h3>3. Choose a community platform</h3>\n<p>There are several different options when it comes to creating your brand community&#8217;s home base.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll cover a few popular ones as well as successful examples so you can consider a few options of what might work best for your brand and audience.</p>\n<h4>Forum</h4>\n<p>A forum is a great way for a much larger community to be able to talk about shared interests, whether they&#8217;re directly about the brand or not.</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://community.spotify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spotify&#8217;s community</a>, for example. Because Spotify is a massive music streaming platform with a wide audience, a forum works perfectly for them.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142560\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.38.23-PM.png\" alt=\"brand community - spotify's community forum\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1122\" /></figure>\n<p>Whether people are talking about the music they love or sharing new artists or playlists on the platform, forums are a great way for Spotify&#8217;s brand to cultivate conversations around their industry with their music streaming platform being right at the center of it.</p>\n<h4>Social media</h4>\n<p>There are two different ways you can manage your community on social media – by engaging through your platform or by creating a social media group.</p>\n<p>One great example of a brand who uses their social media presence for community building is jewelry retailer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ringconcierge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ring Concierge</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram Business Account</a> is run by the woman who owns the company, and she&#8217;s very hands on and transparent with her audience. She uses the brand&#8217;s Instagram stories to regularly communicate with her audience, often holding Q&#38;As and having followers vote on potential new products.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142561\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6080.png\" alt=\"brand community - ring concierge instagram stories\" width=\"400\" height=\"711\" /></figure>\n<p>Communities can also be built through a hashtag, similar to how photo editing app A Color Story has done. They feature photos that are posted using the <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/hashtag-marketing-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">branded hashtag</a> #AColorStory on their feed, building brand loyalty and adding user-generated authenticity to their feed.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142562\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-10.21.20-PM.png\" alt=\"brand community - a color story hashtag\" width=\"1898\" height=\"1016\" /></figure>\n<p>The last way to use social media is by creating an actual group that your customers and community members join and use to interact with you. Facebook or LinkedIn groups are the most popular for this.</p>\n<p>See an example below from graphic design software Visme. They created a Facebook Group called The Visme Lounge, where their most loyal and engaged users go to share their designs and gather ideas.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142563\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-10.28.03-PM.png\" alt=\"brand community - visme lounge\" width=\"1884\" height=\"1032\" /></figure>\n<p>Since brands can create and manage Facebook Groups, it makes it much easier to use this avenue as a successful brand community platform.</p>\n<h4>Rewards or affiliate programs</h4>\n<p>Another way to hone in on your brand community is by creating a program that gives back to your most loyal customers or referrals.</p>\n<p>A rewards program often gives regular customers perks, and a great example of this can be seen with <a href=\"https://www.starbucks.com/rewards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Starbucks</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142564\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-10.37.37-PM.png\" alt=\"brand community - starbucks rewards\" width=\"2550\" height=\"1344\" /></figure>\n<p>Each time a rewards member places an order through the Starbucks app, they earn Stars that add up to perks, such as free espresso shots or free drinks.</p>\n<p>An affiliate program is another way to reward loyal customers and people who refer customers to your business. By creating a program that allows these customers to receive a payout for each person they refer, you&#8217;re building a bigger and better community.</p>\n<h4>Third-party community platforms</h4>\n<p>Many times, brands choose to use third-party platforms to help them facilitate a community.</p>\n<p>Options for this include sites like <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobilize.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mobilize</a>, where you can create various channels/topics for your community members to check out and start conversations in.</p>\n<h3>4. Regularly engage with your brand community</h3>\n<p>Give your community members a reason to stay involved.

Your brand mission will be a cornerstone in every other aspect of your branding process. And it will help your audience understand the purpose of your brand and what it aims to accomplish.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s learn more about mission statements, why they&#8217;re important, and how to draft one.</p>\n<h2>What is a brand mission statement?</h2>\n<p>A brand mission statement clearly communicates a brand&#8217;s purpose, objectives and how it plans to serve its audience. It is action-oriented and gives readers an idea of what your business does and what impact it wants to make. This statement may shift over time as the company grows and redefines its goals.</p>\n<p>Asana&#8217;s mission statement is a great example of how a brand mission can be broad yet specific to the company&#8217;s goals.</p>\n<p>Its mission is &#8220;to help humanity thrive by enabling the world’s teams to work together effortlessly.&#8221;</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142657\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/asana-brand-mission.png\" alt=\"Asana brand mission statement\" width=\"1500\" height=\"624\" /></figure>\n<p>The message gets straight to the point and is descriptive enough that defines what Asana stands for. The brand missions incorporates the larger impact the brand wants to make as well as the more practical role it plays in its user&#8217;s lives.</p>\n<h2>Brand mission vs. other elements your brand</h2>\n<p>It can be easy to confuse the brand mission with other parts of your branding, like brand voice and brand identity. While they are related, each of these elements plays a different role in shaping your brand. Here&#8217;s how:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brand mission:</strong> The mission statement aims to create an emotional connection with your audience. It describes the brand&#8217;s purpose and why it exists.</li>\n<li><strong>Brand voice</strong>: Your <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/brand-voice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand voice</a> is the style in which your brand talks to your audience. The voice you use to communicate says a lot about your brand. Some brands take on a very authoritative and professional voice, while others tend to be more playful, humorous or sarcastic. Your brand voice should reflect your audience and the way you want your brand to be perceived.</li>\n<li><strong>Brand identity:</strong> Brand identity tends to define the visual elements of your brand. Easily identifiable details such as your brand colors, fonts or general aesthetic will make up your brand identity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many brands create a <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-style-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">style guide</a> or brand guide that illustrates every aspect of their brand. Style guides includes their mission and vision statements, brand voice and brand identity.</p>\n<h3>Mission statements vs. vision statements</h3>\n<p>Whereas your <strong>mission statement</strong> defines your brand&#8217;s goals, objectives and approach, the <strong>vision statement</strong> describes the long-term impact you want to make with your mission.</p>\n<p>More simply stated: the mission describes what your brand aims to achieve and how you will achieve it. The vision statement defines where you want those achievements to lead in the future.</p>\n<p>Ikea&#8217;s mission and vision statements give people good insight into the purpose of their brand and the impact they want to make in the world.</p>\n<p>Below are Ikea&#8217;s mission and vision statements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mission statement: Offer a wide range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them.</li>\n<li>Vision statement: Create a better everyday life for many people.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142769\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/ikea-mission-vision-statements.png\" alt=\"Ikea's brand mission and vision statements\" width=\"1250\" height=\"1073\" /></figure>\n<h2>Why are mission statements important?</h2>\n<p>Defining a clear mission for your brand will help you <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/target-audience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">identify your target audience</a>. Once you have a clearly defined mission statement, you can tie everything your brand does to that mission. It can act as a perfect elevator pitch when presenting your brand to a new audience. It can also be an excellent barometer for determining whether new projects align with your overall brand mission.</p>\n<p>Your mission statement should be a defining factor for both your audience and your employees. A brand mission statement should also be a framework that your employees can follow when making decisions or speaking on behalf of the organization. Lastly, the mission statement can be an important factor to present to potential partners and investors and easily convey the value that your brand brings.</p>\n<h2>Creating your brand mission statement</h2>\n<p>Defining something as integral as a mission statement can seem like a daunting task if you&#8217;re just starting.</p>\n<p>A great first step is to research some of the mission statements of other brands in your industry. Of course, your mission statement should be authentic and representative of your brand. But you can draw inspiration from how other brands have defined their missions.</p>\n<p>Next, make a list of your brand&#8217;s goals and the impact you hope to make to your audience, and in the world. Your mission statement should also reflect your long-term goals. Even though you can adjust the statement as your goals shift, you should write your brand mission with longevity in mind. It should reflect the larger purpose of the brand and stay relevant for at least 2-3 years.</p>\n<p>Here are a few questions to ask during the process of crafting a brand mission statement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In what ways does the brand add value to its audience?</li>\n<li>What is the larger impact you want to achieve by offering this help?</li>\n<li>Are these goals actionable and realistic?</li>\n<li>Can the brand embody this mission in every aspect of the organization?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Keep it concise</h3>\n<p>Your mission statement doesn&#8217;t need to be long. A few concise sentences will suffice. You can have a longer and more robust internal business plan for employees. But the mission statement you share with the public should be succinct.</p>\n<p>TED&#8217;s mission statement is exactly two words: Spread Ideas.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a perfect representation of their brand that is known for sharing short yet highly valuable content for virtually anyone. Their mission statement gets straight to the point and is perfectly on-brand with what they stand for as a company.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142656\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/TED-brand-mission-1.png\" alt=\"TED brand mission\" width=\"1500\" height=\"600\" /></figure>\n<h3>Make it a team effort</h3>\n<p>When crafting a brand mission, it helps to have people from all areas of your organization involved in the process. Your social media team is likely well-positioned to help refine the brand mission and implement it into social media content. When you have the first draft of a mission statement ready, gather feedback from employees. Their feedback is valuable in understanding whether your mission carries itself internally. Employee feedback may be able to highlight gaps between the mission itself and the internal culture of your brand.</p>\n<h2>How to embody your brand mission in all aspects of your organization</h2>\n<p>Historically, brands have avoided taking controversial stands in politics and other sensitive topics. Today, people are looking more closely at which brands align with their values. Consumers are becoming more critical of which brands they advocate for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/social-media-connection/\">According to our research</a>, 53% of consumers feel more connected to brands whose values align with their own.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2019/04/brands-get-real-chart-3-1.png\" width=\"780\" height=\"780\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/brand-authenticity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand authenticity</a>, especially on social media, is more important than ever. If your brand mission is not authentic and aligned with your actions, your audience will notice.</p>\n<p>Recently, many brands have made public statements of support and adjusted their missions to include initiatives on racial injustices and representing diversity. On the surface, these statements seemed well-intentioned. But consumers realized that, in some cases, these statements didn&#8217;t reflect in the organization&#8217;s actions.</p>\n<p>With the level of resources and information available to the public, performative support on social media is not enough. Consumers want to see how a brand&#8217;s actions back up the statements they make.</p>\n<p>When creating a mission statement, brands need to make sure that they&#8217;re ready to embody that statement fully. That means observing how they can make changes in all aspects of their organization, both internally and in the public eye.</p>\n<p>Your brand mission needs to be reflected in all aspects of your organization. This includes your hiring process, internal communication practices, marketing and everywhere in between.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Even though you want to get your mission statement right, it&#8217;s important to remember that you can always adjust it. The statement should be broad enough to reflect the brand&#8217;s long term mission, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t change. As a brand changes and sets new goals, the mission statement can shift to reflect that growth and change. It&#8217;s a good idea to revisit the mission statement every 2-3 years to make sure it still aligns with the brand&#8217;s goals and purpose.</p>\n<p>As the social media landscape changes, consumers will continue to push brands to have more intentional missions.

But as the platforms developed and the user base grew, money needed to be made, brands found opportunity to participate and reach their customers in a new way. Nowadays, it seems unimaginable for a new business to open up without any social media presence.</p>\n<p>The direct-to-consumer (DTC) model is still relatively new when compared to brick-and-mortar retail shops. For those that are solely based online, an investment in social media comprises a significant part of the marketing budget. When companies like Warby Parker and Casper first launched, the DTC model was fresh and unique. Nowadays, nearly every retail segment has a DTC brand and the competition is heavy with new brands.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width: 1000px;\" src=\"https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/187439/share-of-e-commerce-sales-in-total-us-retail-sales-in-2010.jpg\" alt=\"Statistic: Quarterly share of e-commerce sales of total U.S. retail sales from 1st quarter 2010 to 1st quarter 2020 | Statista\" /></figure>\n<p>In 2010, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/187439/share-of-e-commerce-sales-in-total-us-retail-sales-in-2010/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ecommerce sales</a> made up only 4.2% of total US retail sales. One decade later, the number is now 11.8% and it’s only steadily climbing. In 2020, as the pandemic continues to prohibit retail companies from opening their stores, having an ecommerce marketing strategy seems more needed than ever.</p>\n<h2>Why use social selling for ecommerce?</h2>\n<p>For DTC brands that exist solely online and retailers shifting to an online-first presence, you need all the tools in your arsenal to push sales on your website. You can’t rely on foot traffic so social media replaces this tactic.</p>\n<p>Social selling is not only the actual sale of items directly from the brand to the consumer. It also includes the interactions that take place on social media before a sale, including research, word-of-mouth, direct interactions with the brand and more. With new features such as Instagram Shop, the entire shopping process can take place on social media.</p>\n<p>Ecommerce sales are heavily influenced by the online world, and it makes sense for brands to use social media to drive them. At least <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">72% of US adults</a> use some type of social media. Since your customer is very likely already on social media, you want to go where the customers are.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to approach social selling and as some brands have demonstrated, there isn’t one “right” way.</p>\n<h2>Use organic and paid strategies</h2>\n<p>On social media, a <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/paid-organic-social-media-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">combination of organic and paid strategies</a> is usually the preferred way to go.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-142804\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/consumers-find-brands.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"427\" height=\"405\" /></figure>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sprout Index Above &#38; Beyond</a>, consumers find brands on social media in a variety of ways. Forty percent of consumers find new brands from their personal network, 35% from influencers they follow and 32% from word-of-mouth. Two of the three methods of discovery are from organic strategies, but all have the potential to be conducted through paid social as well.</p>\n<p>We’ll go into a little more detail on some of these strategies but here are some examples of what organic and paid social  strategies look like for ecommerce.</p>\n<p><strong>Organic social media strategies for ecommerce</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presence of and use of product reviews on your social media accounts</li>\n<li>Adding relevant hashtags to increase the discoverability of your brand</li>\n<li>Personalized interaction with customers on your accounts and theirs</li>\n<li>Providing excellent social customer care</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/user-generated-content-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">user-generated content</a> to further your social proof</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/features/social-media-listening/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social listening</a> to improve your product and discover new customers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Paid social media strategies for ecommerce</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paid advertisements and post boosts</li>\n<li>Using lookalike audiences and website visitors to supplement your advertising</li>\n<li>Running <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/influencer-marketing-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">influencer marketing campaigns</a></li>\n<li>Creating a <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/brand-ambassadors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand ambassador program</a></li>\n<li>Forming brand partnerships</li>\n<li>Creating a referral or affiliate program</li>\n<li>Running advertisements and boosts of any of the organic strategies mentioned above</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Set up shop on social</h2>\n<p>Shopping within a network is easier than ever on Instagram and Facebook. Use these platforms’ features to make shopping and product discoverability on social media a seamless experience for your customers.</p>\n<p>Instagram and Facebook share the same backend operation for shopping. After loading in your product catalog or linking your website’s ecommerce platform (such as Shopify and WooCommerce), you’ll be able to start tagging products on your posts.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-143067\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/innisfreeshop-example-542x1024.jpg\" alt=\"tagged product in Instagram\" width=\"350\" height=\"661\" /></figure>\n<p>When products are shown on Instagram posts, they can be tagged, allowing customers to view purchase details with a tap. Clicking on the tagged product will lead you to the product’s website page for you to purchase. The browser pops up within Instagram so when you close out or finish your purchase, you can go right back to browsing.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/parachute-pinterest.png\" alt=\"parachute pinterest products\" width=\"911\" height=\"647\" /></figure>\n<p>Pinterest, a network known to consumers for discovering and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/how-to-sell-on-pinterest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">researching new products</a>, has its own Shop feature. Once your website’s product pins are enabled, pins show the price and are listed in the Shop section of your page. Parachute is an online-only, DTC home goods brand that utilizes both product pins and promoted pins on Pinterest.</p>\n<h2>Use social proof</h2>\n<p>Word-of-mouth and reviews are still tried-and-true tactics for encouraging purchases.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/Do-you-read-online-reviews-for-local-businesses-scaled-1.png\" alt=\"read online reviews\" /><br />\nBrightLocal found that <a href=\"https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">82% of consumers</a> read online reviews of local businesses, 91% of consumers say positive reviews make them more likely to use a business and 76% trust online reviews as much as recommendations from family and friends.</p>\n<p>For networks like Facebook that allow reviews to be turned on, it makes business sense to allow your customers to leave reviews. <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/how-to-ask-for-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ask for more reviews</a> from your customers on a continuing basis and you’ll be supplemented with social proof. Reviews are even better when they’re <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/features/social-media-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">managed and responded to from the brand</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-143068\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/wearingwarby-example-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"warby parker instagram story\" width=\"350\" height=\"623\" /></figure>\n<p>Another way of <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-proof/\">boosting your social proof</a> is to use an influencer marketing strategy. Warby Parker <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highlights notable customers in their Wearing Warby blog series, and also repurposes this content on their social feeds, including through an Instagram Stories highlight.</span></p>\n<h2>Use social listening</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/how-to-use-social-listening-tools/\">Social listening</a> can benefit all departments of your company. But for sales specifically, you can use social listening to identify gaps in your competitor’s strategy and see what your industry’s customers are talking about. These discussions can lead to new products, strategies and better customer service.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/PI_Listening_Competitive_Analysis_Performance.png\" alt=\"Sprout listening insights\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1218\" /></figure>\n<p>For an online-only company, social listening is imperative because you rely more on interactions and online activity to guide your strategies. Which leads us to setting yourself apart from others in an increasingly crowded social space.</p>\n<h2>Find your authentic voice &#38; be unique</h2>\n<p>Five years ago, DTC brands in the furniture retail segment were few and far between. Now, there are dozens of mid-century furniture manufacturers alone vying for your social attention. The same story has been repeated with DTC brands specializing in dozens of different market segments. How do you set yourself apart when the field is so crowded?</p>\n<p>One way to do this is to find a <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/brand-voice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand voice</a> that is authentic to your company. Paired with brand visuals, this is one of the first steps to getting noticed. Next, identify what makes you unique and different from others in your field. It could be your company’s story, a specialization or even your customer service.</p>\n<p>Research has found that <a href=\"https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">86% of buyers</a> are willing to pay more for a great customer experience. If all of your products are similar to your competitors’, then providing excellent <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/topics/customer-service-reputation-management/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social customer service</a> can set you apart from the pack.</p>\n<h2>Use analytics to guide your ecommerce sales</h2>\n<p>We mentioned social listening before but there are additional analytics you can take advantage of when approaching social selling. Using <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social media data to inform your sales plans</a> on an ongoing basis will only help your ROI.</p>\n<p>From social media analytics, you can find a multitude of ecommerce-related data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website clicks</li>\n<li>Profile visits</li>\n<li>Social shares from your website</li>\n<li>Mentions from customers</li>\n<li>Ad offers and click throughs</li>\n<li>Mentions of new products or campaigns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some analytics, like Instagram impression from the Explore page, are part of an organic ecommerce social strategy. Others, like website clicks or social-only offers, are more specific analytics that can help define your social ROI.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There are many tactics an ecommerce or DTC company can use on social media. But what most would agree with is that a social media presence is necessary to elevate your marketing. Social media helps your customers discover your brand, look at reviews, receive referrals from trusted sources and shop.</p>\n<p>Because the online landscape is constantly changing, it’s important to check in on your social selling strategy and look at new data relevant to your industry. COVID–19 has only pushed brands further into the ecommerce sphere and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/back-to-school-retail-trends-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">those retailers who are adapting to the changes</a> are the ones who will be most successful online.</p>\n<p>This post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-ecommerce/\">How to set ecommerce social media up for success</a> originally appeared on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/\">Sprout Social</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?a=eJg0Ss91clU:haSVkRFo01g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?a=eJg0Ss91clU:haSVkRFo01g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?i=eJg0Ss91clU:haSVkRFo01g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?a=eJg0Ss91clU:haSVkRFo01g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?i=eJg0Ss91clU:haSVkRFo01g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?a=eJg0Ss91clU:haSVkRFo01g:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SproutInsights/~4/eJg0Ss91clU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:13:54 +0000","feedId":8983,"bgimg":"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/www.statista.com/graphic/1/187439/share-of-e-commerce-sales-in-total-us-retail-sales-in-2010.jpg/","linkMd5":"0e3b13b5420ce36fe782165b660078a6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"Jenn Chen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/187439/share-of-e-commerce-sales-in-total-us-retail-sales-in-2010.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn90@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-14-33-576_f825f60401c106dc.webp","https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/consumers-find-brands.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-14-32-944_71ebfc4cff81047e.webp","https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/innisfreeshop-example-542x1024.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-14-32-832_a3f7db55958719aa.webp","https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/parachute-pinterest.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-14-31-478_2d0b5b33c466b94a.webp","https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/Do-you-read-online-reviews-for-local-businesses-scaled-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-14-31-536_4a8f1c71436ea1db.webp","https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/wearingwarby-example-576x1024.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-14-31-566_01be6907a4dc99e0.webp","https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/PI_Listening_Competitive_Analysis_Performance.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn78@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-14-31-619_fe90f9d8132042e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-12-00-459_d9c3376e888696cb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?i=eJg0Ss91clU:haSVkRFo01g:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn85@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-14-31-446_c9c58cafab8aab64.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?i=eJg0Ss91clU:haSVkRFo01g:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn97@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-14-31-469_a22a9195602ee5d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SproutInsights?d=TzevzKxY174":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-14-32-860_28ac336e89ccd3e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SproutInsights/~4/eJg0Ss91clU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn79@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-14-32-764_80375b5295756b7b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314288843},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:11:28","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:11:28","title":"Overwhelmed at work? Here’s how to talk to your boss about burnout","link":"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/?p=142832/","description":"<p>Today, brands&#8217; front doors are their social media profiles—and you, the social media managers, are the gatekeepers. That is not an easy job.</p>\n<p>Building an impactful, holistic social presence takes time, research, creativity and constant innovation. On top of that, you’re inundated with unexpected crises, emotionally charged consumer messages and constant change in social media trends. And you can’t just sign off or take a social media detox when the work becomes overwhelming. This constant balancing act can lead to <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/battling-social-media-burnout/\">burnout</a>.</p>\n<p>But I don’t have to tell you that. You’re a <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/open-letter-to-social-media-managers/\">social media manager in 2020</a>—you already know how this feels.</p>\n<p>What I am here to tell you is that feeling burnt out does not mean you are incapable of doing your job. It does mean you need to ask for help and have a conversation with your supervisor. In this article, we’ll explore ways to have effective conversations about burnout with your boss, and we’ll provide specific prompts to help you get started.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142913\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/01_Talk_About_Burnout_Chat_1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></figure>\n<h2><strong>Don’t suffer in silence </strong></h2>\n<p>Your boss likely has lots of things competing for their attention, so they may not be aware that you’re struggling unless you speak up. And while it may be intimidating to start the conversation, a lot of good can come from leveling with your supervisor and being honest about the challenges you face in your role.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Before I met other SMMs on Twitter- I felt like I was the only one experiencing burnout, fatigue, continuous overwhelm and many daily challenges. </p>\n<p>Thanks everyone for sharing your stories here, pulling back the curtain + creating a community that’s transparent and supportive!</p>\n<p>&#8212; Jenn Crim (@jenncrim) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenncrim/status/1293615840106090499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed at work, a conversation with your manager will help you challenge assumptions that you’re making about your own role and responsibilities and bring any invisible expectations to light. For instance, are you overscheduling yourself? Why do you feel the need to work to the point of burnout? Does your boss know that you&#8217;re working late every night? Do they actually expect you to be able to respond to messages immediately or is that an expectation you put on yourself? Uncover those answers so you can recalibrate if needed.</p>\n<p>Most, if not all, managers have been through a period of burnout themselves. In that case, they’ll have empathy for your situation as well as advice to get you back on track. Having a vulnerable conversation is also an opportunity to set new norms with your manager, like being transparent about your state of mind, feeling comfortable expressing blockers or even saying no when you don’t have the bandwidth.</p>\n<h2><strong>Get the ball rolling</strong></h2>\n<p>When you address burnout with your manager, you’ll need to get specific and provide context to help them understand what spurred on what you’re feeling. Here are a couple questions that can help you get to the root of the problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are your top priorities right now?</li>\n<li>What is holding you back from focusing on big picture projects?</li>\n<li>What is the most mentally draining aspect of your job?</li>\n<li>What tools or resources do you need to do your job more effectively?</li>\n<li>How do existing processes or management styles contribute to burnout?</li>\n<li>Is personal stress carrying over to work?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With an understanding of what challenge(s) you’re trying to solve, you can start the conversation with your boss more effectively.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142914\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/02_Talk_About_Burnout_Chat_2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"787\" /></figure>\n<p>When you’re ready to talk, it’s best to do it in person or via video call whenever possible, but getting it on your boss’s radar can start in writing with an email or Slack. Here are a few ways you can kick it off:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;ve been overwhelmed by the volume of messages I&#8217;ve been managing lately. Do you have time to chat about it this week?</li>\n<li>A lot of our recent projects have been really urgent. In our next one-on-one meeting, could we talk through top priorities?</li>\n<li>I&#8217;ve been putting out a lot of fires on social lately and it’s becoming unsustainable. Do you have time this week to chat about how we can get ahead of crises?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Propose solutions and demonstrate your value</strong></h2>\n<p>Approach your conversation with some solutions in mind. Think about what “better” will look like for you. Maybe that’s more time to focus on big picture projects, minimizing working after hours, new resources to manage your workload or more open communication between you and your manager.</p>\n<p>You’re not going to fix burnout in a single conversation, so start with a realistic and specific goal for your meeting. It will vary for each individual but here are a few suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Align on priorities and expectations</li>\n<li>Implement a new or different process</li>\n<li>Determine where you need more support and identify teammates or external resources, like a temp or contractor, that could help</li>\n<li>Develop or reorganize timelines</li>\n<li>Communicate roadblocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, the focus of your conversation should be on the impact your burnout has on not only you, but your team and business. You want to have a productive conversation, not a vent session. This is more likely to happen when you can show how burnout directly impacts your productivity, focus at work, the rest of your team and overall marketing goals.</p>\n<p>For example, you might say, “I’ve been unable to contribute to the business from a strategy perspective because I’ve been focused on execution and responding to inbound messages. If I had more time to hone in on our social data, I could bring really beneficial insights to the rest of the organization.” Showcasing how much more impact you could have on top line goals will inevitably pique your boss’s interest and make them invested in your recovery from burnout.</p>\n<p>While you should have an idea of what might fix the problems at hand, the onus is not solely on you. Your supervisor can and should help solidify the proposed solutions. At the end of your conversation, reiterate your plan of action to your manager and clarify any remaining confusion or concerns.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142915\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/03_Talk_About_Burnout_Chat_3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></figure>\n<h2><strong>Follow through and follow up</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you enact your agreed-upon plan, be patient with yourself. Immediate relief is not guaranteed. When you feel like you’ve had enough time to make an assessment of how things are going, set aside time to reflect. What’s changed since you spoke with your boss? What is working? What is not?</p>\n<p>If you’re still struggling after some time has passed and the solutions you came up with aren’t providing relief, don’t get down on yourself, clam up or accept defeat. You&#8217;ve already taken that first step—make it a point to follow up with your manager, continue the conversation and build off what was discussed initially. Together, you can decide how to tweak your original plan of action if it hasn’t been effective.</p>\n<p>Lastly, follow up even if things are working! Your boss will want to know that you’re feeling more productive, supported and revitalized.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142918\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/04_Talk_About_Burnout_Chat_4.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></figure>\n<h2><strong>Get the support you deserve</strong></h2>\n<p>Burnout is very real and pervasive in the social media marketing community.

What does it take to build up a gaming audience via social?</p>\n<p>Good questions! Our strategy guide to social media for gamers breaks it all down step-by-step.</p>\n<h2>8 strategies to level up your video gaming marketing</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that social media can potentially transform a seemingly smaller studio or game into a viral sensation.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen it in the past with Fortnite and more recently with Fall Guys. The more players and streamers share clips of your project, the more likely it is to snowball in popularity.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When we say Fall Guys is experiencing a lot of traffic&#8230;</p>\n<p>We had over 1.5 million new players in the first 24 hours! </p>\n<p>😳</p>\n<p>We&#39;re working on our first patch for the game, listening to ALL of your feedback and ideas, and are super grateful to everyone who&#39;s supported so far! ❤️ <a href=\"https://t.co/OpD714xu26\">pic.twitter.com/OpD714xu26</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Fall Guys 👑 (@FallGuysGame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1290971375386140673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 5, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>But before we get into the nitty-gritty, keep in mind that <strong>video gaming marketing is not one-size-fits-all</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rather than try to replicate the success of a certain game or team, it&#8217;s important to come up with a comprehensive social strategy that makes sense for your audience.</p>\n<p>In general, gamers are digital natives who are chronically online. A 2019 GlobalWebIndex report on Twitter usage found that 55% of gamers check in on the platform daily, and Twitter Insiders research found that 68% specifically do so to keep up with gaming news and trends. They&#8217;re plugged into the latest trends and memes, meanwhile representing a younger demographic (note that <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">59% of gamers</a> are under the age of 34).</p>\n<p>With all of that in mind, let&#8217;s dive into how to master gaming social media step-by-step.</p>\n<h3>1. Focus on hyping up live events such as streams, announcements and competitions</h3>\n<p>The popularity of livestreaming is well-documented, with Twitch scoring <a href=\"https://twitchtracker.com/statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">millions of average viewers</a> per day. Gamers are constantly on the hunt for new content to check out, preferably in real-time.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why so much of social media for gamers is centered around creating a sense of hype. After all, building anticipation gets people talking (and ultimately tuning in).</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at some examples. Check out how Bethesda hypes up their upcoming digital #QuakeCon, including a variety of panels and livestreaming events.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Get ready for three days of nonstop livestream content from around the globe during the 25th annual <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/QuakeCon?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#QuakeCon</a>!

Empower your community to market on your behalf</h3>\n<p>Gamers are among the most passionate of any type of fandom.</p>\n<p>Companies should do everything in their power to harness their audience&#8217;s sense of community and creativity.</p>\n<p>In other words, make a point to shout-out your fans when they show you love. For example, the Celeste Twitter account regularly shares <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/user-generated-content-guide/\">user-generated content</a> such as fanart.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142665\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/celeste-fanart.png\" alt=\"so much of social media for gamers includes sharing fan feedback and content such as fanart\" width=\"472\" height=\"764\" /></figure>\n<p>If you have seriously dedicated fans, don&#8217;t be shy about showing them off. In addition to the popularity of fanart, the explosion of interest in virtual photography through many games’ photo modes has led to even more UGC to highlight on social media.</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<div id=\"fb-root\"></div>\n<p><script async=\"1\" defer=\"1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#38;version=v8.0\" nonce=\"7QedJP1O\"></script></p>\n<div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/505Games/posts/10158078837619681\" data-width=\"600\">\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/505Games/posts/10158078837619681\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\">\n<p>Last week, we asked Virtual Photographers of #DeathStrandingPC to share with us their top spots for capturing that&#8230;</p>\n<p>Posted by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/505Games/\">505 Games</a> on&#160;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/505Games/posts/10158078837619681\">Monday, August 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Anything you can do to foster a sense of community is a plus.

In short, let your community know that you&#8217;re listening to them and empower them to be your loudest advocates.</p>\n<h3>5. Be transparent when there&#8217;s a problem</h3>\n<p>Remember what we said about gamers being passionate and opinionated?</p>\n<p>The same rules apply when they&#8217;re popping off about a bug or problem with whatever they&#8217;re playing.</p>\n<p>Simply put, don&#8217;t try to sweep bugs or server outages under the rug.

Maintain a thick skin when dealing with trolls</h3>\n<p>Although social media for gamers <em>should</em> focus primarily on fans, dealing with naysayers is inevitable.</p>\n<p>Call-outs. Negative review bombs. Straight-up trolls. The list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>Look no further than pretty much any gaming thread on Twitter which talks about features related to a new console (or anything vaguely related to the &#8220;console wars&#8221;).</p>\n<div class=\"mx-auto my600 mw600 tc\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PlayStation has confirmed that you won&#39;t be able to play PS5 games with a DualShock 4, though the current-gen controller will still work with &#34;supported PS4 games.&#34; <a href=\"https://t.co/YSTilb7fBD\">https://t.co/YSTilb7fBD</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/KyjLbPWdHF\">pic.twitter.com/KyjLbPWdHF</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; IGN (@IGN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1290272549603966976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>The silver lining of gamers wanting to argue is that it makes for higher rates of engagement. That said, debates can quickly devolve into flame wars and spam.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important for companies to both moderate their social comments while also developing a thick skin.</p>\n<p>Note that the youngest demographics might be the loudest, but they&#8217;re not necessarily the ones speaking with their wallets. Make a point to respond to legitimate criticism or concerns and deal with trolls accordingly.</p>\n<h3>7. Understand the best practices of each platform</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re part of a relatively small team with limited resources for your video game marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>What are <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-channels/\">the best social media channels</a> for you? What platforms should you prioritize?</p>\n<p>The short answer is that it depends.</p>\n<p>As evidenced by all of the examples above, getting <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/how-to-get-more-followers-on-twitter/\">more followers on Twitter</a> should be a top priority when it comes to social media for gamers. The platform is prime for breaking news and already has a dedicated gaming audience.</p>\n<p>Facebook is fair game for studios as well, especially given that it&#8217;s such a popular place for offers and ads. Although Twitter is great for day-to-day updates, Facebook is arguably better for attracting attention to long-term promotions.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142688\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/Epic-Games-Facebook.png\" alt=\"epic games facebook\" width=\"517\" height=\"574\" /></figure>\n<p>Traditionally, Instagram for gamers is more focused on community updates and user-generated content. See Rockstar Games&#8217; Instagram bio for reference <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to the types of content they highlight specifically on IG</span>.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142689\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/rockstar-games-insta.png\" alt=\"rockstar games instagram\" width=\"411\" height=\"720\" /></figure>\n<p>Meanwhile, emerging platforms like TikTok are still the sort of wild west when it comes to gaming social media. That said, the billions of views on gaming-related hashtags should signal that there are opportunities for gaming studios and influencers to get on board.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142690\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/tiktok-gaming-hashtags.png\" alt=\"social media for gamers on tiktok\" width=\"443\" height=\"546\" /></figure>\n<h3>8. Post regularly and consistently</h3>\n<p>Finally, keep in mind that content in the gaming industry moves fast.</p>\n<p>Like, <em>really</em> fast.</p>\n<p>New games, trends and memes come and go more quickly than we can keep track of them. This speaks to the need for companies to post regularly and ensure that they aren&#8217;t letting their social feeds gather cobwebs.</p>\n<p>Consider the following posts to fill up a video game marketing content calendar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shout-outs and mentions from fans or streamers</li>\n<li>Live event announcements (streams, esports)</li>\n<li>User-generated content such as fanart or cosplays</li>\n<li>Press mentions and positive reviews</li>\n<li>Screenshots and videos from upcoming games</li>\n<li>In-game updates and bug fixes</li>\n<li>Questions for your community</li>\n<li>Time-sensitive offers and promotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all this content competing for your attention as a social media team, this is somewhere where a tool like Sprout Social can help in a big way. From managing your must-see promotions to ensuring you have something fresh for your follower every day, the ability to schedule out your <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-calendar/\">social media calendar</a> is key to keeping organized.</p>\n<figure class=\"tc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142685\" src=\"https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2020/08/sprout-social-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"sprout social content calendar\" width=\"953\" height=\"461\" /></figure>\n<p>And with that, we wrap up our guide to social media and gaming!</p>\n<h2>What does social media for gamers look like for your company?</h2>\n<p>Listen: gamers are a unique audience.
