Are your image dimensions to scale? Are you running the right type of ad? If we're being honest, it can get a little confusing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>With more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\">2.6 billion people</a> using Facebook every month,&nbsp;and nearly <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/\">1.7 billion users</a> every day, Facebook offers up a unique opportunity for marketers to augment their organic efforts. The trouble is, with both an investment of time and money on the line, there's not much room for oversight.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To help, we've put together a checklist to help you keep all of your campaign details straight. Or watch this short video on how to increase the effectiveness of your ads and budget.

Each ad set can hold a variety of ads that vary in color, copy, images, etc.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>With that terminology out of the way, let's dive in to creating an ad.</p> \n<h3>1. Create an account with Facebook Ads Manager.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-reporting-performance/\">Facebook's Ad Manager</a> is a sophisticated dashboard that provides users with an overview of all their campaigns.</p> \n<p>Upfront, the dashboard highlights an estimate of how much you're spending each day. The dashboard is organized by columns, which makes it easy to filter through your ads so you can create a custom view of your results. Key numbers like reach, frequency, and cost are readily available, making reporting on performance a no brainer.</p> \n<p>In order to use the Facebook Ads Manager, you'll need a Facebook Business Page (learn how to set one up <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5492/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page-in-5-simple-steps-with-video.aspx\">here</a>). This is because you can't run ads through personal profiles.</p> \n<p>Then, follow these steps:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Navigate to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager\">https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager</a>.</li> \n <li>Click the button that says \"Go to Ads Manager.\"</li> \n <li>Confirm your information on the ad account setup page.</li> \n <li>Set up your payment method.</li> \n <li>Save changes.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Once set up, the Ads Manager becomes the control center for your Facebook ads.</p> \n<h3>2. Start creating an ad through Facebook's Ads Manager.</h3> \n<p>Once you log into the Ads Manager, you'll see a performance dashboard where all of your campaigns, ad sets, and ads will be listed including the results they've driven for your Facebook page. Unless you've already created an ad for your Facebook page, this dashboard will be empty.</p> \n<p>To create a new campaign, ad set, or ad through the Facebook Ad Manager, tab over to the type of ad you want to create and click the green \"Create\" button to far left of these ad types, as shown below. You can see from this screenshot that we're currently set to create a new <strong>campaign</strong>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-manager.jpg?width=690&amp;name=facebook-ad-manager.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad manager create a new ad button\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Choose an objective.</h3> \n<p>Facebook's Ads Manager, like many social media advertising networks, is designed with your campaign objective in mind. Before getting started, Ads Manager will prompt you to choose an objective for your campaign:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-campaign-objective.jpg?width=690&amp;name=facebook-ad-campaign-objective.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad campaign objective\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p>There are 11 different objectives to choose from. The list includes everything from general brand awareness, to getting installs of your app, to increasing traffic to your online store.</p> \n<p>By choosing one of these objectives, you're giving Facebook a better idea of what you'd like to do so they can present you with the best-suited ad options. As shown in the screenshot above, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/post-engagement/photo/\">Facebook's ad options</a> include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Brand awareness</li> \n <li>Reach</li> \n <li>Website traffic</li> \n <li>Engagement</li> \n <li>App installs</li> \n <li>Video views</li> \n <li>Lead generation</li> \n <li>Messages</li> \n <li>Conversions</li> \n <li>Catalog sales</li> \n <li>Store traffic</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let's say, for sake of this blog post, you're looking to drive more traffic to your website. When you select this option, Facebook will prompt you to enter the URL you're looking to promote. If you're using marketing automation software, be sure to create <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht?_ga=2.179189668.12369809.1557758544-983944916.1546275206\">a unique tracking URL with UTM parameters</a> for this to ensure that you'll be able to keep track of traffic and conversions from this ad. For HubSpot customers, this can be done using the Tracking URL Builder.</p> \n<p>Once selected, Facebook will then display the ad option that makes the most sense in terms of achieving this objective.</p> \n<h3>4. Choose your audience.</h3> \n<p>Your next step is to configure your target audience -- you can do this for each ad set that belongs to the same campaign. If you're just starting out with paid advertising on Facebook, it's likely that you'll have to experiment with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-audience-insights-guide\">several different targeting options</a> until you reach an audience that fits just right.</p> \n<p>To help you narrow your focus, Facebook's targeting criteria are accompanied by an audience definition gauge. This tool -- located to the right of the audience targeting fields -- takes all of your selected properties into consideration in order to come up with a potential reach number.</p> \n<p>If you're wavering between choosing a specific audience over a broad one, consider your objective. If you're looking to drive traffic, you'll probably want to focus on the type of people you know will be interested in your offering. However, if you're looking to build brand awareness or promote a widely appealing offer, feel free to focus on a more general audience.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_10.23.53_AM.png?width=669&amp;height=621&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_10.23.53_AM.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"621\" alt=\"Audience creation page in the Facebook Ad Manager\"></p> \n<p>Facebook's built-in targeting is vast, including options such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Location</li> \n <li>Age</li> \n <li>Gender</li> \n <li>Languages</li> \n <li>Relationship</li> \n <li>Education</li> \n <li>Work</li> \n <li>Financial</li> \n <li>Home</li> \n <li>Ethnic Affinity</li> \n <li>Generation</li> \n <li>Parents</li> \n <li>Politics (U.S. only)</li> \n <li>Life Events</li> \n <li>Interests</li> \n <li>Behaviors</li> \n <li>Connections</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You also have the option to select a Custom Audience -- this allows you to <a href=\"https://mobilemonkey.com/blog/facebook-ads-hubspot-crm\">target people on Facebook who are in your company's contact database</a>, visited a page on your website that has a tracking pixel, or use your app or game. To learn more about how to set up a Custom Audience on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/170456843145568\">check out these instructions</a>. (And for more on the specifics of these criteria, visit <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/433385333434831\">this Facebook targeting resource</a>.)</p> \n<p>Once you find a group that responds well to your ads, Facebook allows you to save these audiences to be used again later -- so you may not need to dive into this step once you've been running Facebook ads for a while.</p> \n<h3>5. Set your budget.</h3> \n<p>Facebook allows you to set either a daily budget or a lifetime budget. Here's how they differ from each other:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Daily budget.</strong> If you want your ad set to run continuously throughout the day, this is the option you'll want to go for. Using a daily budget means that Facebook will pace your spending per day. Keep in mind that the minimum daily budget for an ad set is $1.00 USD and must be <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/560163334110364\">at least 2X your CPC</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>Lifetime budget.</strong> If you're looking to run your ad for a specified length of time, select lifetime budget. This means Facebook will pace your spend over the time period you set for the ad to run.</li> \n</ul> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-budget.jpg?width=502&amp;name=facebook-ad-budget.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad budget and schedule page\" width=\"502\"> \n<p>To further specify your budgeting, turn to the advanced options -- this option is linked at the bottom of the screenshot shown above. This section allows you to specify a few things:</p> \n<h4>Schedule</h4> \n<p>Choose whether or not your want your campaign to run immediately and continuously or if you want to customize the start and end dates. You can also set parameters so that your ads only run during specific hours and days of the week.</p> \n<h4>Optimization &amp; Pricing</h4> \n<p>Choose whether or not you want to bid for your objective, clicks, or impressions. (This will alter how your ad is displayed and paid for.) By doing so, you'll pay for your ad to be shown to people within your target audience that are more likely to complete your desired action, but Facebook will control what your maximum bid is.</p> \n<p>If you don't want Facebook to set optimal bids for you, you'll want to opt for manual bidding. This option awards you full control over how much you're willing to pay per action completed. However, Facebook will provide a suggested bid based on other advertisers' behavior to give you a sense of what you should shoot for.</p> \n<h4>Delivery</h4> \n<p>Delivery type falls under two categories: standard and accelerated. Standard delivery will show your ads throughout the day, while accelerated delivery helps you reach an audience quickly for time-sensitive ads (Note: this option requires manual bid pricing).</p> \n<h3>6. Create your ad.</h3> \n<p>What do you want your ad to look like? It all depends on your original objective.</p> \n<p>If you're looking to increase the number of clicks to your website, Facebook's Ad Manager will suggest the <strong>Clicks to Website</strong> ad options. Makes sense, right?</p> \n<p>This ad option is broken down into two formats: Links and Carousels. Essentially, this means that you can either display a single image ad (Links) or a multi-image ad (Carousel) with three to five scrolling images at no additional cost.</p> \n<p>A Links ad will be displayed like this:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Single_image.jpg?width=458&amp;height=345&amp;name=Single_image.jpg\" width=\"458\" height=\"345\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Facebook Ad with link to Shop Now\"></p> \n<p>A Carousel ad will be displayed like this:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Carosel_Ad.jpg?width=455&amp;height=285&amp;name=Carosel_Ad.jpg\" width=\"455\" height=\"285\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of a Facebook Carousel Ad with images of Grand Canyon\"></p> \n<p>Once you decide between the two, you'll need to upload your creative assets. It's important to note that for each type of ad, Facebook requires users to adhere to certain design criteria.</p> \n<p>For single image ads, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/image/facebook-feed/traffic\">Facebook asks that users adhere to the following design recommendations</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Text: 125 characters</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Ad Headline: 25 characters</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Image ratio: 1.91:1</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Image resolution (including CTA): 1080 x 1080 pixels</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For multi-image ads -- also known as Carousel Ads -- <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/clicks-to-website/carousel/\">Facebook provides the following design recommendations</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Recommended image size: 1080 x 1080 pixels</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Image ratio: 1:1</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Text: 125 characters</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Headline: 40 characters</li> \n <li class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">Link description: 20 characters</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"mbm _52if _3m9\">\n Your image may not include more than 20% text. \n <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/tools/text_overlay\">See how much text</a> is on your image.\n</div> \n<p><strong>Keep in mind that these are the ad options for the \"Traffic\" objective.</strong></p> \n<p>If you selected \"boost your posts,\" you'd be presented with different ad options like the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/post-engagement/photo/\">Page Post Engagement: Photo ad</a>. This ad has a unique set of design recommendations. To explore all of the ad options and their design specifics, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/clicks-to-website/links/?toggle0=Photo\">refer to this resource</a>.</p> \n<p>Once you select an ad type, the Ads Manager will prompt you to identify how you'd like to display your ad. The options they provide are as follows: Desktop News Feed, Mobile News Feed, and Desktop Right Column.</p> \n<p>Here's how each ad would appear:</p> \n<h4>Desktop News Feed</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.29_AM.png?width=438&amp;height=474&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.29_AM.png\" width=\"438\" height=\"474\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Facebook Ad with single image on a desktop news feed\"></p> \n<h4>Mobile News Feed</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/IMG_5234.png?width=360&amp;height=640&amp;name=IMG_5234.png\" width=\"360\" height=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Facebook ad with single image on mobile news feed\"></p> \n<h4>Desktop Right Column</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.03_AM.png?width=245&amp;height=233&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.03_AM.png\" width=\"245\" height=\"233\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Facebook Ad with single image on desktop right column\"></p> \n<p>Be aware if your ad isn't associated with a Facebook page, you'll only be able to run Desktop Right Column ads. To leverage all three display locations, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5492/How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Business-Page-in-5-Simple-Steps-With-Video.aspx?_ga=2.106969602.12369809.1557758544-983944916.1546275206\">learn how to create a Facebook Page here.</a></p> \n<h3>7. Monitor your ad's performance metrics.</h3> \n<p>Once your ads are running, you'll want to keep an eye on how they're doing. To see their results, you'll want to look in two places: the Facebook Ad Manager and your marketing software.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/510910008975690\">According to Facebook</a>, here are some of the key metrics to look for (and their definitions):</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Performance. </strong>Can be customized further to include metrics like results, reach, frequency and impressions</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Engagement.</strong> Can be customized further to include metrics like Page likes, Page engagement and post engagement</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Videos. </strong>Can be customized further to include metrics like video views and avg. % of video viewed</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Website.</strong> Can be customized further to include metrics like website actions (all), checkouts, payment details, purchases and adds to cart</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Apps.</strong> Can be further customized to include metrics like app installs, app engagement, credit spends, mobile app actions and cost per app engagement</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Events.</strong> Can be further customized to include metrics like event responses and cost per event response</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Clicks.</strong> Can be further customized to include metrics like clicks, unique clicks, CTR (click-through rate) and CPC (cost per click)</li> \n <li class=\"fcb\"><strong>Settings. </strong>Can be further customized to include metrics like start date, end date, ad set name, ad ID, delivery, bid and objective</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Regardless of which of these metrics you use to measure the success of your advertising efforts, you can find the data in the Ads Manager.</p> \n<p>As you analyze, you'll be thinking about your data in four main ways, depending on how granular you need to get:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The account level</li> \n <li>The campaign level</li> \n <li>The ad set level</li> \n <li>The ad level</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>The Account Level</h4> \n<p>This gives a high-level view of performance across all campaigns. You'll find aggregate data that gives you a bird's eye view.</p> \n<p>Simply navigate to the ads manager and click Account Overview. From there, you'll be able to customize the metrics you want to see drill down time ranges, and more.</p> \n<h4>The Campaign, Ad Set, or Ad Level</h4> \n<p>You can also get far more specific with your analysis by checking the performance of campaigns and even down to individual ads. This can help you figure out which messaging, audiences, and collateral are resonating the best.</p> \n<p>All you have to do is navigate to the Campaigns, Ad Sets, or Ads tabs next to Account Overview in the ads manager.</p> \n<h3>8. Reporting on Facebook ad performance.</h3> \n<p>You can receive custom reports via email as well. Here's how to set it up:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Navigate to Analyze and Report through the upper main menu.</li> \n <li>Choose Ads Reporting.</li> \n <li>Select Create Custom Report.</li> \n <li>Select and open a saved report.</li> \n <li>Choose Save As next to the save icon. Give your report a name and check Schedule Email.</li> \n <li>Follow the prompts to edit and confirm your reporting preferences.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>While there are certainly a lot of details to keep straight when planning a paid Facebook ad, it's important that you don't lose sight of the big picture. Reporting on clicks and conversions from Facebook is important. However, if you're using URLs with specific UTM codes, you have an opportunity to measure your ads' full-funnel effectiveness <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/analytics?_ga=2.115217543.12369809.1557758544-983944916.1546275206\">using your marketing software</a>.</p> \n<p>Tracking URLs will help your marketing software keep track of how many leads, or better yet, how many customers you've gained from your advertising efforts. This information is useful in determining the ROI of this source, and can also be used to inform your overall <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing\">Facebook marketing</a> strategy.</p> \n<p>If you're a HubSpot customer using <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ads\">our ads tool</a>, this process is already taken care of for you. You can also create unique tracking codes for your Facebook campaign by navigating to the Tracking URL Builder on the Reports Home page. All you'll need to do is plug in the URL, attach a campaign, and choose the source you want the URL to be attributed to in your Sources Report. Once your ad launches and you start getting traffic and conversions on your website, you'll be able to easily track how many visits, contacts, and customers you're generating.</p> \n<p>Now that you know how to set up an ad, it's time to create one of your own so that you can spread brand awareness on Facebook and generate traffic and leads from your ideal prospects on the platform.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in September 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\"> </a>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffacebook-paid-ad-checklist&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7da78fe7e04abd3c09154b96f6511d22","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"cstec@hubspot.com (Carly Stec)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-manager.jpg?width=690&name=facebook-ad-manager.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn90@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-24-161_b6d43be6282fa9b9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-campaign-objective.jpg?width=690&name=facebook-ad-campaign-objective.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-23-312_505d2e974475965f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_10.23.53_AM.png?width=669&height=621&name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_10.23.53_AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-24-416_ef81255a8708ece5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-ad-budget.jpg?width=502&name=facebook-ad-budget.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-24-419_b9700d68bd14da9a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Single_image.jpg?width=458&height=345&name=Single_image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn32@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-28-894_7449b70bc6a0597f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Carosel_Ad.jpg?width=455&height=285&name=Carosel_Ad.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-21-900_002beeaaaf098a6c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.29_AM.png?width=438&height=474&name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.29_AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-23-335_dadb51b69530e9ac.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/IMG_5234.png?width=360&height=640&name=IMG_5234.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn21@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-26-945_b2805a4958eee8f0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.03_AM.png?width=245&height=233&name=Screen_Shot_2015-08-20_at_11.29.03_AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn66@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-28-281_ee71dfad7778e461.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffacebook-paid-ad-checklist&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-26-392_47375d84c907c6e4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336428},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"A Content Marketing Playbook for Times of Crisis","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-playbook-for-times-of-crisis","description":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has sent businesses scrambling to pause plans, edit emails, and cancel campaigns. And while everybody seems to know what <em>not</em> to publish these days, many marketers are asking: what <em>should</em> we put out into a world in the throes of a crisis?</p>  \n<p>It's a conundrum facing countless creators across the globe.</p> \n<p>They're wondering how to be empathetic without being disingenuous. How to offer value without seeming opportunistic. And how to be there for their audience without adding to the noise.</p> \n<p>These are important questions to ask at a time like this. Essential, in fact. But underpinning all of them is a much simpler question that gets to the very heart of what content marketing has always been about. A question that every creator staring at a blank canvas right now should be asking: <em>how can we help?</em></p> \n<p>Because now, more than ever before, audiences are seeking help.</p> \n<h2><span>Increasing Engagement Rates</span></h2> \n<p>Entire industries have been forced into hibernation in recent weeks, but this does not mean audiences' appetites for helpful content has gone away. On the contrary. Consumers are increasing searches for valuable information and engaging with businesses at record rates.</p> \n<p>According to an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-edition3\">analysis of anonymized data from HubSpot's global customer base</a>, engagement with marketing emails, website traffic, and live chat sessions have all been on the rise, with email open rates an eye-catching 25% higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png?width=1500&amp;name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png\" alt=\"increasing engagement rates\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Meanwhile, traffic to <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Academy</a>, our free online training program, has more than doubled in recent weeks, and our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing\">Marketing Blog</a> has experienced a 40% increase in weekly organic traffic.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has triggered a striking surge in the very thing that many marketers care about most: audience attention. And such a high level of interest in the content companies are sharing, coming at such a sensitive time, places a huge responsibility on marketers to deliver materials that are not only relevant to the current moment, but genuinely impactful, too.</p> \n<p>Those that fall short run the risk of doing damage to their reputation — according to <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/research/covid-19-brand-trust-report\">Edelman</a>, \"71 percent of consumers agree that if they perceive that a brand is putting profit over people, they will lose trust in that brand forever.\"</p> \n<p>But those that succeed will leave a lasting impression on their audience — according to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/adapt-the-marketing-strategy-for-covid-19\">Gartner</a>, brands that meet consumer's needs at this time can \"re-establish trust through customer-centric actions.\"</p> \n<p>So, it is not only engagement rates that are high during this crisis. The stakes are high, too. And a situation this unique requires a unique strategy to match.</p> \n<h2>When a Crisis Descends, Pause Before Planning</h2> \n<p>When times of crisis strike, the first thing marketers should think about is what <em>not</em> to do. Planned projects, campaigns, and announcements should be reviewed and postponed if possible. For those assets that are released as planned, it's likely they'll need a new tone that's appropriate for the new environment.</p> \n<p>Marketers should examine every article, email, ad, and social media post scheduled to be published to ensure that the tone of each asset is empathetic and respectful.</p> \n<p>If this sounds like a lot of work, it's because, in many cases, it is. No one team can manage a company-wide content audit alone.</p> \n<p>Communications teams have expertise in developing messaging, social media teams have deep connections to their online community, email marketing teams have a strong understanding of brand tone, and customer-facing teams, including sales to service, have their fingers on the pulse of how customers are feeling — all of these teams should be consulted on content strategy during a crisis to ensure that a consistent and helpful approach is adopted across every touchpoint with the public.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, before we began creating new content for the new environment, we significantly reduced the frequency of our social media posting, dialed back the promotion of a major product launch (<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">CMS Hub</a>), and created a centralized set of guidelines on how we as a company should be communicating during this crisis.</p> \n<p>Making such sweeping adjustments on short notice isn't simple, but for us, two things helped make it easier.</p> \n<p>First, we have an established decision-making process for crisis communications that minimizes confusion in the moment.</p> \n<p>Second, by centralizing all of our customer interactions in a shared CRM, we're able to see what communications customers are getting and roll out adjustments quickly to marketing, sales, and service.</p> \n<h2>Creating New Content in Times of Crisis</h2> \n<p>When it comes to creating new content during a crisis, marketers' sole focus should be on delivering work that is genuinely helpful to their audience, without being opportunistic or adding more noise to a topic that has already been widely covered by others.</p> \n<p>According to research conducted by <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/research/covid-19-brand-trust-report\">Edelman</a>, 85% of people expect companies to use their power to educate their audiences during the COVID-19 crisis. For some companies, that could mean writing in-depth articles that offer expert advice on relevant topics or aggregating publicly available information to make it more accessible for readers.</p> \n<p>Intuit, for example, did this well when they teamed up with GoFundMe to create a <a href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com/small-business/coronavirus/\">Small Business Relief Initiative</a> and when they built an <a href=\"https://aidassist.intuit.com/app/home#/home\">interactive tool</a> to help small businesses learn if they are eligible for government-provided financial relief.</p> \n<p>We saw similarly helpful content from Care.com, whose team leveraged their deep knowledge of caregiving best practices to share <a href=\"https://www.care.com/c/stories/16747/navigating-covid-19-care/\">expert advice</a> on the precautions for families and caregivers facing the global health crisis.</p> \n<p>These powerful examples directly address the situation at hand. But for other companies, providing helpful content could mean offering an alternative to the cacophony of crisis-centric content flooding feeds all day, every day.</p> \n<p>For example, NPR has unsurprisingly witnessed a spike in listenership to its news shows as people seek up-to-date, reliable information as the pandemic evolves. But it has also seen a 120% increase in weekly visits to its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/\">Tiny Desk Concerts</a> — an entertainment series — indicating that audiences are not only interested in information directly about the crisis, but are also desiring content that provides an escape from it.</p> \n<p>This should make content marketers feel encouraged.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>It suggests that help can take many forms in the midst of a crisis and that there are multiple ways creators can add value to the lives of their audiences at this time.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For marketing teams that don't have the necessary resources to create new content given the trying economic environment, there are still creative ways to adapt to audiences' needs. Gathering together old content that's relevant to the current situation, updating it as needed, and presenting it as an easily digestible ebook or content series can be efficient ways of overcoming resource shortages.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we did just this when we published <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/topic-learning-path/remote-work\">a new landing page featuring all of our articles about remote work</a> to offer some timely support to companies and employees adjusting to the new normal of working from home.</p> \n<p>During times of crisis, there are a number of ways for marketers to approach new content creation — some that directly address the unique environment at hand, others that look to complement the new patterns of behavior that are emerging — but the one thing that should be consistent is an honest effort to help.</p> \n<h2>Choose Channels Carefully, Distribute Delicately</h2> \n<p>Marketers have an abundance of options for how they distribute their work, but just because we <em>can</em> publish content on multiple channels doesn't always mean that we <em>should</em>.</p> \n<p>Our research tells us that marketing email send volumes have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-edition4\">increased significantly in recent weeks</a>, meaning that subscribers' email inboxes are even busier than usual. As well-intentioned as a new article or video might be, if it isn't distributed delicately and at a considerate cadence, it could end up doing more harm than good in a company's efforts to help audience members.</p> \n<p>Marketers should reserve their most intimate communications channels, like email and push notifications, for key content updates during a crisis and adopt more subtle distribution approaches for their more niche materials.</p> \n<p>For example, an SEO-optimized article that's easily discoverable through search may be a more appropriate way to share certain new content offerings than a direct email or paid social media post, both of which could come across as excessively promotional or tone-deaf.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, when the pandemic was declared, we cut our social media posting by approximately 50% in the first week and reduced the number of ads we were sending to avoid overloading our audience with information at a time when there's already a lot to process.</p> \n<p>And when we developed a new educational content series, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/adapt2020\">Adapt 2020</a>, we made clear to potential subscribers what type of content to expect, as well as where and when it would be distributed.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png\" alt=\"content marketing adapt 2020 campaign\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>The Adapt series became the cornerstone of our content strategy during the current crisis and provided a powerful proof point of the value of the diverse app ecosystem that's deeply integrated with HubSpot's suite of tools.</p> \n<p>With Looker we've been able to share regular updates on shifting trends in sales and marketing, with Canva we've been able to quickly design on-brand assets to promote upcoming webinars, and with Slack we've been able to collaborate with confidence on all of the elements that make up the weekly content series.</p> \n<p>With distribution channels and cadence established with our subscribers, we have been able to turn our attention towards monitoring how the crisis and the needs of our audience are evolving from week to week.</p> \n<h2>Adapt Early, Adapt Often</h2> \n<p>Crises are unpredictable by nature. And what was deeply valuable to audiences last week, may be irrelevant by the next. To provide helpful content for the duration of a crisis, marketers should prepare to continually evolve their strategy in line with their audiences' shifting needs.</p> \n<p>Choosing the right metrics to monitor is key to not falling behind the pace of change. Creators should closely monitor metrics that indicate engagement — such as 'average time spent on page' for articles and show-up rates for webinars — to gain an insight into whether or not their new content is resonating with audiences. And from there, they can use those learnings to look for ways to improve the relevance and helpfulness of their next offering.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we initially focused on delivering content aimed at helping businesses to set up virtual events and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/topic-learning-path/remote-work\">adapt to the new normal of remote work</a>.</p> \n<p>We then quickly shifted focus to creating content to help businesses take advantage of new relief measures available by publishing the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/en-us/coronavirus-response\">pricing and packaging changes we've made</a> along with an<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/us-stimulus-package\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/us-stimulus-package\">overview of the U.S. Stimulus Package</a>.</p> \n<p>Following that, we shifted focus to creating content to help businesses adjust their medium- and longer-term strategies and prepare for the post-pandemic economy.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>We have never witnessed such sudden and dramatic shifts in what audiences need, and the marketers that are nimble enough to adapt their strategy quickly are the ones most likely to provide meaningful help for the duration of the crisis at hand.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And by doing so, they stand to establish long-lasting levels of loyalty with their audience.</p> \n<h2>What Content Marketing Has Always Been About</h2> \n<p>It's no secret that consumers' trust in companies has been dwindling in recent years. According to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-acquisition-study\">HubSpot Research</a>, 55% of people no longer trust the companies they buy from as much as they used to, and 71% do not trust sponsored ads on social networks.</p> \n<p>However, times of crisis create unique environments and unexpected outcomes, one of which can be the recovery of some of that lost trust, and the deepening of long-term relationships between consumers and companies.</p> \n<p>Audiences are turning in record numbers to businesses for resources, information, and support. Customers are taking to social media to rally support for their favorite businesses. And content marketers are returning to first principles and re-establishing helpfulness at the heart of their strategies.</p> \n<p>There are many challenges facing businesses at this time — content strategy is just one of them — but I am hopeful that marketers adopting the advice outlined here will see their efforts rewarded in the form of closer relationships with the audiences, and the fulfillment of knowing they've provided help when it's been needed the most.</p> \n<p>After all, that's what content marketing has always been about.</p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcontent-marketing-playbook-for-times-of-crisis&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c5760aa0fc813a19a26af70839ac7c61","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"manderson@hubspot.com (Meghan Keaney Anderson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png?width=1500&name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-23-725_b3f407fe1f42c77d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png?width=1500&name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn12@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-24-001_3fae8f649b5c442c.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcontent-marketing-playbook-for-times-of-crisis&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn10@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-25-237_d469ddd1ee8ae4cd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336431},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"What Is Phishing and How Can You Protect Your Business From an Attack?","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-phishing","description":"<p>Staff at MacEwan University, a school in Edmonton, Canada, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/macewan-university-phishing-scam-edmonton-1.4270689\">received an email</a> from a major vendor stating they had recently changed their electronic banking information and needed payments to be sent to a new account.</p>  \n<p>Assuming their trusted business partner was just going through some changes, the university complied and transferred three payments to the new bank account within a span of 10 days.</p>  \n<p>But four days later, MacEwan University received a phone call from this same vendor asking them why they hadn't paid their fees yet. Perplexed by the call, the university told them they had just transferred the payments to their new bank account.</p> \n<p>The vendor had no idea what they were talking about.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, this bank account didn’t actually belong to MacEwan’s vendor. It belonged to cyber criminals in Canada and Hong Kong. And MacEwan University had just transferred them $11.8 million.</p> \n<p>Eventually, the university discovered the email requesting them to transfer their payments to the new bank account was actually fraudulent and a prevalent form of cyber attack that <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/gtd-pfpt-uk-tr-state-of-the-phish-2020-a4_final.pdf\">thousands of businesses</a> fall victim to every year — phishing.</p> Examples of these credentials include passwords, credit card details, bank login information, and social security numbers. \n<p>Most cyber criminals deploy phishing attacks through email, like the picture below, but some have also started to exploit social media, messaging apps, and text message to steal people’s personal information.</p> Phishing instances have rose in number over recent years — in fact, there were over over \n<a href=\"https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q1_2020.pdf\">60,000 phishing sites reported in March of 2020 alone</a>. This cybercrime could wreak havoc on your brand and bottom line. \n<p>So how do you defend your customers and employees from phishing without making them your brand’s first line of defense?</p> \n<p>Here are three shields you can leverage to protect your brand from these prevalent attacks.</p> \n<h2>How to Protect Your Business From Phishing Attacks</h2> \n<h3>1. Build a DMARC record.</h3> \n<p>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance) is a cutting-edge email authentication protocol that leverages two other authentication protocols, SPF (Sender Policy Framework), and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) to verify legitimate messages sent from your domain and block fraudulent emails that <em>appear</em> to be sent from your domain.</p> \n<p>These email authentication protocols are rather technical, so in a nutshell, SPF is a record of IP addresses that are authorized to send emails on your behalf that email service providers check against, and DKIM is a verification process that leverages cryptographic authentication.</p> \n<p>DMARC is the only technology that can ensure your \"header from” address (what your users usually look at first when they see your emails) is trustworthy.</p> \n<p>To do this, they’ll only authenticate email messages that pass SPF authentication and SPF alignment or DKIM authentication and alignment. If an email message fails SPF authentication or alignment and DKIM authentication or alignment, it’ll fail DMARC.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-19%20at%209.07.34%20AM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-08-19%20at%209.07.34%20AM.png\" alt=\"how dmarc works when protecting against phishing\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"http://rejoiner.com/resources/email-authentication/\"><em>Source</em></a></p> \n<p>DMARC also allows you to tell email service providers what they should do with any fraudulent mail that appears to be sent from your domain. You can either monitor all of your emails, move unauthenticated messages to users’ spam folders, or decide not to deliver this type of mail at all to inboxes on your server.</p> \n<p>Additionally, email service providers will regularly send you forensic DMARC reports, showing you which emails are authenticating, which ones are not, and why.</p> \n<h3>2. Train customers and employees to spot an attack.</h3> \n<p>According to PhishMe, a phishing defense solution, companies who train employees to identify and report attempted phishing attacks only have a <a href=\"https://phishme.com/phishing-resiliency-%20report-2017/\">5% susceptibility rate to phishing.</a></p> \n<p>To help employees and customers spot one of these attacks and better defend your business, teach them these common phishing markers:</p> \n<h4>Poor Spelling, Grammar, or Writing</h4> \n<p>A lot of amateur cyber criminals don’t take the time to craft clear and convincing emails, which brands always seem to do, and foreign cyber criminals will usually rely on Google Translate to translate their messages. So if you receive a poorly written email from a seemingly legitimate sender, take caution.</p> \n<h4>Suspicious URLs</h4> \n<p>Most phishing emails lure people into clicking through to a malicious or fake website. To do this, cyber criminals will usually spoof the website’s URL by creating a lookalike one, or they’ll mask their dodgy URL by shortening it.</p> \n<p>Whenever you see a weird or shortened URL, make sure you hover your mouse over it to see if the landing page’s web address is different or fake.</p> \n<h4>Mismatched Sender Address</h4> \n<p>Even if a cyber criminal can perfectly imitate your brand’s voice, formatting, logo, address, and contact email address in their phishing email, there’s still a trait of yours they can’t copy — your sender address.</p> \n<p>Cyber criminals will usually create a lookalike sender address or just use a string of characters in hopes that you won’t check it. To verify a brand’s sender address, check out the sender’s domain in the email’s “from” header and see if it matches the brand’s domain.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 500;\">3. Invest in email security software.</span></p> \n<p>If your company has the funds, email security software like <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/solutions/email-fraud\">Proofpoint</a> and <a href=\"https://www.barracuda.com/products/totalemailprotection\">Barracuda</a> are the most reliable and effective lines of defense against phishing.</p> \n<p>Well-versed employees can still fall victim to cleverly-crafted phishing emails and cyber criminals constantly refine their malicious tactics, like sending phishing emails from the legitimate domains of compromised websites.</p> \n<p>But since email security software can identify unusual traffic patterns and monitor fishy URLs, it can effectively detect, block, and respond to these sophisticated threats before they reach your customers and employees’ inbox.</p> \n<h2>Avoid Getting Snagged</h2> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">Arm yourself with DMARC, thorough employee training, and the best-fit email security software for your specific systems and situation, to shield your customers, employees, and brand from phishing attacks — no matter how enticing the bait is.</span></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in December, 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HsfbPqtSPNa55Y5Mz65rjvNfaGjEb01shhbiZuCRq1IdlV-gvoTp6VejmS7sbMatYgOinlWNdMXqIWFZKSM46oIpLkCzxWm8FYkKFuTiUQvN1bSoSEvfJpfdPOrPhvXo9y5s6iS7\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 500;\"> </span>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-phishing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"794a23c8f2e7708ff4b01d92f26fe513","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-19%20at%209.07.34%20AM.png?width=1500&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-08-19%20at%209.07.34%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn93@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-29-364_037fd73bb681908b.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HsfbPqtSPNa55Y5Mz65rjvNfaGjEb01shhbiZuCRq1IdlV-gvoTp6VejmS7sbMatYgOinlWNdMXqIWFZKSM46oIpLkCzxWm8FYkKFuTiUQvN1bSoSEvfJpfdPOrPhvXo9y5s6iS7":null,"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-phishing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn77@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-27-624_6507597db9e875da.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336423},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"12 Social Media Tools You Need to Use in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-tools","description":"<p>You already know how important <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/social-media?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=social_media\">social media </a>is to increase brand awareness, generate more leads, and ultimately score more conversions.</p> \n<p>The world is on social media — <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/pages/digital-2020\">50% of it</a>, at least — so if you want your product, service, and mission to reach the maximum amount of people, your business needs to be on social media, too.</p>  \n<p>Social media, however, can be extremely time-consuming. Additionally, it spans so many diverse tasks, ranging from number-based activities like tracking analytics, to creative jobs such as designing graphics.</p> \n<p>It can be difficult to find the skills and manpower needed to execute a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing?_ga=2.148338675.551210183.1559051592-1451183703.1557949920\">good social media strategy</a> — which is why you need social media tools to help you out.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll cover the top 12 <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/social-media-management/\">social media tools</a> you should be using in 2020 to help you save time and increase conversions.</p> \n<h2>What makes for a good social media tool?</h2> \n<p>Although the term \"social media tool\" is very general and can apply to a wide range of services, there are a few key features each social media tool should have.</p> \n<h3>1. It saves you time.</h3> \n<p>The goal of a social media tool is to save you time while getting similar — or better — results than you could without it. Look for social media tools that automate a process, but make sure the process still happens correctly, since some shortcuts might be too fast and therefore won't focus on quality.</p> \n<h3>2. It helps you increase brand awareness.</h3> \n<p>One of the biggest benefits of social media is its ability to increase your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">brand awareness</a>, which is why each social media tool you select should perform its services with brand awareness in mind.</p> \n<p>Maybe your tool of choice is an editing platform such as <a href=\"http://lightroom.com\">Lightroom</a>, which can help you create images to match the rest of your feed. Or, maybe it's an Instagram scheduler like <a href=\"http://later.com\">Later</a> so you can preview your profile before you post images. Whatever the case may be, social media tools should focus largely on brand awareness.</p> \n<h3>3. It's easy to use.</h3> \n<p>Social media tools are only a time-saver if they're easy and intuitive. Each tool you select should be super user-friendly so that, if needed, your accounting team could edit photos and your creative, right-brained writers could still use the analytics function to track daily social metrics.</p> \n<p>Many social media tools provide tutorials on their websites. Others, such as <a href=\"http://Kicksta.com\">Kicksta</a>, have top-notch customer service so you can get immediate expert advice if you need help getting off the ground.</p> \n<h3>4. It's affordable.</h3> \n<p>Social media tools should be affordable (and most of them are). Many high-quality social media tools are even free, such as the <a href=\"https://unfold.com/\">Unfold</a> app, which is perfect for creating Instagram stories.</p> \n<p>With social media tools, there's no need for you to go back and forth with the accounting department trying to get your budget approved. Most social media tools are already budget-friendly so all you need to do is sign up.</p> \n<h3>5. It keeps you organized.</h3> \n<p>One of the ways social media tools save you time is by keeping you organized, so make sure the social media tools you decide to use are efficient and tidy.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox\">HubSpot's Social Inbox tool </a>helps you prioritize your social media interactions, and graphic design website <a href=\"http://canva.com\">Canva</a> saves your designs so you can go back and edit them later.</p> \n<h3>1.

If you're like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?__hstc=20629287.baf2406400c73bbe46641b2b9cd8a38f.1563824949326.1584540014200.1584545281370.484&amp;__hssc=20629287.18.1584545281370&amp;__hsfp=3755920611\">almost half of marketers</a>, your answer probably includes ad placement and targeting.</p>  \n<p>As we know, targeted ads are used to find the most qualified leads by showing audiences content that's relevant to them.</p> \n<p>Targeted ads connect you with the leads that are going to be the most interested in what you offer.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>So, how can you be sure that you're generating the <em>most </em>qualified leads with your targeted ads? While there's no sure fire way to tell, there's an optimization strategy you may be missing: behavioral targeting.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/audience-targeting-blog?_ga=2.187036584.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">Targeted advertising</a> allows you to use demographic information, including location or age, to surface ads to relevant audiences. Behavioral targeting uses web behavior as the determining factor, instead of demographics. This increases the impact ads have on audiences.</p> \n<p>Some of the criteria behavioral targeting looks at includes previously visited websites, search history, and past purchases.</p> \n<p>If a marketer spent 20 minutes browsing CRMs, Googling software prices, and reading customer management blogs, behavioral targeting would analyze those actions to show that person ads for a CRM product the next time they visited a site like Facebook.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting is used to improve campaign effectiveness. The sales manager weighing their CRM options would likely be more interested in a product ad for one rather than an SEO strategist, making them a qualified lead for the software company.</p> \n<p>Now, let's talk about how behavioral targeting can boost sales. If I were in the market for a social media scheduler and browsed websites like <a href=\"https://www.loomly.com/\">Loomly</a> and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\">Sprout Social</a> before turning to Google, the search engine's behavioral targeting features would show me ads for the sites I visited first.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences.png\" alt=\"a SERP that indicates previous web activity.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>My previous internet behavior told Google what type of sites I'd already visited, so the search engine pulled the top list of options that are related and relevant to my search. And, when I checked my Facebook account a little while later, I saw that my web behavior influenced my ads there, as well:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Behavioral%20Targeting%20Gets%20Your%20Content%20Seen%20By%20the%20Right%20Audiences-2.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"An ad being shown based on behavioral targeting.\">\n</div> \n<p>Pretty cool, right? And to run behavioral targeted ads, you wouldn't have to stray too far from your ad strategy. If your ad host offers targeted options, like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/ad-targeting\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising/targeting.html\">Twitter</a> do, create audience segments based on demographics, like location and age. You can also choose psychographics, like interests and values.</p> \n<p>After that, the software will do the work, choosing browsers to show your content based on the preferences you set.</p> \n<p>So, now we know that behavioral targeting helps reach those leads who are intending to make purchases. But what about the potential customers who are in a different stage of their journey?</p> \n<p>Enter: predictive behavioral targeting.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting uses website history to show users ads that relate to their interests. Predictive behavioral targeting is a form of analysis — it looks at those targeted ads as a whole, so advertisers can come to conclusions about audience interaction.</p> \n<p>For instance, this is a behavioral targeted ad I came across on Facebook. If I, and others with similar demographics, interact with the ad in the same way, WordStream's advertisers can infer that audiences like me respond well to similar content offer ads.</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwordstream%2Fposts%2F10158788220547743&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=400&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>Predictive behavioral targeting helps improve the performance of ads for audience segments. It lets advertisers look critically at the similarities of customers and cater to them. This improves the effectiveness of behaviors being targeted.</p> \n<p>If you're still on the fence about using this strategy, don't worry. Let's look at the good and bad of behavioral targeting to help you make your decision.</p> \n<h2>Pros and Cons of Behavioral Targeting</h2> \n<p>There are a <em>lot </em>of ad types to choose from, and it's up to advertisers to choose ones that maximize the effectiveness of campaigns. Like with all types, behavioral targeting has its upsides and downsides. Let's look at a few.</p> \n<h3>Behavioral targeting pros</h3> \n<h4>1. Nurture leads through the buyer's journey.</h4> \n<p>Behavioral targeting helps you fill in the gaps you may have with your ad strategy. If you're seeing excellent <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi?_ga=2.14572471.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">ROI</a> from brand awareness ads, but want to drive more conversions from content offer ads, behavioral targeting can help.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're using an ad to promote a new webinar you've hosted, turning on behavioral targeting will increase the ad's chance of reaching audiences who have been looking for webinars like yours.</p> \n<h4>2. Make more sales.</h4> \n<p>Behavioral targeting makes retargeting a better experience for customers. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide?_ga=2.14572471.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">Retargeted ads</a> catch website visitors who have abandoned your site without making a purchase. Behavioral retargeting takes that up a notch by crawling more previous web visits.</p> \n<p>When you use behavioral retargeting, your ads will convey a more personalized message to audiences. They’ll remind those who closed your site to visit again with content that's already tailored to their interests.</p> \n<h4>3. Improve the overall customer experience.</h4> \n<p>When you analyze behavioral targeting results, you can begin to draw conclusions about how your audience engages with ads. For instance, if you find that millennial customers are looking for a certain product stack, you can start tailoring your ads in response.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting shows customers data-driven ads based on their web behavior. Based on the data you collect from the ads, like click-through rate and conversions, you can tweak the messaging or content of those ads to fit the browsing patterns of your audience.</p> \n<h3>Behavioral targeting cons</h3> \n<h4>1. Behavioral targeting can get costly.</h4> \n<p>Running<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"> pay-per-click ads</a> isn't the most budget-friendly solution. Behavioral targeting falls under that umbrella, and it can get expensive. Make sure to check your advertising budget — and set budget caps — to make sure you have the financial bandwidth to produce ads for the entire campaign.</p> \n<h4>2. Ads can fail without proper audience knowledge.</h4> \n<p>If you don't know your audience, it's likely behavioral targeting won't give you positive results. Generally, the ads are shown based on audience segments you select. But, without proper knowledge of what customers respond to, there's room for lack of resonance from your target market.</p> \n<p>For instance, your buyer persona may be a 30-year-old marketer who's looking for a CRM to make the team she manages more organized. So, you decide to show that portion of your audience a brand awareness ad.</p> \n<p>But, if that ads messaging fails to capture the interest of the majority of your target audience, it won't be very effective. Behavioral targeting finds the right customers, but it's up to your ad to seal the deal. Make sure you're up-to-date with how your target market responds to ads to improve performance.</p> \n<h4>3. Behavioral targeting can lead to an advertising overload.</h4> \n<p>Be wary of producing too many. They can lead to an oversaturation of content and ultimately deter customers from wanting to engage with your ads. As a consumer, if I'm presented with numerous targeted ads from the same companies, I begin to mentally block out any advertising messages from that business.</p> \n<p>Use behavioral targeting sparingly. It'll save you money and catch customers at the right time. Be sure to modify your ad settings so you're not showing users targeted ads every five minutes, just which it's the most impactful.</p> \n<p>Behavioral targeting is just one of the many <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/optimizing-ads-hubspot\">a</a><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/optimizing-ads-hubspot?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">dvertising optimization strategies</a> that are great for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?_ga=2.15081142.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">generating leads</a>. It's also one of the most effective.

Sometimes projects gather a few links and then vanish under a pile of other content.</p> \n<p>To compete, you have to ensure the content you're creating, from the idea to the actual execution, is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/how-to-generate-effective-content-ideas\">compelling</a> enough to earn the coverage and attention you hope it'll achieve.</p> \n<p>And there's one really excellent way to do this: involve a digital PR specialist from the get-go.</p> \n<p>I work in digital PR and have consulted on hundreds of content projects.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review what I've learned about how content creators and digital PR professionals can successfully work together to create engaging, newsworthy content.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Recognize viral ideas.</h3> \n<p>Digital PR specialists are responsible for interacting and building relationships with the media, so they likely spend around 70% of their workday online.</p> \n<p>Typically, they're reading new studies, picking apart articles, and getting to know writers. It's only natural that after experiencing the nuances of the news cycle, PR specialists are able to recognize which ideas make it big.</p> \n<p>If that kind of market research already exists in the brains of the outreach specialists on your team, why not utilize it?</p> \n<p>Getting feedback from the birth of a project means the trajectory of the content will be aimed for top-tier coverage. From the idea stage, it may make sense to create a ranking system with your team.</p> \n<p>Outreach specialists can categorize each idea by newsworthiness, relevance, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-promotion-ideas\">promotional viability</a> to get a better understanding of where your projects stand.</p> \n<p>From there, you can go back to the drawing board or work with your best concepts.</p> \n<p>Using your PR pros will help expand creative ideas from using only what the creative team thinks is interesting to using what publishers think is interesting. Who knows? A single tip from an outreach specialist could turn a mediocre campaign into a huge win for a client.</p> \n<p>For example, at <a href=\"https://www.frac.tl/\">Fractl</a>, one of our biggest recent wins in the career vertical involved pivoting an idea about millennial work/life balance to a survey packed with \"would you rather\" questions.</p> \n<p>This new formatting allowed the creative strategist to ask more hard-hitting questions and challenged millennials to give concrete information about how much they'd be willing to sacrifice in their personal lives in order to get ahead in business. Some of the notable takeaways included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>More than two in five millennials are willing to end a relationship if it meant getting a promotion at work.</li> \n <li>One in three would dump their S.O. for a raise.</li> \n <li>Millennials put their career before marriage: most are willing to postpone marriage for another seven years if it means they'd land a promotion.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Keep data human.</h3> \n<p>In a recent study from <a href=\"https://www.buzzstream.com/blog/creating-the-most-authoritative-content.html\">BuzzStream and Fractl</a>, consumers ranked data analysis and index as the most authoritative form of online content.</p> \n<p>Those who work in content production are exceptional at analyzing these numbers to reveal their hidden insights. However, it can be easy to get lost in the data while exploring every perspective and lose sight of the most compelling pieces.</p> \n<p>Outreach specialists can help bridge the gap between data and human interest. If there isn't a cohesive narrative weaved throughout your data, a digital PR specialist can pull from their experience in studying what kind of stories emotionally resonate, and can help identify the true story in the data.</p> \n<p>While analyzing data, touch base with your outreach team to develop a storyline. Be sure they identify the simplest ways to digest the information you're trying to get across. If it takes longer than 60 seconds to understand the information in a graph, you're going to lose your audience.</p> \n<p>Oftentimes, content creators become attached to their data and believe every aspect is essential to the piece. While this may be true in some cases, oftentimes slimming down excess information can be beneficial to the narrative as a whole.</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid of feedback, and remember that outreach specialists spend <em>a lot</em> of time dissecting stories online. They're likely a trustworthy editor for your work.</p> \n<p>For example, when presenting repetitive information, it's important to provide interesting visuals to accompany data. When creating infographics about dangerous tools for a home improvement client, our team at Fractl decided to spice up statistics that would otherwise be mundane by placing the information within a tool shed.</p> \n<p>This project ended up being a winner within the home and garden vertical and I owe the promotional viability to the engaging way the information was presented.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png?width=600&amp;name=%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png\" alt=\"Infographic helps humanize data.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>If your data tells a story your audience wants to hear, graphs and images become as essential as the words on the page. Using industry knowledge from your outreach specialist's tool belt, you can elevate data-driven content to make it worthy of top-tier press.</p> \n<h3>3. Extract the juiciest takeaways.</h3> \n<p>You have a great idea, you research it, pull all the data, and it falls flat. Sometimes the stories you thought would be told through data don't come to fruition. But this doesn't mean your project is DOA, your outreach specialist may be able to revive it.</p> \n<p>Having an eye on the media means that outreach specialists may be able to extract something from a project that would have otherwise been overlooked. Digital PR pros can draw up some ideal headlines or takeaways to increase the project's chances of appealing to particular publishers and audiences.</p> \n<p>Whether it means tying the data to a trending story or pitching a vertical not initially intended to be a match for your content, there's usually always a way to distill data into a highly promotable headline.</p> \n<p>Chris Lewis, account manager and creative strategist at Fractl, said he incorporates feedback from media specialists into his projects.</p> \n<p>\"Outreach specialists are my secret weapon in creating compelling data-driven story content,\" he said. \"More than anything, they help me get out of my own way by always finding the promotable and most interesting parts of content and finding ways to highlight them.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Create better content.</h3> \n<p>Incorporating feedback from several team members throughout the life of a project can mean improved results from your content marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>Consider hosting collaborative meetings every once in a while or implementing edits from your outreach specialists if an idea falls dry.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, using a digital PR specialist in your content creation will help you create promotable content because of the work with the media and interaction online.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-pr-specialist-content-creation&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7254e177cdc584fa16ca62f114c4c6b5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Delaney Kline","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png?width=600&name=%5BGuest%20Post%20for%20Hubspot%5D%20Why%20A%20Digital%20PR%20Specialist%20Should%20Always%20Be%20Involved%20in%20Content%20Creation.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn68@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-29-190_ba3466db66c4767b.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-pr-specialist-content-creation&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-22-702_cc7c73145b6ec61a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336433},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Cybersecurity","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cybersecurity","description":"<p>If asked you to list the most valuable things you own, how would you answer? I guess this would be another way of asking the infamous “What would you grab if your house was on fire?” question.</p> \n<p>For me, I’d grab an old keepsake box filled with things from my childhood, my engagement ring, my phone and computer (for pictures and writings!), and an old Iowa sweatshirt of my dad’s.</p> \n<p>But I’d also have to say that my identity, social security number, credit cards, and bank accounts are valuable to me.</p> \n<p>While these things can’t exactly burn down in a fire, they <em>can</em> be stolen … and if I were to ask a computer hacker what they thought my most valuable possessions were, they’d probably quote the intangible.</p> \n<p>That’s why we’ve compiled this guide on cybersecurity. Below, we’ll talk about why you should care about cybersecurity, how to secure your and your customer’s digital data, and what resources to follow to stay up-to-date with emerging tech.</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>Personal data is incredibly valuable. Hackers know it, and businesses know it. That’s why both go to great lengths to collect it — albeit one following a much more legal and moral avenue to do so.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, as technology and data collection practices progress, so do the methods that hackers follow to steal data. As business owners, we have a special responsibility to protect our customers’ data and be transparent with our practices.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Why You Should Care About Cybersecurity</h2> \n<p>In the first half of 2019, data breaches exposed <a href=\"https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/2019-midyear-data-breach-quickview-report\">over 4 billion records</a>. Moreover, a recent study found that hackers attack <a href=\"https://eng.umd.edu/news/story/study-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds\">every 39 seconds</a> — that adds up to, on average, 2,244 attacks per day.</p> \n<p>Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are especially at risk. You might see corporations like Target and Sears topping the headlines as top data breach victims, but it’s actually SMBs that hackers prefer to target.</p> \n<p>Why? They have more — and more valuable — digital assets than your average consumer but less security than a larger enterprise-level company … placing them right in a “<a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8231-small-business-cybersecurity-guide.html\">hackers' cybersecurity sweet spot</a>.”</p> \n<p>Security breaches are frustrating and frightening for both businesses and consumers. <a href=\"https://www.ca.com/us/collateral/white-papers/the-global-state-of-online-digital-trust.html\">Studies show</a> that, after a company data breach, many consumers take a break from shopping at that business — and some consumers quit altogether.</p> \n<p>But cybersecurity is about more than just avoiding a PR nightmare. Investing in cybersecurity builds trust with your customers. It encourages transparency and reduces friction as customers become advocates for your brand.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“Everyone has a role in helping to protect customers’ data. Here at HubSpot, every employee is empowered to solve for customer needs in a safe and secure way. We want to harness everyone’s energy to provide a platform that customers trust to correctly and safely store their data.” — Chris McLellan, HubSpot Chief Security Officer</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/stay-current-emerging-tech\"><em>Keep your business ahead of the tech curve with the tips, systems &amp; recommended resources in our guide to staying current on emerging tech.</em></a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Cybersecurity Terms to Know</h2> \n<p>Cybersecurity is a very intimidating topic, not unlike <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cryptocurrency\">cryptocurrency</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>. It can be hard to understand, and, frankly, it sounds kind of ominous and complicated.</p> \n<p>But fear not. We’re here to break this topic down into digestible pieces that you can rebuild into your own cybersecurity strategy. Bookmark this post to keep this handy glossary at your fingertips.</p> \n<p>Here’s a comprehensive list of general cybersecurity terms you should know.</p> \n<h3>Authentication</h3> \n<p>Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. Your passwords authenticate that you really are the person who should have the corresponding username. When you show your ID (e.g., driver’s license, etc), the fact that your picture generally looks like you is a way of authenticating that the name, age, and address on the ID belong to you. Many organizations use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cybersecurity#two\">two-factor authentication, which we cover later</a>.</p> \n<h3>Backup</h3> \n<p>A backup refers to the process of transferring important data to a secure location like a cloud storage system or an external hard drive. Backups let you recover your systems to a healthy state in case of a cyber attack or system crash.</p> \n<h3>Data Breach</h3> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-breach\">data breach</a> refers to the moment a hacker gains unauthorized entry or access to a company’s or an individual’s data.</p> \n<h3>Digital Certificate</h3> \n<p>A digital certificate, also known as an identity certificate or public key certificate, is a type of passcode used to securely exchange data over the internet. It’s essentially a digital file embedded in a device or piece of hardware that provides authentication when it sends and receives data to and from another device or server.</p> \n<h3>Encryption</h3> \n<p>Encryption is the practice of using codes and ciphers to encrypt data. When data is encrypted, a computer uses a key to turn the data into unintelligible gibberish. Only a recipient with the correct key is able to decrypt the data. If an attacker gets access to strongly encrypted data but doesn’t have the key, they aren’t able to see the unencrypted version.</p> \n<h3>HTTP and HTTPS</h3> \n<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-the-internet-works\">how web browsers communicate</a>. You’ll probably see an <em>http://</em> or <em>https://</em> in front of the websites you visit. HTTP and HTTPS are the same, except HTTPS encrypts all data sent between you and the web server — hence the “S” for security. Today, nearly all websites use HTTPS to improve the privacy of your data.</p> \n<h3>Vulnerability</h3> \n<p>A vulnerability is a place of weakness that a hacker might exploit when launching a cyber attack. Vulnerabilities might be software bugs that need to be patched, or a password reset process that can be triggered by unauthorized people. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cybersecurity#defensive\">Defensive cybersecurity measures (like the ones we talk about later) </a>help ensure data is protected by putting layers of protections between attackers and the things they’re trying to do or access.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>A cyber attack is a deliberate and typically malicious intent to capture, modify, or erase private data. Cyber attacks are committed by external security hackers and, sometimes, unintentionally by compromised users or employees. <a href=\"https://blog.netwrix.com/2018/05/15/top-10-most-common-types-of-cyber-attacks/\">These cyber attacks</a> are committed for a variety of reasons. <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html\">The majority are looking for ransom</a>, while some are simply launched for fun.</p> \n<p>Here are the four most common cyber threats.</p> \n<h3>1. Password Guessing (Brute Force) Attack</h3> \n<p>A password guessing (or “credential stuffing”) attack is when an attacker continually attempts to guess usernames and passwords. This attack will often use known username and password combinations from past data breaches. An attacker is successful when people use weak passwords or use the password between different systems (e.g., when your Facebook and Twitter password are the same, etc). Your best defense against this kind of attack is using strong passwords and avoiding using the same password in multiple places as well as using two factor authentication,<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cybersecurity#passwords\"> as we talk about later</a>.)</p> \n<h3>2. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack</h3> \n<p>A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is when a hacker floods a network or system with a ton of activity (such as messages, requests, or web traffic) in order to paralyze it. This is typically done using <strong>botnets</strong>, which are groups of internet-connected devices (e.g., laptops, light bulbs, game consoles, servers, etc) infected by viruses that allow a hacker to harness them into performing many kinds of attacks.</p> \n<h3>3. Malware Attack</h3> \n<p>Malware refers to all types of malicious software used by hackers to infiltrate computers and networks and collect susceptible private data. Types of malware include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Keyloggers</strong>, which track everything a person types on their keyboard. Keyloggers are usually used to capture passwords and other private information, such as social security numbers.</li> \n <li><strong>Ransomware</strong>, which encrypts data and holds it hostage, forcing users to pay a ransom in order to unlock and regain access to their data.</li> \n <li><strong>Spyware</strong>, which monitors and “spies” on user activity on behalf of a hacker.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Furthermore, malware can be delivered via:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Trojan horses</strong>, which infect computers through a seemingly benign entry point, often disguised as a legitimate application or other piece of software.</li> \n <li><strong>Viruses</strong>, which corrupt, erase, modify, or capture data and, at times, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/\">physically damage computers</a>. Viruses can spread from computer to computer, including when they are unintentionally installed by compromised users.</li> \n <li><strong>Worms</strong>, which are designed to self-replicate and autonomously spread through all connected computers that are susceptible to the same vulnerabilities. .</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Phishing Attack</h3> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-phishing\">phishing attack</a> is when hackers try to trick people into doing something. Phishing scams can be delivered through a seemingly legitimate download, link, or message. It’s a very common type of cyber attack — <a href=\"https://www.wombatsecurity.com/state-of-the-phish\">over 75% of organizations fell victim to phishing in 2018</a>. Phishing is typically done over email or through a fake website; it’s also known as <strong>spoofing</strong>. Additionally, <strong>spear phishing</strong> refers to when a hacker focuses on attacking a particular person or company, instead of creating more general-purpose spams.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices: How to Secure Your Data</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Cybersecurity can’t be boiled down into a 1-2-3-step process. Securing your data involves a mix of best practices and defensive cybersecurity techniques. Dedicating time and resources to both is the best way to secure your — and your customers’ — data.</p> \n<h3>Defensive Cybersecurity Solutions</h3> \n<p>All businesses should invest in preventative cybersecurity solutions. Implementing these systems and adopting <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cybersecurity#cyber-security-tips\">good cybersecurity habits (which we discuss next)</a> will protect your network and computers from outside threats.</p> \n<p>Here’s a list of six defensive cybersecurity systems and software options that can prevent cyber attacks — and the inevitable headache that follows. Consider combining these solutions to cover all your digital bases.</p> \n<h4>Antivirus Software</h4> \n<p>Antivirus software is the digital equivalent of taking that vitamin C boost during flu season. It’s a preventative measure that monitors for bugs. The job of antivirus software is to detect viruses on your computer and remove them, much like vitamin C does when bad things enter your immune system. (Spoken like a true medical professional …) Antivirus software also alerts you to potentially unsafe web pages and software.</p> \n<p><strong>Learn more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/store/m0/catalog/mavb_511/mcafee-antivirus-basic.html\">McAfee</a>, <a href=\"https://us.norton.com/antivirus\">Norton</a>. or <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/free-antivirus/\">Panda</a> (for free)</p> \n<h4>Firewall</h4> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personal-firewall\">firewall</a> is a digital wall that keeps malicious users and software out of your computer. It uses a filter that assesses the safety and legitimacy of everything that wants to enter your computer; it’s like an invisible judge that sits between you and the internet. Firewalls are both software and hardware-based.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p><strong>Learn more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/store/m0/catalog/mls_430/mcafee-livesafe.html\">McAfee LiveSafe</a> or <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/internet-security\">Kaspersky Internet Security</a><a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/internet-security\"></a></p> \n<h4>Single Sign-On (SSO)</h4> \n<p>Single sign-on (SSO) is a centralized authentication service through which one login is used to access an entire platform of accounts and software. If you’ve ever used your Google account to sign up or into an account, you’ve used SSO. Enterprises and corporations use SSO to allow employees access to internal applications that contain proprietary data.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p><strong>Learn more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.okta.com/\">Okta</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\">LastPass</a><a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\"></a></p> \n<h4>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/two-factor-authentication\">Two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> is a login process that requires a username or pin number <em>and</em> access to an external device or account, such as an email address, phone number, or security software. 2FA requires users to confirm their identity through both and, because of that, is far more secure than single factor authentication.</p> \n<p><strong>Learn more</strong>: <a href=\"https://duo.com/\">Duo</a></p> \n<h4>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h4> \n<p>A virtual private network (VPN) creates a “tunnel” through which your data travels when entering and exiting a web server. That tunnel encrypts and protects your data so that it can’t be read (or spied on) by hackers or malicious software. While a VPN protects against spyware, it can’t prevent viruses from entering your computer through seemingly legitimate channels, like phishing or even a fake VPN link. Because of this, VPNs should be combined with other defensive cybersecurity measures in order to protect your data.</p> \n<p><strong>Learn more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/index.html\">Cisco's AnyConnect</a> or <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/globalprotect/cloudservice\">Palo Alto Networks’ GlobalProtect</a><a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/globalprotect/cloudservice\"></a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Cybersecurity Tips for Business</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Defensive cybersecurity solutions won’t work unless you do. To ensure your business and customer data is protected, adopt these good cybersecurity habits across your organization.</p> \n<h3>Require strong credentials.</h3> \n<p>Require both your employees and users (if applicable) to create strong passwords. This can be done by implementing a character minimum as well as requiring a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. More complicated passwords are harder to guess by both individuals and bots. Also, require that passwords be changed regularly.</p> \n<div> \n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Cybersecurity.png?width=1500&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Cybersecurity.png\" alt=\"guide to cybersecurity require strong credentials\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"> </img>\n</div> \n<h3>Control and monitor employee activity.</h3> \n<p>Within your business, only give access to important data to authorized employees who need it for their job. Prohibit data from sharing outside the organization, require permission for external software downloads, and encourage employees to lock their computers and accounts whenever not in use.</p> \n<h3>Know your network.</h3> \n<p>With the rise of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/internet-of-things-iot\">Internet of Things</a>, IoT devices are popping up on company networks like crazy. These devices, which are not under company management, can introduce risk as they’re often unsecured and run vulnerable software that can be exploited by hackers and provide a direct pathway into an internal network.</p> \n<blockquote>\n  “Make sure you have visibility into all the IoT devices on your network. Everything on your corporate network should be identified, properly categorized, and controlled. By knowing what devices are on your network, controlling how they connect to it, and monitoring them for suspicious activities, you'll drastically reduce the landscape attackers are playing on.” — Nick Duda, Principal Security Officer at HubSpot \n</blockquote> \n<p><em>Read about how HubSpot gains device visibility and automates security management in <a href=\"https://www.forescout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fs-cs-hubspot.pdf\">this case study compiled by security software ForeScout</a>.</em></p> \n<h3>Download patches and updates regularly.</h3> \n<p>Software vendors regularly release updates that address and fix vulnerabilities. Keep your software safe by updating it on a consistent basis. Consider configuring your software to update automatically so you never forget.</p> \n<h3>Make it easy for employees to escalate issues.</h3> \n<p>If your employee comes across a phishing email or compromised web page, you want to know immediately. Set up a system for receiving these issues from employees by dedicating an inbox to these notifications or creating a form that people can fill out.</p> \n<h2>Cybersecurity Tips for Individuals</h2> \n<p>Cyber threats can affect you as an individual consumer and internet user, too. Adopt these good habits to protect your personal data and avoid cyber attacks.</p> \n<h3>Mix up your passwords.</h3> \n<p>Using the same password for all your important accounts is the digital equivalent of leaving a spare key under your front doormat. A <a href=\"https://blog.centrify.com/verizon-compromised-credentials/\">recent study</a> found that over 80% of data breaches were a result of weak or stolen passwords. Even if a business or software account doesn’t require a strong password, always choose one that has a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols and change it regularly.</p> \n<h3>Monitor your bank accounts and credit frequently.</h3> \n<p>Review your statements, credit reports, and other critical data on a regular basis and report any suspicious activity. Additionally, only release your social security number when absolutely necessary.</p> \n<h3>Be intentional online.</h3> \n<p>Keep an eye out for phishing emails or illegitimate downloads. If a link or website looks fishy (ha — get it?), it <em>probably</em> is. Look for bad spelling and grammar, suspicious URLs, and mismatched email addresses. Lastly, download antivirus and security software to alert you of potential and known malware sources.</p> \n<h3>Back up your data regularly.</h3> \n<p>This habit is good for businesses and individuals to master — data can be compromised for both parties. Consider backups on both cloud and physical locations, such as a hard drive or thumb drive.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Cybersecurity Resources</h2> \n<p>To learn more about cybersecurity and how to better equip your business and team, tap into the resources below.

They're customizable, sharable, and they're easier to create than you might think.</p> \n<p>Sure, you could hire a professional to create the infographics for you. But if you're restricted by budgets or time, there are some great DIY resources out there for making compelling visuals.</p> \n<p>To help visual marketers, we scouted the web for some of best sites and tools for building infographics. Check them out below.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Helpful Resources for Creating Infographics</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.canva.com\">Canva</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free with limited features, $9.95/month for Pro, or $30/month for Enterprise.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Canva-16.png?width=600&amp;name=Canva-16.png\" width=\"600\" title=\"Canva-16.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"creating infographics in Canva\"></p> \n<p>Oh, how we love the ease and intuitiveness of Canva.</p> \n<p>From the very beginning, it asks you a series of simple, colorfully-illustrated questions about what’s brought you to their site. (Today, it’s infographics, but there’s a ton of other stuff you can create there, too.)</p> \n<p>Once you’ve let Canva know what you want to do, the site generates several templates you can use as a foundation for your infographic. Plus, it’s got a library of roughly 1,000,000 images that you can add to your project.</p> \n<p>From there, you can edit the text, background image, shapes and other aspects of the infographic to make it your own. And it’s so easy -- here’s a goofy one that I put together on how my dog spends his day:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png?width=669&amp;name=Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" alt=\"Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DACA4CZE14s/cbwuFIIiTFB1Zdcq_doPPw/view?utm_content=DACA4CZE14s&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton\">Image Source</a></em> </span></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://piktochart.com/\">Piktochart</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $24/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Piktochart2.png?width=669&amp;name=Piktochart2.png\" alt=\"Piktochart2.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"Piktochart2.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>Similar to Canva, Piktochart can be used to design more than just infographics -- it can also build reports, presentations, and posters.</p> \n<p>But the templates available for infographics are numerous, and there’s an upgrade available. “Pro” memberships -- which run between $24 to $80, depending on the features you want -- allow access to even more templates, as well as removed watermarks and hi-res downloads.</p> \n<p>When it comes to creating the infographic itself, the features are fairly similar to Canva’s -- the background, text, and images can all be changed, or users can upload their own files for greater personalization.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://venngage.com/\">Venngage</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $19/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Vanngage.png?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Vanngage.png\" alt=\"Venngage infographic software steps\" width=\"600\" title=\"Venngage.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Like its predecessors above, Venngage has quite a few design features, including&nbsp;<span>an </span><a href=\"https://venngage.com\"><span>infographic maker</span></a><span> and&nbsp;</span>its great social media templates, which users can download to create their own personalized Instagram posts, blog headers, and more.</p> \n<p>For infographics, there's a decent range of templates, each categorized by type -- statistical, process, and timeline, to name a few.</p> \n<p>Some of the templates are limited to premium members, reflecting Venngage's four-tiered approach to pricing -- free, premium, education, and non-profit. Plus, there are templates available for those latter two categories. Here's one that helps non-profits visually communicate highlights from an annual report:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.venngage.com/template/bbc41da5-9284-44d3-a915-bec91ff75f26.png?noresize\" alt=\"Venngage Infographic\" width=\"669\" title=\"Venngage Infographic\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.easel.ly\">Easel.ly</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Starts at $4/month with special discounts for students and educators.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/easelly.png?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=easelly.png\" alt=\"easelly infographic templates\" width=\"600\" title=\"easelly.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Upon visiting Easel.ly's website, you're immediately presented with a plethora of infographic templates, most of which can be immediately clicked and customized without having to create an account. If you want to save and share your work, though, you will have to join -- for free.</p> \n<p>Unlike its predecessors listed here, Easel.ly seems to be a no-frills platform that's comprised of infographics. You can choose which category you'd like, but it's not quite as organized as some other sites -- the drop-down menu is a bit hidden to the left of the templates. Still, most of templates appear to be available for free (more become available with a Pro membership), and they're fairly easy to edit.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"http://www.freepik.com\">Freepik</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free, with paid packages available starting at $7.50/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/freepik.png?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=freepik.png\" alt=\"freepik.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"freepik.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>As its name suggests, Freepik is a resource for, well, free pictures. Infographics are just one type, but after performing a search for them, there are plenty of options -- most of which are complimentary.</p> \n<p>The only drawback? Freepik doesn't quite allow the same level&nbsp;of customization that some others in this list do. You can download the images for free, but you’ll need a vector graphics editor in order to customize them -- Brittany Leaning and Megan Conley of HubSpot's content marketing team both suggest using <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html\">Adobe Illustrator</a>.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://infogr.am\">Infogram</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> A limited number of options available for free, with paid packages available starting at $19/month</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/infogram%20examples-1.png?width=600&amp;name=infogram%20examples-1.png\" alt=\"infogram examples\" width=\"600\" title=\"infogram examples-1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Like many of its visual peers, Infogram is a resource that helps users create both picturesque charts and infographics. It's definitely one of the more \"grown-up\" sites available for building these images, which might explain why very few of their tools a re free -- including restricting your work from public consumption.</p> \n<p>However, Infogram also has the option of enlisting professional help with infographic design. So if you're short on time and have a bit of room in your budget, this route might be the best one for you.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/\">Google Charts</a></h3> \n<p><strong>Cost: Free</strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_charts.gif?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Google_charts.gif\" alt=\"Google_charts gif example\" width=\"600\" title=\"Google_charts.gif\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Okay, maybe a chart isn’t exactly the same as an infographic. But, given the interesting selection templates made available by Google, we would be remiss to exclude it.</p> \n<p>There are a few items of value in Google charts. First, we love the selection of charts available. From animated bubble graphs -- like the one above -- to clever word trees, the features allow users to bring information to life. (I mean, admit it -- adding animation to data always makes it a little less boring.)</p> \n<p>Plus, these charts can be created to be interactive. One of our favorites, GeoCharts, allows data to be assigned to different regions of a map that appear when hovered over. Check it out:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_Geo_Charts.gif?noresize&amp;width=600&amp;name=Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" alt=\"Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" width=\"600\" title=\"Google_Geo_Charts.gif\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart\">Image Source</a></em> </span></p> \n<p>We'll admit that some features of Google Charts might be a bit more advanced than the other resources we’ve listed. But, if you’re ready to step up your visuals game, give it a try.</p> \n<h2>Start Creating Infographics</h2> \n<p>There's no shortage of resources when it comes to creating your own visuals -- charts, reports, and infographics. And, depending on your budget and needs, there's a veritable plethora of options available, all of which have their pros, with very few cons.</p> \n<p>Want to learn more about designing brilliant infographics? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographics-with-free-powerpoint-templates\">Check out these helpful tips</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fresources-for-creating-infographics&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"fba938449a6562b793d104947f750ea1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Amanda Zantal-Wiener","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Canva-16.png?width=600&name=Canva-16.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-24-377_cfaa08a627856143.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png?width=669&name=Tullamores_Day_Infographic_2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn25@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-26-928_8516b0a93c76b0c1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Piktochart2.png?width=669&name=Piktochart2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn78@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-20-991_99f03e97d8ab3710.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Vanngage.png?noresize&width=600&name=Vanngage.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-22-968_773ab0960b65f583.webp","https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.venngage.com/template/bbc41da5-9284-44d3-a915-bec91ff75f26.png?noresize":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-20-133_eb42a7670a367740.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/easelly.png?noresize&width=600&name=easelly.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn27@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-20-663_1b94ce1f79060b1d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/freepik.png?noresize&width=669&name=freepik.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-25-981_7dfd1560c61ec582.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/infogram%20examples-1.png?width=600&name=infogram%20examples-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn65@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-25-637_809907476669fb88.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_charts.gif?noresize&width=600&name=Google_charts.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn50@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-28-296_01640727dad5e3fa.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google_Geo_Charts.gif?noresize&width=600&name=Google_Geo_Charts.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn12@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-21-981_1a165a7d66171e7f.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fresources-for-creating-infographics&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-22-772_4f9c272a6eea9c51.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336433},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"The 30-60-90 Day Plan: Your Guide for Mastering a New Job [Template + Example]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/30-60-90-day-plan","description":"<p>With all the joy and excitement of landing a new job, you can feel just as much fear and anxiety. The same can go for the hiring manager.</p>  \n<p>Overcoming a new role's learning curve and the desire to make a lasting impression on your employer can put a lot of pressure on you. What if you can't adapt in time?</p>  \n<p>Fortunately, there's a way to organize and prioritize your time and tasks, helping you seamlessly adapt to your new environment. It's called a 30-60-90 day plan. And following it enables you to soak in as much information as possible, master your core job responsibilities, and sets you up to make a lasting impact on your new team.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Think of a 30-60-90 day plan as a new employee's North Star, keeping your sights set in the right direction and guiding you toward success. But before we show you how to write this plan, let's go over what exactly it is and how it'll enhance your performance during your (or your employee's) first three months on the job.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll cover everything you need to know about 30-60-90 day plans whether you're writing one for yourself or a new hire on the team.</p> \n<p>There are two situations where you'd write a 30-60-90 day plan: during the final stages of an interview process and during the first week of the job itself. Here's how each type can be executed:</p> \n<h3>30-60-90 Day Plan for Interview</h3> \n<p>Some hiring managers ask candidates to think about and explain their potential 30-60-90 day plan as a new hire. They want to see if they can organize their time, prioritize the tasks they'd likely take on, and strategize an approach to the job description.</p> \n<p>For a new hire, a well thought-out 30-60-90 day plan is a great way to help the hiring manager visualize you in the role and differentiate yourself from all other candidates.</p> \n<p>Of course, it can be difficult to outline your goals for yourself before you accept a new job. So, how are you supposed to know what those goals are? Start with the job description. Normally, open job listings have separate sections for a job's responsibilities and a job's qualifications. Work to find commonalities in these two sections, and how you might turn them into goals for yourself staggered over the course of three months.</p> \n<p>For example, if a job requires three years of experience in Google Analytics, and the responsibilities include tracking the company's website performance every month, use these points to develop an action plan explaining how you'll learn the company's key performance metrics (first 30 days), strengthen the company's performance in these metrics (next 30 days), and then lead the team toward a better Google Analytics strategy (last 30 days).</p> \n<h3>30-60-90 Day Plan for New Job</h3> \n<p>The second situation where you'd write a 30-60-90 day plan is during the first week of a new job. If you're the hiring manager, this plan will allow you to learn how the new employee operates, address any of their concerns or preconceived notions about the role, and ultimately help them succeed.</p> \n<p>If you're starting a new job, and are not asked to craft a 30-60-90 day plan during the first week of that job, it's still a good idea to write one for yourself. A new job can feel like a completely foreign environment during the first few months, and having a plan in place can make it feel more like home.</p> \n<p>Even though 90 days is the standard grace period for new employees to learn the ropes, it's also the best time to make a great first impression.</p> \n<p>The purpose of your plan is to help you transition into your new role, but it should also be a catalyst for your career development. Instead of just guiding you over your job's learning curve, the goals outlined in your plan should push you to perform up to your potential and raise your bar for success at its every stage.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>30-60-90 Day Plan for Managers [Template]</h2> \n<p>Almost all 30-60-90 day plans consist of a learning phase, a contributing phase, and a leading phase — which we'll go over in the example plan below. This includes plans that are designed to guide people in new <em>management</em> roles. What sets apart a <em>manager's</em> plan from any other is their obligation to their direct reports and the decisions they're trusted to make for the business.</p> \n<p>If you're accepting (or hiring for) a new manager role, consider any of the following goals and how to roll them out at a pace that sets you up for success.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/30,%2060,%2090%20Day%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=30,%2060,%2090%20Day%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg\" alt=\"free editable 30 60 90 day plan template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Get to your know your team's strengths and weaknesses.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: First 30 days</h4> \n<p>Everyone is learning the ropes in their first month at a company. For managers, much of that learning happens by talking to the team.</p> \n<p>If you're a new manager, grab some time with your direct reports and get to know their roles. What do they like about them? What are their biggest pain points?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/5-goals-of-effective-managers\">Making your team happy</a> is a hard goal to measure, but it's an important responsibility to take on as a manager. Your first step is to figure out how you'll manage and coach your employees through their day-to-day work.</p> \n<h3>Improve the cost-effectiveness of your team's budget.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>Managers often have access to (and control over) the budget for their department's investments — things like software, office supplies, and new hires. After you spend the first couple of months learning what the team spends its money on, consider using the final 30 days of your plan to make suggestions for new investments or how to reallocate money where you think it needs to be.</p> \n<p>Is there a tool that can automate a task that's taking your team forever to do manually? Draft a financial strategy that includes this tool in the following quarter's budget.</p> \n<h3>Help a direct report acquire a new skill.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Second 30 days</h4> \n<p>Even though you're new to the company, you were hired for a reason: You've got skills. And you can bring these skills to the people you work with, particularly those people who report to you.</p> \n<p>After meeting with and learning about your new colleagues, you might use the second month of your on-boarding plan to find skill gaps on your team that you can help fill.</p> \n<p>Do you have expert-level experience with HubSpot, and your new company just started using <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing?_ga=2.73575319.440552189.1554432490-1093622293.1516842654\">HubSpot Marketing Hub</a>? Teach them how to do something in the platform they didn't know before.</p> \n<h3>Draft a training strategy that can help guide your direct reports into new roles.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>You won't be expected to promote people in the first three months of your new job, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have learned enough about your team to decide who's good at what and how to coach them to where they want to be.</p> \n<p>In the final 30 days of your 30-60-90 day plan, you might agree to a goal to develop a training strategy that outlines how to manage your direct reports, and ultimately how to guide them into new roles in the future.</p> \n<h2>30-60-90 Day Plan for Executives</h2> \n<p>Executives are a little different from managers in that there's higher performance expectations coming in. As an executive, you'll need to be highly engaged with the organization from the first day and implement high-impact changes in your role as soon as you can. At the same time, context is important, and you'll need to understand the culture, team, current operating processes, and challenges before you solve for them.</p> \n<p>Here are some critical steps to include in your 30-60-90 day plan in an executive role.</p> \n<h3>Soak up as much information as possible.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: First 30 days</h4> \n<p>There's no point in taking action without context, so start your ramp-up period by gathering information and charting the lay of the land. That means reviewing existing documentation, attending as many meetings as you can, meeting with direct reports and skip levels, and ask a lot of questions.</p> \n<h3>Create alignment between you and the team.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: First 30 days</h4> \n<p>In the first 30 days, you'll be meeting new people and understanding their roles in the organization. Ultimately, your job as an executive is to set the vision for the organization while removing roadblocks for your team as they strategize and execute on it.</p> \n<p>One of the best questions you can ask as you familiarize yourself and align with your team is, \"In your opinion, what are some existing threats to our business (external or internal)?\"</p> \n<p>This shows that you care about their opinion and trust their expertise while getting unique perspectives from multiple vantage points in the organization. Plus, if you start hearing some of the same points from multiple team members, you'll be able to identify the biggest pains, equipping you to make the highest impact changes.</p> \n<h3>Create goals based on what you've learned.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Second 30 days</h4> \n<p>When you are interviewing or shortly after you're hired, you'll get a feel for the types of pains that the executive team has and the objectives in mind for bringing you on.</p> \n<p>Once you have more context about how the organization works, you can take this vision and translate it into concrete, measurable goals that will take your department to the next level.</p> \n<h3>Identify the A players on the team.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: First 30 days</h4> \n<p>An A player is a member of your team that goes above and beyond what's expected in their role. While not every employee will be an A player, you'll want to ensure that critical roles and teams have at least one A player to lead, inspire, and strengthen camaraderie.</p> \n<p>From there, you can figure out the existing gaps in staffing and training, whether it's team members who need a lot of guidance and must be coached up to performance or empty roles that need to be filled altogether.</p> \n<h3>Diagnose process issues.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Second 30 days</h4> \n<p>Companies of all sizes run into operational issues as they implement processes that are efficient and work at scale. Sometimes, when an executive team isn't aligned with middle management, processes can become unwieldy.</p> \n<p>Learn why things are done the way they are and then figure out if there are workarounds you can implement to streamline operations. Perhaps it's as simple as eliminating bottlenecks or adding automation to certain functions.</p> \n<h3>Put together and implement hiring plan.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>You know your A and B players, and you hopefully have a plan to retain, invest in, and mentor them. However, you'll likely come across gaps that you need to fill and positions that need to be created to eliminate bottlenecks. From there, you'll want to create a hiring plan to execute, both for short-term, middle-term, and long-term needs.</p> \n<h3>Effect changes in operations.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>Speaking of bottlenecks, your final 30 days of your plan should be focusing on the areas of the business that can achieve the results the fastest. Once you've identified these, you can focus on removing these roadblocks to start hitting goals and achieving higher performance.</p> \n<h3>Contribute to broader company goals.</h3> \n<h4>Recommended phase: Final 30 days</h4> \n<p>As a member of the executive team, you'll also be looped in one high-level company initiatives, and the other executives of the company will be relying on you to contribute your deep discipline expertise and experience.</p> \n<p>Be ready to lean in on executive meetings and contribute to the vision and strategy of the organization as it moves forward.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Write a 30-60-90 Day Plan</h2> \n<p>No matter what the level of the job for which a company is hiring, improving an employee's skills requires concrete performance goals, so watch out for vagueness in the objectives you set for yourself.</p> \n<p>“Write a better blog post,” or “get better at brainstorming” are terrific ambitions, but they don't give you a way to measure your progress in them. Set goals that are realistic, quantifiable, and focused. You'll know exactly how to achieve them and gauge your success.</p> \n<p>To write challenging yet feasible performance goals, ask yourself the following questions:</p> \n<h3>What are my team's goals?</h3> \n<p>Try to understand the purpose behind your team's goals. It'll give you more insight into why you and your team should achieve them, motivating you to work as hard as possible to meet those goals.</p> \n<h3>What will be my main priorities?</h3> \n<p>By connecting your personal responsibilities to your team's goals, you'll know exactly how to align your tasks with the needs of the team, which keeps you accountable and compels you to help your team achieve their goals.</p> \n<h3>How will I measure my progress?</h3> \n<p>Tracking your progress helps you gauge your performance and rate of improvement. To see how you're doing, set up weekly meetings with your manager to ask her what she thinks of your work and track the improvement of your own performance metrics, like the growth of your blog posts' average views or the amount of qualified leads your eBooks generate.</p> \n<p>Reaching your performance goals isn't the only path toward future success in your new role, though. You also need to study the ins and outs of your team and company, take initiative, and develop relationships with coworkers — all things that a lot of new hires underestimate the importance of.</p> \n<p>Consider setting the following types of goals during each stage of your 30-60-90 day plan:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Learning Goals</strong> - How will you absorb as much information as possible about your company, team, and role?</li> \n <li><strong>Initiative Goals</strong> - What will you do to stand out?</li> \n <li><strong>Personal Goals</strong> - How will you integrate with your company and team?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Aiming to achieve these types of goals will help you hit the ground running in all the right areas of your job. And if you stick to your plan, you'll notice you'll be able to spend less time learning and more time executing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>30-60-90 Day Plan Template With Examples</h2> \n<p>Behold, your 30-60-90 day plan template.

Here's an example:</p> \n<h3>30 Days</h3> \n<h4>Primer</h4> \n<p>Many new hires are eager to impress, so they dive head-first into their work or try to make suggestions about their team's process with limited experience in how their new team operates. But have patience.</p> \n<p>Understanding your company's vision and your team's existing strategy is crucial for producing high-quality work and actually making an impact. If you don't know the purpose behind your role or the optimal way to perform, you'll risk missing the mark and your early efforts won't pay off the way you expect them to.</p> \n<p>It's always better to over-prepare than under-prepare. And it's okay to take time to learn the ropes — it pays huge dividends in the long run. In the first 30 days of your employment, your priority is to be a sponge and soak in as much information as possible. Once you do that, you can then try to improve more specific parts of your team's work style.</p> \n<h4>Theme: Be a Sponge</h4> \n<h5>Learning Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Study my company's mission, vision, and overarching strategy.</li> \n <li>Read my company's culture code to learn more about our company culture and why we implement it.</li> \n <li>Read the customer persona and target audience overview to truly understand who our customers are, their pain points, and how our product and content can help them.</li> \n <li>Meet with my team's director to learn about how meeting our goals will help our business grow.</li> \n <li>Read up on our team's new SEO strategy, editorial process, and traffic goals.</li> \n <li>Learn how to use the SEO Insights Report to plan and structure blog posts.</li> \n <li>Review my team's pillar-cluster model overview and understand how to match posts to clusters.</li> \n <li>Meet with my manager to learn more about her expectations.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Performance Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Complete new hire training and pass the test with a 90% or higher.</li> \n <li>Be able to write 3 blog posts per week.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Initiative Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Run the Facebook Instant Article experiment that my manager recommended me to do.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Personal Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Grab coffee with everyone on my team, so I can get to know them on a professional and personal level.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>60 Days</h3> \n<h4>Primer</h4> \n<p>By the end of your first 60 days, you should ramp up your workload, start overachieving, and make a name for yourself on your team.</p> \n<p>To do this, start speaking up more at meetings. Don't be afraid to share your ideas about improving your team's processes. This shows you're quickly conquering the learning curve and recognizing some flaws that your colleagues might've overlooked. You still have a fresh perspective on the company, so your insight is invaluable.</p> \n<h4>Theme: Be a Contributor</h4> \n<h5>Learning Goals:</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Learn how to optimize a new post from scratch based on both the SEO Insights Report and my own competitive research.</li> \n <li>Read every other marketing team's wiki page to learn about other marketing initiatives and how our entire department works together to grow our business.</li> \n <li>Deep dive into my company's product roadmap and strategy to fully grasp our mission and vision.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Performance Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Be able to write 5 blog posts per week.</li> \n <li>Be down to one cycle of edits per post.</li> \n <li>Understand how to edit a guest post -- clean up at least one rough draft.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Initiative Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Share content strategy idea at my team's monthly meeting and ask if I can spearhead the project to boost blog traffic.</li> \n <li>Ask my manager if I can oversee Facebook messenger and Slack distribution strategy.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Personal Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Meet with my colleagues on other teams to learn about their marketing initiatives and develop relationships outside of my team.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>90 Days</h3> \n<h4>Primer</h4> \n<p>By the end of your first three months, you should have a firm grasp of your role, feel confident about your abilities, and be on the cusp of making a breakthrough contribution to your team. Instead of reacting to problems that pop up at random, be proactive and spearhead a new initiative for your team.</p> \n<p>You should also be cognizant of how you can collaborate with other teams to improve your own team's processes. By taking on some new projects outside of your main role, you'll start turning some heads and catch the attention of the department at large.</p> \n<h4>Theme: Be a Leader</h4> \n<h5>Learning Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Do an analysis of my highest and lowest performing blog post up to date. How can I use this information to optimize new content so it performs better out of the gate?</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Performance Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Be comfortable with writing five blog posts per week</li> \n <li>Edit one guest post per week</li> \n <li>Try to have 75% of my blog posts not require revisions.</li> \n <li>Write at least one new post that generates over 10,000 views in one month.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Initiative Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Ask SEO team if they want to partner with product marketing team to brainstorm content topics related to our product road map.</li> \n <li>Ask social media team if they're willing to develop a relationship where we can share each other's content.</li> \n <li>Ask sales team what our customers' pain points are, so we can write content that our target audience craves and help them close more qualified leads.</li> \n</ul> \n<h5>Personal Goals</h5> \n<ul> \n <li>Join the yoga club.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Learning the nuances of your new role in less than three months won't be easy. But crafting a strong 30-60-90 day plan is your best bet for accelerating your development and adapting to your new work environment as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<div></div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2F30-60-90-day-plan&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 14:53:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8a6f144720f7dbd1b6377623ebd539b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/30,%2060,%2090%20Day%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&name=30,%2060,%2090%20Day%20Plan%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn78@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-21-256_aee4f44e77411392.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2F30-60-90-day-plan&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn94@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-21-519_937e7560f9c90806.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336436},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How to Write a Press Release [Free Press Release Template + Examples]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht","description":"<p>When it comes to content, sometimes old school can be a good thing (namely, when it comes to old-school rap or Throwback Thursday on Instagram). But when it comes to your company's <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/newsworthy-guide-to-inbound-public-relations\" style=\"letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;\">public relations strategy</a>, being old school isn't advantageous for your business or your brand.</p> \n<p>Ten years ago, people still relied on morning papers for news. Today, the vast majority of your company's customers and prospects scan headlines on Twitter or see what’s trending in their Facebook feed.</p> \n<p>People now have control over where, when, and how they consume information. As a result, public relations is no longer about feeding into a traditional news cycle; it's about providing relevant content when, where, and how your prospects, influencers, and customers will consume it.</p> \n<p>Sounds pretty hopeless, right? Wrong. While relationship-building still helps you get into popular publications, we now have the <strong>opportunity to quit playing the waiting game and generate our own buzz</strong>. By <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/newsworthy-guide-to-inbound-public-relations\">turning your PR strategy into an inbound one</a>, you create opportunities that weren’t there before and carve out a place for your company, building meaningful mindshare with your target audiences in the process.</p> \n<p>One of the most crucial updates to make to your PR strategy is to think of opportunities to connect to the audiences you care about -- including, but not limited to, reporters. And that starts with press releases. In this post, we'll discuss:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht#what-is\">What Is a Press Release?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht#types\">Types of Press Releases</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht#sample\">Sample Press Release Format</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht#how-to-write\">How to Write a Press Release</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht#examples\">Press Release Examples</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht#tips\">Tips for Publishing Press Releases</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What Is a Press Release / News Release?</h2> \n<p>A regular cadence of meaningful news can help a company stand out and build mindshare with journalists over time. That's where the press release (or news announcement) comes in.</p> \n<p>A press release is an official announcement (written or recorded) that an organization issues to the news media and beyond. Whether we call it a \"press release,\" a \"press statement,\" a \"news release,\" or a \"media release,\" we're always talking about the same basic thing.</p> \n<p>While the heading should contain action verbs, the first paragraph should answer the \"who,\" \"what,\" \"why,\" and \"where.\" The press release should also contain understandable language and a quote.</p> \n<p>Most press releases are succinct at just a page long -- two pages, tops. Ultimately, companies want to provide enough information so that news outlets have sufficient material for publishing their own stories about whatever the company is announcing in the release.</p> \n<p>And while it may be tempting to craft a press release that embellishes your company's accomplishments or twists the facts to make a story sound more intriguing to the media, remember: Press releases live in the public domain, which means your customers and prospective customers can see them. So instead of thinking of a press release solely as a ticket to earning news coverage, you should also think of it as a valuable piece of marketing content.</p> \n<p>While there's no cut-and-dried formula for what a press release should include, here are a few types of occasions to help you carve out a focus for your press release and determine what content would help you broadcast your news in the best way:</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<h3>New Product Launches</h3> \n<p>The product launch type of press release is valuable to get the word out about the new solutions your organization is offering to consumers. This release will emphasize the product's specs, pricing, availability, and any other details that may be valuable to consumers.</p> \n<h3>Mergers and Acquisitions</h3> \n<p>Organizational change is noteworthy enough to warrant a press release, especially for informing current and future stakeholders about the growth and trajectory of a company. To announce an acquisition or merger, include details about all organizations involved, information about the merger or acquisition, and quotes from the leadership teams.</p> \n<h3>Product Updates</h3> \n<p>Similar to a new product launch, product updates and expansions are also ripe for promotion. Explain what the change is, why it was made, and how it benefits the user.</p> \n<h3>Events</h3> \n<p>Press releases are an important component of event marketing to attract promotion from news outlets and other media sources. You'll want to include what the event is about, who should consider attending, when and where it will be held, pricing, and any other necessary details.</p> \n<h3>Grand Openings</h3> \n<p>Whether you opened up a new office, relocated, or are opening for the first time, announce the details with a grand opening press release. Announce the date and location the grand opening will be held, who is involved, how the grand opening is being celebrated, and the reason for the move (if applicable).</p> \n<h3>New Partnerships</h3> \n<p>Similar to mergers and acquisitions, a press release announcing new partnerships is a mutually beneficial marketing tactic. To effectively execute this type of release, be sure to write a summary about each company, why the partnership was created, who benefits, and any additional important details for current and future stakeholders.</p> \n<h3>Rebranding</h3> \n<p>Rebranding is a difficult thing for any business to do, and it can occasionally result in confusion and awkwardness. One way to make the transition smoother is by announcing the rebrand with a press release, including details on what is changing, the reason for making the change, dates the changes go into effect, and quotes from the leadership team.</p> \n<h3>Executive Promotions/Hiring</h3> \n<p>Executives often serve as faces of the company, and a press release functions to kick off this role. It may include biographical information to establish their credibility along with a photo and other pertinent details.</p> \n<h3>Awards</h3> \n<p>When it comes to business excellence, it's okay to brag. Press releases about awards and accomplishments serve to cement your organization as an authority in your space. Such a press release includes information about the company and why they were given the award, information about the award itself, and details about the ceremony (if applicable).</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Sample Press Release Format</h2> \n<p>When formatting a press-release, you want to write it in a newsy, straightforward way so a journalist who might write about it can imagine it as an article on their news site.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>As noted above, you'll want your format to include traditional press-release items like your contact information, the words \"For immediate release,\" a note about your location, and a quick bio about your company. Having specific spots for those elements will prevent you from needing to mention it in your body copy so you can focus on discussing the news at hand.</p> \n<p>You also might want to include \"###\" or another signifier to show the journalist that the release has ended. In the past, this prevented busy journalists from waiting or flipping the page for more information when there was no more news. However, this tradition is <a href=\"https://www.thehalogroup.com/what-does-mean-at-the-end-of-a-press-release/\">still adopted and highly-respected today</a>.</p> \n<p>When it comes to formatting the body copy and headline, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht#Rule1\">click here</a> or scroll down for writing tips.</p> \n<p>In this example, Catbrella Inc., a fictitious ad agency which just gained its 10th Twitter follower after two years of paid social media efforts, announces its achievement in a press release.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/press-release-example-hubspot.png\" alt=\"Sample press release format by HubSpot, with orange markers showing five rules to follow\" title=\"press-release-example-hubspot.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> \n<p><em>*Disclaimer: HubSpot is entirely responsible for the silliness of this faux announcement.</em></p> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <a></a> \n  <h2>How to Write a Press Release</h2> \n </div> \n <img alt=\"How to write a press release\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/press-release-example-hubspot.png?width=347&amp;name=press-release-example-hubspot.png\" width=\"347\" style=\"width: 347px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n  <div>\n    Writing a press release to break important company news can help businesses grow better, but doing it right is just as important. Here's how to write a press release, like the one above, step-by-step. \n  </div> <a></a> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <h3>Rule 1: Make your headline irresistible.</h3> \n   </div> \n   <div> \n    <div> \n     <p>You've got your announcement in mind, and now it's time to get it down in words to share with your community, industry, and followers. Just like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht\">writing the perfect blog post title</a>, setting up your press release for success starts with your headline. You only have one line to work with, which can seem scary, but consider diction carefully to make your headline captivating.</p> \n     <p>Use action verbs, clear, understandable language, and keep your headline simple and short -- fortune (and search engines) reward the brief, so keep your title to one line to clearly focus people's attention on your topline message.</p> \n     <p>Most importantly, make it interesting: Keep in mind that reporters get dozens, if not hundreds, of releases each day, so invest the time to write a compelling headline. It's worth the time and effort on your part.</p> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <h3>Rule 2: Convey the news value to the press.</h3> \n   </div> \n   <div> \n    <div> \n     <p>For reporters, analysts, influencers, or followers to be inclined to share your announcement, you have to tell them upfront why they should care.</p> \n     <p>The first paragraph of your release should cover the who, what, why, where, and how of your new launch, update, or development. Reporters don't have a ton of time to sift through details and fluffy background information -- they just need the facts that'll help them tell your story to someone else from a position of authority.</p> \n     <p>There shouldn't be any new, crucial information covered after this section that the reader could potentially miss. <i>A good way to ensure this is by using the </i><a href=\"https://blog.justreachout.io/how-to-write-press-release/\"><i>reverse pyramid formula</i></a><i> when writing your press release.&nbsp;</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <h3>Rule 3: Offer a tempting quote.</h3> \n   </div> \n   <div> \n    <div> \n     <p>Once you've set the scene, it's time to bring your details to life with a quote that reporters can use for context around your announcement and help paint a picture of how your news affects the given industry, customer base, and landscape.</p> \n     <p>Ideally, quotes will be from key stakeholders in your company including your executive team, project leads, or those directly impacted by your announcement. Quoting key figures and authorities underlines the importance of your development. The chosen quote should shape your narrative and emphasize the core of the announcement. Don't ask everyone in your office for a comment or feel compelled to quote all 25 people included in the acquisition -- pick one or two critical spokespeople and focus the quotes around their unique perspective.</p> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <h3>Rule 4: Provide valuable background information on the subject.</h3> \n   </div> \n   <div> \n    <div> \n     <p>In this last paragraph, keep in mind that the reader already has all of the vital details and information they need to file a story or spread the word.</p> \n     <p>It can be tempting to provide superfluous facts and tidbits about your company or the development of your announcement -- we sometimes think a piece of writing is lacking if it isn't drawn-out and just shy of being a novella. However, a press release <strong>needs to be helpful and concise</strong>.</p> \n     <p>Offer details here that strengthen your narrative, like creative or noteworthy ways your company developed the project or announcement at hand. Or, when applicable, comment on future implications of your announcement.</p> \n     <p><i>Another good way to add value to your press release is by using </i><a href=\"https://blog.justreachout.io/how-to-write-press-release/\"><i>newsjacking</i></a><i>. A process of relating your press release to something currently going on to make it more valuable to the journalist and reader.</i></p> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <h3>Rule 5: Summarize the \"who\" and the \"what\" in a boilerplate.</h3> \n   </div> \n   <div> \n    <div> \n     <p>Twitter is chock-full of reporters lamenting press releases or pitches that don't clearly explain what the company does or what the announcement is actually about, so instead of being the butt of a joke, make your release incredibly easy to reference.</p> \n     <p>Describe what your company does in clear, plain English, include a link to your company's homepage early on, and make your boilerplate succinct and straightforward. If you cite data, include a reference link for the data source, and make sure every name in the release has an associated title and company as well.</p> \n     <p>To keep yourself honest on this front, ask a friend or colleague to read the release without context and ask if they can easily and readily explain why the announcement matters, what your company does, and why the executives included are quoted. If the answer to any of those questions is no, get back to the drawing board.</p> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> </img>\n</div> \n<p>The key to keeping your PR strategy new school is forgetting preconceived notions of what public relations is and instead focusing on creating highly remarkable content. Traditional press releases can still be really valuable when executed well, so instead of ditching releases as a tactic, give them a modern makeover to make them more useful for your marketing.</p> \n<p>Think about how you've used <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/pr-and-inbound-marketing\">inbound methods to transform your marketing strategies</a> to be more personalized, approachable, and build relationships. Those same principles apply to your PR strategy: Create content to craft your own story and use tactful outreach to get reporters and analysts familiar with your brand.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Press Release Examples</h2> \n<p>Many people think press releases have to be chock full of buzzwords and branded terms. \"Big data,\" anyone? Five-syllable words you have to look up on Thesaurus.com? Quotes from every executive on the planet that go on for pages? We've seen it all. Unfortunately, so have reporters -- and they are <em>not</em> fans.</p> \n<p>Instead of stuffing your next release with industry jargon, take a page out of our book (okay fine, ebook), <em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/newsworthy-guide-to-inbound-public-relations\">The Newsworthy Guide to Inbound Public Relations</a></em>, and brainstorm some creative approaches for your next announcement. Can you include new data? A remarkable graphic or video? A shareable SlideShare? If so, a creative angle can help carry your content and increase the likelihood of social sharing.</p> \n<p>Now, to get you thinking on the right track, take a look at some creative press release examples below, the type of news each one is reporting on, and what makes the release unique:</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.skoda-press.be/wrc-spain-skoda-teams-with-trouble-free-run-kopecky-second-and-nordgren-fourth-in-wrc-2\">ŠKODA at the World Rally Championship</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of press release: Event</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/skoda-press-release-example.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Event press release by Skoda, showing a picture of the company's green racing car\" /></p> \n<p>Škoda, a car manufacturer based in the Czech Republic, recently showed off its sponsored racing team in two big places: at the 2017 World Rally Championship, and in a sleek, image-based press release reporting on the event.</p> \n<p>The news release, shown above, doesn't have any trouble aligning the look and feel of the Škoda brand with the press release itself -- which is a crucial aspect of any company's press content. The release opens with a large feature image of one of its vehicles in the same vibrant green that covers the business's website. The press release also begins with three helpful bullet points summarizing the news for readers, and ends the release with a couple of captioned actions shots to give reporters more context around the event.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RZj-hF2f0s\">ScribbleLive Acquires New Company</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of press release: Acquisition</h4> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 380px; min-width: 256px;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 59.38%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RZj-hF2f0s?ecver=1\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Yes, a video press release! This news item from ScribbleLive gave reporters nearly everything they'd need to republish this story, all in a thorough two-minute video about the company's latest acquisition.</p> \n<p>ScribbleLive opens the video press release above with the company's logo and a clear header stating the news. This allowed the company's CEO to jump right into his commentary on the acquisition, giving reporters plenty of quotable material on the state of the industry and why this merger was so important to them.</p> \n<p>The press release also segments the video the same way a written press release would, breaking up the CEO's commentary by the question he's answering. This makes it easy for viewers to jump through the video and find the information they're most interested in hearing about.</p> \n<p>And, being on YouTube, a press release in this format allows reporters to embed the news content directly on their site, making ScribbleLive's news that much easier to share.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://about.peapod.com/peapod-officially-opens-new-headquarters-in-chicago\">Peapod's New Headquarters</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of press release: Opening a new office</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/peapod-press-release-example.png\" alt=\"Press release by Peapod reporting on the company's new headquarters in Chicago\" /></p> \n<p>When you open a new headquarters, it can be hard to figure out what to say. People just want to get a look at the new digs! In the above press release by Peapod, an online grocery service, the company puts photos of its new office right at the top, immediately showing readers what makes this news so significant for Peapod.</p> \n<p>The release even singles out a quote by the Mayor of Chicago just below the headline, hinting to reporters who are writing about Peapod's new HQ that this is the remark Peapod is most interested in sharing with readers.</p> \n<p>Check out the boilerplate text at the bottom of the above press release. \"About [company]\" text can too easily blend in with the actual news text, making the piece seem longer than it really is. By isolating this copy in a dark gray box, Peapod provides a smoother reading experience and ensures the story itself doesn't get lost in an intimidatingly long wall of text.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/inbound-2018-product-announcements\">HubSpot's New Product Announcements</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of press release: New product launches</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/INBOUND%20Announcements-1.png\" alt=\"Product launch press release by HubSpot showing pricing information on each new product\" /></p> \n<p>When you're launching products or services, the information is often best expressed in written form.

Once you're finished with production, it'll be time to focus on distribution.</p> \n<p>Of course, we're all familiar with the traditional distribution levers we can pull, which include publishing the press release on our website/blog, as well as sharing the press release with our followers/subscribers via social media and email. But for ensuring a press release gets the maximum amount of distribution possible, here are some tips you can follow.</p> \n<h3>1. Reach out to specific journalists.</h3> \n<p>Instead of blasting a press release out to every journalist you can find an email address for, focus on a few journalists who have experience covering your industry (and company, hopefully) and send them personalized messages. Connect the dots. Show why what <em>you</em> wrote connects to what <em>they</em> write.</p> \n<h3>2. Don't be afraid to go offline.</h3> \n<p>Most journalists have mountains of emails (and press releases) to sort through. Try sending your release through snail mail or another offline channel to differentiate yourself.</p> \n<h3>3. Send the release to top journalists the day before.</h3> \n<p>Give journalists some time to craft a story around your press release by sending it to them -- under embargo -- the day before it officially goes live. (FYI \"under embargo\" just means they aren't allowed to share the information in the press release until the time you specify.)</p> \n<h3>4. To avoid competition, don't publish your release on the hour.</h3> \n<p>If you're publishing your press release on a distribution service like PR Newswire or Business Wire, avoid publishing it on the hour (e.g., 1 p.m., or 3 p.m., or 5 p.m.). The reason? Most companies schedule their releases to go out on the hour, which means if your release goes out on the hour too, it's more likely to get lost in the shuffle. Instead, try going with a more distinct time (e.g., 1:12 p.m., or 3:18 p.m., or 5:22 p.m.).</p> \n<h3>5. Share your media coverage.</h3> \n<p>If all goes according to plan, and your press release gets picked up by the media, your job still isn't finished. To keep the buzz going, you can release a \"second wave\" of distribution by sharing the specific stories that news outlets write based on your press release.</p> \n<div> \n <a class=\"close\"> </a> \n</div> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in November 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness. </em></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpress-release-template-ht&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:35:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/press-release-example-hubspot.png","linkMd5":"e521ad147ee0dd8dec92fa53f3b1e06c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-16-654_4ca3cbd1c3e567a5.webp","destWidth":651,"destHeight":645,"sourceBytes":264604,"destBytes":264604,"author":"hfleishman@hubspot.com (Hannah Fleishman)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/press-release-example-hubspot.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-16-654_4ca3cbd1c3e567a5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/press-release-example-hubspot.png?width=347&name=press-release-example-hubspot.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-23-461_f1c35088261ceb29.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/skoda-press-release-example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-24-732_560c553f99f0dba6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/peapod-press-release-example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-21-223_c57697bd9abf592d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/INBOUND%20Announcements-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-19-910_f75ff2f052c5581e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpress-release-template-ht&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn22@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-29-551_269056dc720495f5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336424},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How Facebook Ads Have Evolved [+What This Means for Marketers]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/history-facebook-adtips-slideshare","description":"<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\"><span>recent study from Statista</span></a>, Facebook has an estimated <em>2.7 billion</em> monthly active users worldwide, including roughly <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/408971/number-of-us-facebook-users/\"><span>two-thirds</span></a> of the US population. There's no social media platform more prominent or ubiquitous. No other online destination offers you more potential exposure to prospects.</p> \n<p>A well-maintained Facebook presence is central to many — if not most — companies' social media strategies. It's a key factor in processes like conducting outreach, projecting legitimacy, generating interest, and driving traffic to other content and company resources.</p> \n<p>One avenue businesses can leverage to make effective use of Facebook as a marketing tool is paid advertisements — a format that has moved through several iterations over the years.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll get a timeline of some of the most important, interesting milestones in Facebook ads' evolution, a picture of what the future might hold for the medium, and what this all means for marketers.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>The History of Facebook Ads</h2> \n<h3><strong>2004:</strong> Facebook first starts generating ad revenue with its \"Flyers\" project.</h3> \n<p>Roughly two months after Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin launched Facebook in February 2004, the two took some minor steps to monetize the platform — just enough for a small financial cushion to help while the company got off the ground.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Zuckerberg said in an <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/3/1/facebook-expands-beyond-harvard-harvard-students/?print=1#\"><span>interview with the Harvard Crimson</span></a> shortly after the platform went live, \"It might be nice to get some ads going to offset the cost of the servers.\"</p> \n<p>That April, Facebook started selling bits and pieces of ad space to companies promoting moving services, T-Shirts, job listings, and other offerings for students.</p> \n<p>The ads themselves weren't particularly sophisticated, and the founders didn't have much of a firm grasp on digital advertising. Still, the project represented a milestone in the history of Facebook advertising.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KaQQyE-Ys9j2WvSYZaG3QEwNNg2ApGI5j1Sp11EJoMVwxZvaKlVuKx9Jlp1M5ch8wl7r_rAl4mnFvbd9y_E9zV4oBHgyvtRGQQ_AB3GeSke7IbF_3JLsSQEkQxzTU6tRztEOSXXf\" width=\"135\" height=\"377\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"The history of Facebook Ads flyers\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/facebook/facebook-advertising-work-01436933\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source: Business 2 Community</a></p> \n<p>It was the first time the platform tried to make money from the platform through ad sales. Unrefined and seemingly uncoordinated as it might have been, the Flyers project still helped keep the platform afloat during its early days and warrants a mention on this timeline.</p> \n<h3><strong>2007:</strong> Facebook officially launches its Facebook Ads platform.</h3> \n<p>Some three years after Facebook's initial launch, the company introduced a large-scale, official ads program to the platform. It gave <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/24422/the-ultimate-facebook-marketing-cheat-sheet.aspx?_ga=2.101869377.1529852439.1597866496-1371271315.1597866496\"><span>businesses the space to create individual profiles</span></a> — just like standard users — to post content, share photos, and engage with Facebook users.</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2007/11/facebook-unveils-facebook-ads/\"><span>Zuckerberg put it,</span></a> \"The core of every user’s experience on Facebook is their page, and that’s where businesses are going to start as well...The first thing<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-facebook-business-page-ht?_ga=2.96149980.1529852439.1597866496-1371271315.1597866496\"><span> businesses can do is design a page</span></a> to craft the exact experience they want people to see.\"</p> \n<p>The new program also introduced \"Social Ads\" — ads that combined social actions from a user's friends, like a recent purchase or review of a business, with an advertiser’s message.</p> \n<p>This allowed advertisers to deliver more specific, targeted ads to users that included information from their friends.

For the last hundred years, media has been pushed out to people, but now marketers are going to be a part of the conversation.\"</p> \n<h3><strong>2011:</strong> Facebook launches its desktop ad program called \"Sponsored Stories.\"</h3> \n<p>In 2011, Facebook introduced its \"Sponsored Stories\" project — a program that placed paid advertisements directly on users' news feeds. Initially, the company pledged to only show users just one sponsored story on their news feeds per day. Those stories also stemmed solely from friends or pages users already liked.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OUr30oEzqMjcAN7_5bwQg8l9FXwo7Mvuy0NfllwpGVwLCycs9iB_JfhC1YzM_J-nPs7F-LsCXRXyMn2Lztrb9AiOtZVuDjwXktmR5l6JTlKiGj2A4sBRQQd2xEPtSIJnoAFoz-y-\" width=\"568\" height=\"321\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"The history of Facebook Ads sponsored stories\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/sponsored-stories-news-feed/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source: Mashable</a></p> \n<p>As a <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2011/01/26/technology/facebook_sponsored_stories/index.htm\"><span>product manager from Facebook described it</span></a>, \"Anything that one of your friends is seeing as a sponsored story which features some of your content is actually something they would have already seen in their news feed. A sponsored story never goes to somebody who is not one of your friends.\"</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iP2v0SRTqV--RoX9P-m43LQCOtOrtZFqcsSMRsRAnWjKl8u8B_ri8FF24l55gATYcYyIBqx3XgoQunz-A941qhtIGfpujBITYF2qdGpU5cnWvq_P1b8IlkmNaSym44KbfK8w726t\" width=\"624\" height=\"637\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"The history of Facebook Ads sponsored stories 2\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/sponsored-stories-news-feed/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source: TechCrunch</a></p> \n<p>Though it was impossible for users to opt-out of the program entirely, they still had the option to close out individual ads. \"Sponsored Stories\" certainly rubbed some users the wrong way, but advertisers saw it as a big win. Finally, they had the space to display their ads directly in the mix of social content and consumers' news feeds — a wildly valuable stretch of virtual real estate.</p> \n<h3>2012: Facebook launches its mobile ads program.</h3> \n<p>Up until 2012, Facebook's mobile app didn't actually make money. It didn't feature ads, and the move to incorporate them was considered a risky play. Consumers weren't exactly thrilled with the idea of having ads take up space on their mobile feeds.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/o5zobWqOJyb8XZz-VrRwd-7hnRZQB7nMiFwArQTDar0QGKo5MOPIfKQeV04N4tsUh4jBgTT57-75wzYTcA3NVv8jok5tt7N4XSEDTIqz5uka_YkI1jSCIbMel8SBl8L3S6MRh4-Q\" width=\"399\" height=\"471\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"The history of Facebook Ads mobile\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/29/facebooks-mobile-ads/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source: VentureBeat</a></p> \n<p>Facebook opted to subtly ease advertisements into users' feeds. Its mobile ads plan borrowed heavily from the desktop platform's \"Sponsored Story\" strategy — seamlessly blending in paid promotional content and having it look like standard statuses or other user-generated content.</p> \n<p>The company's mobile advertising strategy aimed to make ads as discreet as possible. It provided limited real estate to advertisers, pressing businesses to create engaging, interesting content to capture consumer attention within tight confines. The strategy ultimately proved successful and further drove advertisers' collective need to optimize for mobile.</p> \n<h3>2014: Facebook rolls out its three-level advertising campaign structure, offering \"campaigns\" and \"ad sets\" — on top of standard ads.</h3> \n<p>In March 2014, Facebook introduced its new ad structure. Until that point, the platform's campaign structure consisted of two levels: campaigns and ads.</p> \n<p>Campaigns — the overarching plans that correspond to specific advertising objectives — were designed to help users optimize, and measure results of individual ads. With this new development in Facebook advertising's evolution, a buffer was put between those two levels.</p> \n<p>Ad sets — subsets of a campaign that could feature their own budgets and target separate audience segments — were introduced. Those sets gave advertisers a new level of structure for honing in on, best appealing to, and better understanding demographics of particular interest.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0Bj6_lqmhyJRGBGpBfbZNmi_l7UcL0JF01hXY0UmYeYP-GgVamSkbdx69EioVRB2P8rtb3yqIfzGeGHpYji5cNkhhqBHz7Al9Fha-FwSnKtME-teccDUqpfx8jq_4EbjBdkeNqKJ\" width=\"619\" height=\"648\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"The history of Facebook Ads ad set\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-campaign-structure\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source: Facebook</a></p> \n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-campaign-structure\"><span>Facebook press release</span></a>, the program was designed to \"make it easier for advertisers of every size to organize, optimize and measure their ads.\" It was a game-changing milestone for the platform — one that made its advertising infrastructure more thoughtfully regimented and easier to navigate.</p> \n<h3>2016: Facebook introduces bots to its Messenger platform.</h3> \n<p>In 2016, Facebook made a push to capitalize on the tremendous advertising potential of its siloed mobile messaging function. One of the ways the company looked to take advantage of the system was through the incorporation of chatbots. Facebook offered businesses two paths for bot incorporation — \"Sponsored Messages\" and \"Click-to-Messenger\" ads.</p> \n<p>\"Sponsored Messages\" are ads that appear directly in a user's Messenger inbox — ones that allow users to automatically communicate with a chatbot by clicking them.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/h_TTzhP3LPmx8rr7E6rCNYZODiIv6lOoMJQ6-dlYbQ_E2nDa0EdlKKnxHDBc2slDb5oQ_SrUy4dYUdxe7kOBlW_kfksWQyl5FpXMr0szKOtX7GcTLxMtgb8NMHr0ZpMX2qT4qAzA\" width=\"624\" height=\"547\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"The history of Facebook Ads chatbot\"></span><span style=\"border: none;\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://botscrew.com/blog/facebook-ads-chatbots/\"><em>Image Source: BotsCrew</em></a></span></p> \n<p>\"Click-to-Messenger\" ads leverage CTAs to place ads in users' Messenger inboxes. A business will draw users in with some sort of incentive — like a discount or piece of content — on the original Facebook platform and automatically send them a message via chatbot once they click on the offer.</p> \n<h3>2018-2020: Facebook expands its ad formats, featuring eight separate advertising options.</h3> \n<p>Over its history, Facebook has consistently expanded its available advertising formats, aiming to effectively monetize the platform without compromising user experience. As of 2020, the company offers eight different <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/ad-formats?ref=ads_guide\"><span>advertising options</span></a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/photo-ad-format\"><span>Photo</span></a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video\"><span>Video</span></a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/stories-ad-format\"><span>Stories</span></a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/messenger-ads\"><span>Messenger</span></a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/Carousel-ad-format\"><span>Carousel</span></a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/slideshow-ad-format\"><span>Slideshow</span></a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/collection\"><span>Collection</span></a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/playable-ad-format\"><span>Playable Content</span></a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>As time goes on, you should expect to see this list expand and the nature of mediums it covers shift and progress. New technology and trends will bring new formats to explore and familiar processes to refine.</p> \n<h2>The Future of Facebook Advertising</h2> \n<p>If there's anything to learn from Facebook advertising's evolution, it's that the processes and practices behind the concept will never remain stagnant. Mark Zuckerberg will never look at the platform's advertising infrastructure and say, <em>\"Yeah, I think we nailed it. We'll never need to change any of this ever again.\"</em></p> \n<p>Advertising on Facebook will continue to evolve and adapt as new ad formats emerge, privacy and data regulations loosen or constrict, its user base changes, and social media trends come and go. There are too many factors at play to expect anything but constant, likely significant changes in the practice as time goes on.</p> \n<p>So, what can marketers take away from this article? Is there any recurring theme underlying success across every phase of Facebook advertising's evolution?</p> \n<p>As Facebook advertising has progressed, the companies that thrived in every stage were the ones that shared high-quality, engaging content that wasn't too abrasive.</p> \n<p>Consumers aren't using the platform because they want to see ads. That's why the content you share on the platform has to come across as natural, interesting, and not too jarring.</p> \n<p>If you prioritize producing and sharing valuable, interesting advertisements that won't overwhelm or frustrate your target audience, you'll put yourself in the best position possible to thrive as Facebook advertising continues to progress.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhistory-facebook-adtips-slideshare&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KaQQyE-Ys9j2WvSYZaG3QEwNNg2ApGI5j1Sp11EJoMVwxZvaKlVuKx9Jlp1M5ch8wl7r_rAl4mnFvbd9y_E9zV4oBHgyvtRGQQ_AB3GeSke7IbF_3JLsSQEkQxzTU6tRztEOSXXf","linkMd5":"7a9a301cab5ea9795385268b1530fcbf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-16-830_0721b824a88fb997.webp","destWidth":135,"destHeight":377,"sourceBytes":33865,"destBytes":13422,"author":"jfuchs@hubspot.com (Jay Fuchs)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KaQQyE-Ys9j2WvSYZaG3QEwNNg2ApGI5j1Sp11EJoMVwxZvaKlVuKx9Jlp1M5ch8wl7r_rAl4mnFvbd9y_E9zV4oBHgyvtRGQQ_AB3GeSke7IbF_3JLsSQEkQxzTU6tRztEOSXXf":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-16-830_0721b824a88fb997.webp","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7pR1YN_yXBYEn-DC3XucEY343fvoVrL8dgms9LIppaqb14yyZtWEeSAxB88N6G3wkh-YRRA6MdT8RUfWZ4R_wMbLWVnwsbuYt-tkdg2w7Aydm_EQRFTrLvL0Zl65lKtU8aZKb3m7":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn47@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-22-900_2a452e31693c7341.webp","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OUr30oEzqMjcAN7_5bwQg8l9FXwo7Mvuy0NfllwpGVwLCycs9iB_JfhC1YzM_J-nPs7F-LsCXRXyMn2Lztrb9AiOtZVuDjwXktmR5l6JTlKiGj2A4sBRQQd2xEPtSIJnoAFoz-y-":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn61@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-23-798_5abaa021b61c517e.webp","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iP2v0SRTqV--RoX9P-m43LQCOtOrtZFqcsSMRsRAnWjKl8u8B_ri8FF24l55gATYcYyIBqx3XgoQunz-A941qhtIGfpujBITYF2qdGpU5cnWvq_P1b8IlkmNaSym44KbfK8w726t":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn98@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-29-608_64208534b8abd43d.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/o5zobWqOJyb8XZz-VrRwd-7hnRZQB7nMiFwArQTDar0QGKo5MOPIfKQeV04N4tsUh4jBgTT57-75wzYTcA3NVv8jok5tt7N4XSEDTIqz5uka_YkI1jSCIbMel8SBl8L3S6MRh4-Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-23-362_29d2972e1d2141e1.webp","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0Bj6_lqmhyJRGBGpBfbZNmi_l7UcL0JF01hXY0UmYeYP-GgVamSkbdx69EioVRB2P8rtb3yqIfzGeGHpYji5cNkhhqBHz7Al9Fha-FwSnKtME-teccDUqpfx8jq_4EbjBdkeNqKJ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn53@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-25-670_9e00bf44a4036799.webp","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/h_TTzhP3LPmx8rr7E6rCNYZODiIv6lOoMJQ6-dlYbQ_E2nDa0EdlKKnxHDBc2slDb5oQ_SrUy4dYUdxe7kOBlW_kfksWQyl5FpXMr0szKOtX7GcTLxMtgb8NMHr0ZpMX2qT4qAzA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-27-717_ab0a16b42880a5fc.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhistory-facebook-adtips-slideshare&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-19-925_46bba680d512efd3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336422},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How to Make Digital Credentials Your Most Impactful Marketing Tool","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-credentials","description":"<p>Marketing can have an enormous, positive impact on both revenue and brand recognition. Which is why organizations spend so much time, energy, and resources trying to reach their target audience.</p> \n<p>And yet, from billboard ads and radio slots to the roughly <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/\">300 billion</a> emails sent each day, it's hard to boost your brand amidst all the noise.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there are innovative ways to cut through the crowded market and build brand awareness: and one of those opportunities is through <a href=\"https://resources.credly.com/what-is-a-dc-infographic\">digital credentials</a>.</p> \n<p>Digital credentials have emerged as an impactful marketing tool across a variety of industries including corporate training, associations, professional development and certifications, and higher education. If your organization issues digital credentials, there are several things you can do to make the most of their marketing power.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll cover four areas where incorporating digital badges can help your brand stand out.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Social</h3> \n<p>With over <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2019/01/30/digital-trends-2019-every-single-stat-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet/\">3.4 billion</a> active users, there's no denying social media is a modern marketing powerhouse. If your brand doesn't already have a social strategy in place, you're potentially losing out on the opportunity to engage with <em>millions</em> of customers.</p> \n<p>Incorporating digital credentials into your social media strategy can drive brand awareness, increase engagement with the individuals who earn your badges, and strengthen the reputation of your company online.</p> \n<p>To incorporate digital credentials, try using keywords and hashtags to search for individuals sharing your digital credentials online and interact with them — give them a \"Like\", a re-tweet, or congratulate them on their achievement. You'll build stronger connections and create new engagement opportunities with your badge earners.</p> \n<p>For instance, anyone who's earned a HubSpot certification could post it on their LinkedIn, like the example below:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png?width=427&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 427px;\" width=\"427\">\n</div> \n<p>Connecting with these users over social media in a meaningful way provides an opportunity for every single one of them to become an evangelist for your brand.</p> \n<p>Another way to leverage digital credentials in this way is for employees to share their certifications socially. Think of this as employees promoting company news or recent awards. By sharing achievements on their social channels, your employees are promoting your brand among users you may not have had the chance to get in front of otherwise.</p> \n<h3>2. Email</h3> \n<p>We've already established there is an inordinate number of emails exchanged each day, which means the average person receives multiple emails every hour. Even so, email marketing is still one of the most important and effective ways for your business to connect with customers and build meaningful relationships.</p> \n<p>Since your team is sending emails to people outside your organization, putting digital credentials in employee email signatures drives brand awareness and validation from the moment an email is opened. When your employees' certifications are on display, they work alongside your company logo to reinforce your brand every time an email is sent, forwarded, or replied to.</p> \n<p>Likewise, encourage your external badge earners to add digital credentials to their professional email signatures, too. Credentials help them establish credibility from the moment they hit \"Send\", allows email recipients to instantly verify the digital badge, and helps them learn more about your products and organization in the process.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png?width=381&amp;name=Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Article_Email Example\" width=\"381\" style=\"width: 381px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Online</h3> \n<p>As a marketer, driving quality traffic to your company's site is a core focus. It's the reason there's such importance placed on including backlinks to a website in emails, social media posts, and content.</p> \n<p>The beauty of digital credentials is they're meant to be seen and shared. Developing a dedicated landing page for your digital credentials where potential earners can see the badge associated with the skill is a great way to get visibility for your credentials and is a great place for new earners to start the trial or purchase process. The more people visiting the page, the more recognition you'll have for your initiative.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png?width=1172&amp;name=Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Example_Online Landing Page\" width=\"1172\" style=\"width: 1172px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Events</h3> \n<p>Events are a critical marketing initiative because they offer the opportunity to build relationships with key customers and prospects. In an increasingly digital world, many marketers believe face-to-face interactions at events are crucial to generating pipeline. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.marketingcharts.com/customer-centric/lead-generation-and-management-82291\">68% of B2B marketers</a> agree that live events help generate the most leads.</p> \n<p>Since events place a significant focus on generating brand awareness in a sea of industry solutions, you have to ensure your brand stays top-of-mind for attendees.</p> \n<p>Whether it's a job fair or conference, including digital badges at your booth is a great way to encourage conversation and spark questions about your organization's products and programs, as well as your commitment to employee development.</p> \n<p>The visual representation of competencies allows key audiences to see your expertise before they even engage with your team.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png?width=541&amp;name=Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png\" alt=\"Hubspot Example_Event Flyer\" width=\"541\" style=\"width: 541px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Today, having a great product or service is only half the battle. Making sure people know about your organization and how to engage with it is a huge challenge, but also a huge part of brand success. Creating brand awareness won't happen overnight. Using these ideas can help carve out your place in the market and help your brand stand out in no time.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-credentials&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ce7b89a71f8f29571df96c8ba23cf23a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Adam Masur","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png?width=427&name=How%20to%20Make%20Digital%20Credentials%20Your%20Most%20Impactful%20Marketing%20Tool.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn8@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-27-821_f2f3e8a420d8da75.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png?width=381&name=Hubspot%20Article_Email%20Example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn41@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-21-982_83fedb2362a96f80.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png?width=1172&name=Hubspot%20Example_Online%20Landing%20Page.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn29@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-26-358_05965a407430c494.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png?width=541&name=Hubspot%20Example_Event%20Flyer.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn2@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-28-712_ca32349614f22d1f.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdigital-credentials&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn81@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-23-037_8c978c1062e98dd3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336432},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How to Design Content Remarketing Campaigns That Actually Work","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns","description":"<p>You know content marketing works, so you've been plugging away at blog posts, ebooks, and other valuable, educational content for your potential customers.</p> \n<p>And people come -- they find your content in search results and in their social media feeds.

It's not always because they're not interested in your message -- so how do you recapture those viewers who left your site?</p> \n<p>Recapturing audience attention to turn lookers into leads is an effective marketing tactic, and if you're not doing it, you're leaving money on the table.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Let me outline for you the sections I'm going to cover in this post:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns#what-is-remarketing\">What the Heck is Remarketing?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns#what-is-gdn\">What Is the Google Display Network?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns#campaign-examples\">Remarketing Campaign Examples</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns#set-up-remarketing-campaign\">How to Set Up a Remarketing Campaign</a></li> \n</ol> \n<a></a> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What the Heck Is Remarketing?</h2> \n <p>At its core, remarketing is the process of tagging your site visitors and targeting them with content after they leave your site in an effort to reengage them and bring them back to your site.</p> \n</div> \n<p>Remarketing gives you the opportunity to appear in front of people who have already expressed an interest in your website. They could be checking their email, reading the news, watching a YouTube video… and there you are, with something new and awesome to show them. It could be a reminder to complete an action they had started, or a new piece of content to further a buying decision, and so on.</p> \n<p>Remarketing provides the opportunity to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Turn bounced website visitors into leads.</li> \n <li>Increase brand recall (and thus increase branded searches).</li> \n <li>Increase repeat visitor rates and engagement.</li> \n <li>Increase the effectiveness of search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketing.</li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 650px;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811089655-png/Remarketing1.png?width=650&amp;name=Remarketing1.png\" width=\"650\" alt=\"a graphic illustrating all the users who visited your website vs. bringing them back to your website\" /></p> \n<p>A common stat in the industry is that <strong>96% of people who visit a website leave without completing the action the marketer would have liked them to take.</strong> Remarketing gives you a second chance to make that first impression (and even a third, and a fourth). We can't afford to be forgettable -- we have to make our content more <em>sticky</em>.</p> \n<p>Alright, so we understand both the problem and the opportunity. Now, let's dive into the solution.&nbsp;You're going to learn how to use remarketing strategies with the Google Display Network to dramatically increase the effectiveness of your inbound marketing efforts.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>What Is the Google Display Network?</strong></h2> \n<p>The Google Display Network is a group of websites where your Google display (banner) ads can appear. <br><br>More than 2 million sites are in the network, including heavily trafficked ones such as YouTube. Google estimates that the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/117120?hl=en\">GDN can reach 90% of people on the internet</a>. <br><br>Who you reach and how often will depend on your ad targeting (more on that later).</br></br></br></br></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809803507-png/Remarketing2.png?width=600&amp;name=Remarketing2.png\" alt=\"graphic that shows google display network's reach in the US across millions of sites, videos, and devices including LinkedIn, CNN, lastfm, eHow, xe, howstuffworks, The New York Times, YouTube, Blogger, Gmail, Google Finance, and Google maps\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Remarking Campaign Examples</strong></h2> \n<p>To further underscore the opportunity that remarketing has to offer, there are some really cool campaign types that you can dig into.</p> \n<h3>Online Activity</h3> \n<p>By far the most common remarketing tactic is creating an audience based on their behavior on your website. Your options here are virtually endless — with parameters such as by number of page views (indicating a high level of interest) or by which pages viewed (indicating intent).</p> \n<p>Here are some ideas for using this type of campaign:</p> \n<h4>Targeting by Buyer's Journey Stage</h4> \n<p>Your blog posts are earlier in the buyer's journey than other pages on your site. That means you'd match their intent with an ad that moves them further down their journey rather than one that sells. Targeting by topic or category-say you run a bakery. Why run general ads to audiences that landed on your wedding-related content? Instead, you'd target them with more personalized ads around wedding cakes and desserts.</p> \n<h4>Targeting by Intent</h4> \n<p>Aside from just topic, there's a lot you can learn from your audience's site behavior. For example, visiting a product page indicates interest, but not making it to checkout could mean a price objection or other friction. This means you need to sweeten the deal in some way (like a promo or discount).</p> \n<h4>Past Purchases</h4> \n<p>You can also target those that did make it through your purchasing process and target them with ads to earn an upsell.</p> \n<h3><strong>YouTube TrueView</strong></h3> \n<p>The human race spends billions of hours every month watching YouTube ads. You may have your own YouTube content, but perhaps your viewing metrics aren’t quite as high as you’d like them to be, or perhaps your users have no idea you have interesting video content to share.</p> \n<p>Using <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/15/youtube-remarketing\">YouTube TrueView ads</a>, you can target your audiences as they are watching other videos on YouTube.</p> \n<p>Take the screenshot below, for example.&nbsp;I’m trying to watch a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle video and it’s showing me an ad for a tourism company in Italy. Why? Because I was planning a trip to Florence at the time I took this screenshot, and they’re remarketing to me.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811335425-png/Remarketing995.png?width=551&amp;name=Remarketing995.png\" width=\"551\" style=\"width: 551px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"image ad in youtube video\" /></p> \n<p>The cool thing about TrueView videos is that you only pay if people view your video content. There’s no cost if the person clicks on the “skip ad” button. If you’re creating video content, why wouldn’t you pay a few bucks to promote it?</p> \n<h3>Video Views</h3> \n<p>Speaking of YouTube, your visitors don't even need to make it to your website in order for you to retarget them. If you have a solid YouTube presence, you can create an audience based on video views. If someone watched one of your videos, you can create a display campaign that shows them your ads even beyond the YouTube platform.</p> \n<h3><strong>Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA)</strong></h3> \n<p>Here’s another interesting but advanced thing you can do. It’s a little complicated, but I promise it's awesome. It’s called Remarking Lists for Search Ads.</p> \n<p>RLSA lets you target people in your audiences with customized ads when they perform searches for specific keywords on Google.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809994192-png/Remarketing998.png?width=522&amp;name=Remarketing998.png\" width=\"522\" style=\"width: 522px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"graphic illustrating RLSA process: users visit your site, get added to your remarketing list, then you show them customized ads when they search on Google\" /></p> \n<p>Say, for example, someone visits your site. You tag them, and now they’re in one of your audiences.</p> \n<p>That person then searches for a competitor of yours. This probably means they’re doing some comparison shopping.</p> \n<p>Using RLSA, you can target that comparison shopper with a specific ad, like a 10% discount code or something similar. Knowing that the person visited specific pages on your site and is now performing specific searches, it’s possible to come up with very specific and compelling ad copy.</p> \n<h3>Bonus: Remarketing With Facebook</h3> \n<p>Noticeably absent from the GDN is Facebook, the other big player on the web, and that's because they have their own remarketing system through Facebook Custom Audiences.</p> \n<p>It works in much the same way — the difference being that ads are shown to users within the Facebook platform.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>How to Set Up a Remarketing Campaign With Google Ads</strong></h2> \n<p>Like I said earlier, using the GDN for remarketing gives you a great deal of reach. Generally, you can find your tagged site visitors on the network many times per day, several days per week, and across many different sites.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Define your audience.</strong></h3> \n<p>One of your first steps in remarketing is to define the specific audience(s) you want to remarket to. For example, you could create an audience for people who visited your blog or for people who visited specific pages on your website, like your pricing page. This will enable you to reach out to<em> just</em> those people with offers and messaging to suit their interests.</p> \n<p>To define an audience, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454064?hl=en\">create a new remarketing list</a> in Google Ad. Google will take care of setting all of the cookies; all<em> you</em> need to do is specify which website visitors to include or exclude from your audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809833607-png/Remarketing4.png?width=600&amp;name=Remarketing4.png\" alt=\"new remarketing list interface within google ads\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p>Segmenting different lists of users enables you to show different ads, depending on which section of your site they visited.</p> \n<p>A secondary benefit is that you can bid more aggressively to get more impressions and higher ad positions, and to get visitors to the higher value sections of your website. For example, your data might show that visitors to your pricing or product page are more valuable than your blog visitors.</p> \n<p>Another creative remarketing strategy for content marketers is to <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/02/09/how-to-create-adwords-audiences\">define audience categories</a> in Google Ads based on the different post categories in your blog. If you already have a ton of blog content that is classified by topic, leverage those existing classifications in your remarketing audience definition strategy.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Set audience membership duration.</strong></h3> \n<p>In remarketing, the audience membership duration is the number of days that you follow a user around with your ads. For example, if I set my audience membership duration to 60 days, then users who visit my site will see my ads for 60 days. You can test and tweak this number to see what's right for your audience.</p> \n<p>Ad fatigue is a real thing in every industry and across every medium: TV, radio, print … and, yes, display ads.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now, I'd like to address a concern I've heard from some fellow marketers: that overly aggressive remarketing will make your prospective customer feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;Let's look at a few facts and see just how \"creepy\" remarketing really is.</p> According to \n<a href=\"https://kenshoo.com/blog/retargeting-stats/\">Kenshoo</a>, retargeting can lift ad engagement rates up to 400%, 60% of consumers are neutral about the topic of retargeting ads, and 25% say they actually like them. \n<a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/97225536354/infographic-7-incredible-retargeting-ad-stats\">Wishpond</a> reports that the average click-through rate for retargeted ads is 10 times that of a regular display ad, and retargeting can lead to a 726% lift in site visitation after four weeks of exposure. \n<p>So, be bold!&nbsp;People visited your site for a reason, and past browsing history is among the strongest predictors of future purchasing intent.&nbsp;It’s worth testing out remarketing with relatively higher impression caps and membership durations and seeing what happens. <strong>A</strong><strong>s long as your offers and messaging are on target and you're providing value, it's not creepy.&nbsp;</strong>I would suggest:</p> \n<ul> \n <li class=\"normalCxSpMiddle\">Try setting your audience membership duration to an amount equal to 3x your average sale cycle length.</li> \n <li class=\"normalCxSpMiddle\">If it typically takes an average of one week to go from first touch to sale, set the<strong> audience membership duration to three weeks.</strong></li> \n <li class=\"normalCxSpMiddle\">Don’t worry too much about impression caps. (Remember, more impressions means higher conversion rates. Consider <strong style=\"font-size: inherit;\"><em>rotating though multiple ads per campaign</em></strong> to combat ad fatigue.)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>3. Create a killer ad.</strong></h3> \n<p>Now that we’ve talked about defining an audience to remarket to, let's focus on how to create killer remarketing ads.</p> \n<h4><strong>Understand Ad Formats on the GDN</strong></h4> \n<p>There are several different display ad formats on the Google Display Network, some of which are shown below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-display-ads-responsive-formats.jpg?width=600&amp;name=google-display-ads-responsive-formats.jpg\" alt=\"examples of google display ads responsive formats\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads\">Image Source</a><br><br /></br></img></p> \n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: table;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr style=\"height: 21px;\"> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">Type</td> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">Dimensions</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 21px;\"> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">Mobile</td> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">300x250, 320x50, 320x100, 250x250, 200x200</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr style=\"height: 21px;\"> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">Desktop</td> \n   <td style=\"height: 21px;\">300x250, 336x280, 728x90, 300x600, 160x600, 970x90, 468x60</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><br>Ad formats matter to marketers because of how the ad auction works. Different ad formats do not compete against each other for positioning, as shown in this screenshot:</br></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811230125-png/Remarketing9.png?width=600&amp;name=Remarketing9.png\" alt=\"example webpage with multiple display ads: shows that different ad formats do not compete against each other but same format ads still do\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<h4><strong>Write Copy That Resonates Emotionally</strong></h4> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/emotional-ads-work-best.htm\">neurosciencemarketing.com</a>, an emotional approach in advertising is nearly twice as effective as a rational approach. The same emotions that draw people to your content will drive people to click on your ads.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The key here is to create ads that resonate with users on an emotional level. Stay away from boring, plain, informational ads that look the same as every other ad out there. Instead, create ads that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emotion-marketing\">appeal to your audience on an emotional level</a>.</p> \n<p>Content marketers are uniquely qualified to become fabulous PPC marketers. Why?&nbsp;Because so much of the success and failure of PPC marketing relies on the creativity of your ads.</p> \n<p>For example,&nbsp;look at these ads for a search of “Big Data Solutions” -- the ads are essentially all the same:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 650px;\" title=\"Remarketing992\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811305370-png/Remarketing992.png?width=650&amp;name=Remarketing992.png\" width=\"650\" alt=\"ads for &quot;big data solutions&quot; where none of the competing advertisers have unique ad headlines\" /></p> \n<p>Content marketers, on the other hand, tend to have a few creative bones in their bodies. I call this a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/29/hacking-adwords\">Google Ads Jackpot</a>&nbsp;because it reminds me of hitting a row of lucky 7s in Vegas -- I just hit a Big Data Solutions jackpot! If you can come up with an emotionally charged, totally different and stand-out ad,&nbsp;you can blow away the competition.</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Perform ongoing CTR optimization.</strong></h3> \n<p>Google doesn’t make money by showing ads no one clicks on, so it makes sense for them to show ads that are more likely to get clicks. They use&nbsp;an algorithm called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/quality-score\">Quality Score</a>&nbsp;to determine which ads to show, what position each will display in, and how much to charge the advertiser for each ad click.</p> \n<p>To provide an incentive for advertisers to create great ads, they give out huge discounts for ads with high clickthrough rates… and dish out huge penalties for ads with low clickthrough rates.</p> \n<p>This all sounds good in theory, but how do you create an ad with high clickthrough rate?</p> \n<h4><strong>1. Send people to your high-value offers.&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<p>What should you be featuring in your image ads? The most common tactic is to simply promote your highest value offers, like a free trial of your product, a request for a demo, etc. This is my top-performing ad:&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809918942-png/Remarketing97.png?width=463&amp;name=Remarketing97.png\" alt=\"remarketing ad from wordstream with a puppy on it that says &quot;my dog ate my ppc! no more excuses for poor results&quot;\" width=\"463\" style=\"width: 463px; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Of course it has a cute puppy. How could it not? Make people&nbsp;love your ads, not dread them.</p> \n<h4><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Do a conversion path analysis.</strong></h4> \n<p>The goal here is to figure out which pages on your site, if visited during a user’s session, result in a much higher probability of the user converting to a lead or a sale. For example, the highest converting page on your site could be your product overview page.&nbsp;Come up with a list like this one and target those pages in your remarketing audience.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809918967-png/Remarketing98.png?width=444&amp;name=Remarketing98.png\" alt=\"excel spreadsheet showing different pages and their conversion rates, indicating the top converting pages are ideal for remarketing\" width=\"444\" style=\"width: 444px; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h4>3. Send people to your best content.</h4> \n<p>Check out this ad from my colleague <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/aimclear\">Marty Weintraub</a> at AimClear, which sends anyone who clicks to his PPC analyses.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" title=\"Remarketing99\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1808175089-png/Remarketing99.png?width=600&amp;name=Remarketing99.png\" alt=\"remarketing ad at the top of a page that says &quot;10 kevlar ppc analyses and process for a bulletproof account&quot;\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p>But how do you know what content to feature in your ads?</p> \n<h4><strong>4. Analyze social shares on your blog content. </strong></h4> \n<p>If you analyze your blog content, what you’ll usually find is that around 5% of your pages generate half of the shares on social media.</p> \n<p>For example, I analyzed all of the articles on one business blog over the last year and found that on average, a typical article gets several hundred shares on social media. However, the top 5% of articles gets tens of thousands of social shares.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, we found that the same stories that work well on social media also tend to do very well as featured content within ads.</p> \n<h3><strong>5. Get strategic with bid management.</strong></h3> \n<p>Now that you have remarketing audiences and ads down to a science, let's turn our attention to bid management strategies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Remember, in PPC marketing, you have to pay for each click. The advertiser specifies a maximum cost per click that they’re willing to pay, but the key here is not to buy every possible click.&nbsp;Rather, you want to be super picky and just cherry-pick the clicks that are the most relevant to your business. The way to do this is through bid management.</p> \n<p>It doesn’t make any sense to remarket ads to everyone in your audience. Why? Because not everyone who visits your website is a qualified buyer.</p> \n<p>With Google Ads, you can overlay user demographic information on top of your remarketing audiences to find the needles in the haystack. For example, someone from Zimbabwe could visit your site -- but they can't convert if you can't ship there.</p> \n<p>Here’s when it comes in handy to know a thing or two about your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\">target customer persona</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What are the ages?</li> \n <li>Parental status?</li> \n <li>Where do they live?</li> \n <li>Gender?</li> \n <li>What time do they search for your products?</li> \n <li>What is their income?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You can be very picky, and <em>just</em> bid for the people in your audience who also meet your demographic filters.</p> \n<p>You've done your research, you know your topic, you have something interesting and entertaining to say -- but sometimes you need that extra push. As individuals and brands have become publishers, the game has been upped big time. Competition is fierce.</p> \n<p>With remarketing, we at WordStream increased our repeat visitors by 50%, tripled our average time on site, and saw a huge increase in direct visits to our site.</p> \n<p>In short, content remarketing enabled us to maximize the value of every piece of content we put out. We were able to get each piece in front of the audience with the most intent, at the right time, and via the right channels.</p> \n<p>You can achieve this kind of success too with a killer remarketing campaign and the right advertising plan.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in October 2014 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdesign-content-remarketing-campaigns&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 20:30:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"db6f2d622208acfd36a8fd982db57de6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Larry Kim","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811089655-png/Remarketing1.png?width=650&name=Remarketing1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-22-972_7f9d6bef4c26dd7d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809803507-png/Remarketing2.png?width=600&name=Remarketing2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-23-762_a3b51dcf9b6a5942.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811335425-png/Remarketing995.png?width=551&name=Remarketing995.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn66@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-21-506_e0b8d834d22e645a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809994192-png/Remarketing998.png?width=522&name=Remarketing998.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-23-154_70e98a5efa6eb181.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809833607-png/Remarketing4.png?width=600&name=Remarketing4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn82@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-26-821_e6cabad0f0a4d023.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-display-ads-responsive-formats.jpg?width=600&name=google-display-ads-responsive-formats.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-21-766_6e97d8123a28fc27.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811230125-png/Remarketing9.png?width=600&name=Remarketing9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-21-421_bb594b382858491f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1811305370-png/Remarketing992.png?width=650&name=Remarketing992.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-21-280_515561343d895aeb.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809918942-png/Remarketing97.png?width=463&name=Remarketing97.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn61@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-24-927_d1cb5c874a3097ff.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1809918967-png/Remarketing98.png?width=444&name=Remarketing98.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-23-264_a7dfbc18e5136323.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1808175089-png/Remarketing99.png?width=600&name=Remarketing99.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn70@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-25-250_c6c0d33a392e7f64.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdesign-content-remarketing-campaigns&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn35@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-28-887_b7a9a25e68780be2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336428},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How to Set Up Automated Email Marketing Workflows (+ Examples)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-automation-examples","description":"<div class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\"> \n <p>Are your contacts going with the flow, or are they just sitting dormant in your marketing database? If you don't have any automated email workflows set up, your answer is probably the latter -- which means you're missing out on some&nbsp;major opportunities to nurture and engage your existing&nbsp;contacts.</p> \n <p>Did you know that&nbsp;marketing automation can lead <a href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/marketing-automation/\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">to a 14.5% increase in sales productivity</a>? </p> \n <p><a title=\"Lead nurturing emails\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/optimizing-lead-nurturing?_ga=2.207193875.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\">Lead nurturing campaigns</a> aren't the only type of <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">email marketing</a> automation you can use to get more out of your contacts database. Think about the contacts who are already your customers. Email automation can not only help you <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/lead-management\">convert leads into customers,</a> but it can also help you delight your existing customers and encourage activity like greater product adoption, upsells, evangelism, and additional purchases.&nbsp;</p> \n <p></p> Email marketing automation is useful because it eliminates small but time consuming tasks, such as preparing email lists, sending generic messages, or scheduling events manually. This allows marketers and salespeople more time to work on more productive projects or bigger deals. \n <p>Email marketing automation is centered around the workflow, which is essentially a blueprint of actions you're directing your automation software to take. Software can' t read minds, so one of the challenges is implementing a repeatable process that takes all use cases into account.</p> \n <h3>1. Identify who you're sending to.</h3> \n <p>Personalization is critical when it comes to email, and if your CRM is set up effectively, you'll be able to send automated emails to targeted segments of your database. It all comes down to the integrity of the data you've collected from your contacts and their behavior on your site and with your emails.</p> \n <p>First, know who you want to send to. An upsell campaign might go to existing customers who have not purchased a particular product yet. For another campaign, you might want to promote a new feature to a specific type of prospect who finds it most useful.</p> \n <p>Then, you want to translate the case you identified into criteria your software an understand. For the first example, you might use \"Lifecycle Stage = Customer\" and see if any of your custom properties can whittle that group down to only those who haven't purchased the product yet.</p> \n <p>For the second example, you'd need to determine if you have any properties that can segment the group you're looking for. It might be a property/field for job title, customer type, or buyer persona.</p> \n <p>Criteria can be as specific as the data you have in your CRM.</p> \n <h3>2. Determine your goal.</h3> \n <p>Your email marketing is only as good as your strategy, so ensure you know why you're contacting these individuals. Do you want them to buy something? Learn something? Do something?</p> \n <p>Once you know this, you can figure out the messaging you need to take them from where they're at to where you want them to go.</p> \n <p>You also have to plan for what happens when you succeed.</p> \n <p>For example, imagine a 10-email series to get prospects to request a consultation. Prospect A converts within the first email. If Prospect A continues to receive emails telling them to do what they've already done, they'll get frustrated. In HubSpot, if you define your goal, it will unenroll any contacts who meet the goal.</p> \n <p>If your software doesn't have this feature or you choose not to use it, you will need to consider this case as you build your workflow's logic.</p> \n <h3>3. Set enrollment criteria.</h3> \n <p>\"Enrollment criteria\" refers to the qualities that must be met for a contact to be entered into a workflow. You'll need to be intimately familiar with the types of data you have in your CRM (properties or fields) and be able to trust the accuracy of that data.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/2832391/hubfs/Automation/Workflows/adding-workflow-enrollment-criteria.gif?width=600&amp;name=adding-workflow-enrollment-criteria.gif\" alt=\"adding workflow enrollment criteria in hubspot\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <p>If you're using <a title=\"HubSpot's Workflows tool\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing-automation\">HubSpot Workflows</a>, for example, you can create personalized, automated email workflows that can get triggered in a number of different ways -- when a contact gets added to a list, submits a form on your website, clicks a link in an email, views a page on your blog, clicks on one of your ads, or becomes a marketing qualified lead.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>You can also set up email workflows based on any information you have about the contacts in your marketing database, such as page views, email or social media clicks, content downloads, contact properties, or any combination of these and more.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3>4. Identify the actions that must be taken.</h3> \n <p>If you were manually emailing these contacts, what would you do? Automation actions include the following and more:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Email sends</li> \n  <li>Time delays</li> \n  <li>If/then branching</li> \n  <li>CRM updates</li> \n </ul> \n <p>You'll need to map out the sequence of events according to \"actions\" that your software understands and specify when the actions need to be taken.</p> \n <h3>5. Create the necessary assets.</h3> \n <p>By this point, you know how many emails you want to send and the general messaging they should include. Before you begin creating your workflow, all assets should be created and loaded into the software.</p> \n <p>In HubSpot, automated emails must be specified as such in the \"email type\" prompt.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-type-automated.jpg?width=600&amp;name=email-type-automated.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;choose an email type&quot; prompt in hubspot with options: regular, automated, blog/rss\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>5. Implement the workflow logic and attach email assets.</h3> \n <p>Automation software works in an overly literal way, so think of your workflow as a blueprint that outlines each action in order, no matter how minuscule those actions seem.</p> \n <p>In HubSpot, you'd specify which actions to take in the \"choose an action\" window in the workflows tool.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-workflows-choose-an-action.jpg?width=426&amp;name=hubspot-workflows-choose-an-action.jpg\" alt=\"hubspot workflows choose an action prompt\" width=\"426\" style=\"width: 426px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>6. Check your setup and do a test if possible.</h3> \n <p>Some things to consider implementing into your workflow publishing process:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Looking at the list of enrolled contacts for errors</li> \n  <li>Checking that the number enrolled matches what you'd expect</li> \n  <li>Considering the workflow chart and use cases</li> \n  <li>Checking the the send settings</li> \n </ul> \n <p>In HubSpot, there's also a way to \"Test\" the workflow by receiving the emails all at once (but in order).</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-workflows-test.jpg?width=318&amp;name=hubspot-workflows-test.jpg\" alt=\"hubspot workflows test button\" width=\"318\" style=\"width: 318px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <p>This won't cover all cases but is still a best practice.</p> \n <h3>8. Set live and monitor progress.</h3> \n <p>Once you're happy with the workflow, set it live.</p> \n <p>Mistakes can happen, so monitor for anomalies. Don't be afraid to adjust as needed to resolve issues or improve performance.</p> \n <p>And&nbsp;that's just the beginning&nbsp;of what you can do with workflows.&nbsp;Workflows can also enable&nbsp;you to automate other actions <em>besides</em> email, such as setting or clearing a contact property value, updating a contact's lifecycle stage, adding/removing a contact from a list, and other administrative tasks that allow for more targeted, effective marketing to your prospects and customers.&nbsp;</p> \n <h2>13 Examples of Email Marketing Automation Workflows You Should Try</h2> \n <p>Now let's walk through some examples of automated email workflows you can set up to start getting more out of your contacts database and <a title=\"marketing automation tools\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing-automation\">marketing automation </a>tools.</p> \n <h3>1. Topic Workflows</h3> \n <h4>Main Triggers: Page Views or Content Offer Downloads</h4> \n <p>Create a workflow for each of the industry-related topics you create content about. So if, hypothetically, you're a unicorn breeder whose main content&nbsp;topics include unicorn diets, unicorn gear, and unicorn boarding, you could bucket your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-strategy-guide\">content marketing</a> offers (e.g. ebooks, webinars, kits, etc.) and blog posts by these topics, create an email workflow for each topic, and trigger the appropriate workflow when one of your contacts views a page or downloads an offer centered around that topic.</p> \n <p>You can trigger a content download workflow based on a form submission from a tool like HubSpot’s free conversion tool, <a href=\"http://hubs.ly/H05dT0b0\">HubSpot Marketing Free</a>. (HubSpot customers: You can <a href=\"http://marketingfree.hs-sites.com/knowledge/add-lead-flows-to-hubspot\">add Lead Flows, HubSpot's pop-up forms,&nbsp;as an add-on by following the instructions here</a>. To trigger an automated workflow in HubSpot, you can use the “Lead Flow Submission” option as the starting condition.)</p> \n <p>So if a contact downloaded your ebook called&nbsp;<em>10 Tips for a Balanced Unicorn Diet</em>, your \"unicorn diet\" workflow would be triggered, sending that contact other helpful content, like blog posts about unicorn dietary tips.</p> \n <h3>2. Blog Subscriber Welcome Workflow&nbsp;</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: Subscription to Your Blog</h4> \n <p>Give your brand new blog subscribers a nice, warm welcome with a blog welcome email. You can use this email to thank contacts for subscribing,&nbsp;remind them what they'll get out of reading your blog,&nbsp;review their subscription settings (and allow them to make adjustments), and promote your blog's best-performing articles or other offers.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-subscriber-welcome-emails-ht\">Get&nbsp;tips for creating a successful blog welcome email here</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-welcome-emails\">learn more about optimizing welcome emails here</a>.</p> \n <h3>3. New Customer Welcome/Training Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: Lifecycle Stage</h4> \n <p>While we're on the subject&nbsp;of warm welcomes, consider&nbsp;setting up a series of welcome emails when a contact converts into a paying customer, which you can trigger when a contact's lifecycle stage gets updated to \"customer.\"</p> \n <p>Not only is this a great way to&nbsp;kick off your new customer&nbsp;relationship on a positive note, but it can also keep&nbsp;your customers engaged after they buy. And if your product or service requires a little training on your customers' part, use this workflow as an opportunity to introduce helpful training materials on an incremental basis.</p> \n <h3>4. Engaged Contact/Evangelist Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Triggers: Visits, Clicks, or Form Submissions</h4> \n <p>Create a dynamic list (we call these Smart Lists in <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products\">HubSpot's Marketing Platform</a>) that automatically updates to include contacts who are really engaged with you. To create this list, use trigger criteria such as a high threshold of visits to your website, clicks on your emails&nbsp;or social media&nbsp;posts, or form submissions. Then create an email workflow to leverage this list as a way to encourage evangelism of your top content in social media.</p> \n <p>Because these contacts are highly engaged with you already, they're more apt to share your top content. You&nbsp;can&nbsp;also consider adding list criteria&nbsp;to pull in&nbsp;contacts with a certain number&nbsp;of Twitter followers so you can leverage the power of those social media influencers in your database.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3>5. Lead Nurturing Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: Multiple Top-of-the-Funnel Conversion Events&nbsp;</h4> \n <p>If a contact has&nbsp;downloaded&nbsp;several&nbsp;of your top-of-the-funnel marketing&nbsp;offers like ebooks and webinars, it might be a good sign they're ready for a little bit more. Set up workflows that help to advance these contacts further down the&nbsp;funnel.</p> \n <p>If the contact is a lead, try sending them emails containing more middle-of-the-funnel content that might upgrade them to a marketing qualified lead (MQL) or an opportunity in your sales process. This workflow could include content and web pages you've identified from an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/attribution-reports-definition\">attribution report</a>&nbsp;analysis as influential in converting leads into customers -- perhaps content like customer success stories/case studies, free trial offers, or product demos.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><em>(Bonus: If you're using <a title=\"HubSpot's Workflows\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing-automation\">HubSpot's Workflows</a>, you could set up a condition that automatically upgrades these leads to a new lifecycle stage as a result!)</em></p> \n <h3>6. Internal Sales Rep Notification Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Triggers: Bottom-of-the-Funnel Page Views/Conversion Events</h4> \n <p>On any given website, there&nbsp;are certain page visits and conversion events that indicate product interest more so than others. First, identify these pages and conversion events using an <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/analytics\">attribution reporting tool like HubSpot's</a>. You’ll notice that, more often than not, the pages you unearth will be your pricing page, your product pages, etc. -- pages contacts view when they're truly evaluating your products or services.</p> \n <p>Use workflows here to trigger an&nbsp;internal email notification to your sales rep informing them of these high-value activities. Using personalization, give the rep all the information they need about the lead in question,&nbsp;including&nbsp;relevant mid- and bottom-of-the-funnel content that they can send to the lead in their outreach email. This allows you to&nbsp;connect sales&nbsp;reps&nbsp;with the best possible leads at the right time.</p> \n <h3>7. Re-Engagement Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: Inactive&nbsp;Contacts</h4> \n <p>Reawaken inactive contacts with a re-engagement workflow, enrolling contacts once they've met certain list criteria. For example, you could set conditions such as the length of time since their last form submission, website visit, or email click, triggering the email when it's been a while since a contact last engaged with you.</p> \n <p>In your workflow, try sending them an exclusive offer or coupon to get them excited about your company again. For more tips about launching an effective email re-engagement campaign, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32123/How-to-Use-Email-to-Re-Engage-Sleepy-Subscribers.aspx\">check out this post</a>.<strong><br></strong></p> \n <h3>8. Event Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: Registration or Attendance</h4> \n <p>Hosting a live, in-person <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/the-new-age-event-marketing\">event</a>? Or maybe an online event, like a webinar? Use email workflows to automate your communication to event registrants and attendees before, during, and after the event.</p> \n <p>For example, create a workflow that delivers important information&nbsp;registrants&nbsp;should know leading up to the event, such as hotel accommodations and agenda information for live events, or webinar log-in information for online events. When the event ends, set up&nbsp;a workflow that gives&nbsp;attendees online access to session slides&nbsp;and continues to&nbsp;nurture&nbsp;them with additional content or promotion for&nbsp;future events.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p> \n <h3>9. Abandoned Shopping Cart Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: Shopping Cart Abandonment</h4> \n <p>If you're an <a title=\"ecommerce business\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/ecommerce/\">ecommerce business</a>, you'll likely benefit from an abandoned shopping cart workflow. The concept here is simple: When someone&nbsp;adds an item to&nbsp;their online&nbsp;shopping cart but leaves your&nbsp;site without completing the purchase, you can trigger an email workflow that reminds them of their forgotten purchase and motivates&nbsp;them to complete the transaction by offering a special&nbsp;discount code or some other incentive to buy.</p> \n <h3>10. Upsell Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: Past Purchases</h4> \n <p>Communication with your customers shouldn't stop after they make a purchase. This is especially true if you sell a variety of different products and/or services. Use workflows as an opportunity to <a title=\"upsell your customers\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33214/How-to-Make-More-Money-From-Existing-Customers-With-Marketing-Automation.aspx\">upgrade or upsell your existing customers</a>, or sell them complementary products and services depending on what they've already purchased.</p> \n <p>Create dynamically updating lists of contacts who purchase a certain product<strong> -- </strong>or combination of products -- and create workflows aimed at recommending other products/services or encouraging upsells or add-ons.<strong><br></strong></p> \n <h3>11. Customer Happiness Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: High or Low NPS Scores</h4> \n <p>If you administer regular Net Promoter surveys of your customer base, you can use customers' <a title=\"Net Promoter Scores\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-definition-of-net-promoter-score-nps-in-under-100-words\">Net Promoter Scores</a> as a property to trigger workflows.</p> \n <p>Simply determine what your ideal customer happiness score is, and use that as the threshold for your dynamic list&nbsp;of happy customers. Then trigger a workflow for&nbsp;customers with \"happy\" scores and reward them&nbsp;with exclusive content, offers, or discounts.</p> \n <p>Trigger a different workflow for your \"unhappy\" customers that includes&nbsp;content/offers aimed at helping to&nbsp;improve their happiness. We'll give you a few bonus points if you segment those unhappy customers by the reasons they're unhappy, and send them even more targeted workflows aimed at addressing the issues that are making them so grumpy.<strong><br></strong></p> \n <h3>12. Customer Success/Engagement Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Triggers: Success Metrics or&nbsp;Product Usage</h4> \n <p>If you keep track of customer success metrics, you have a prime workflow opportunity on your hands. For example, if you're trying to build up your arsenal of <a title=\"customer case studies\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33282/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Creating-Compelling-Case-Studies.aspx\">customer case studies</a>, you could automatically trigger an email that asks customers if they'd be interesting in being featured as&nbsp;a success story once certain customer success metrics were met.</p> \n <p>Furthermore, if you keep track of customers' product adoption or feature usage, you could trigger a workflow for users who are exhibiting low product engagement,&nbsp;providing resources that educate and train them on how to use the product features they're not taking advantage of.<strong><br></strong></p> \n <h3>13. Upcoming Purchase Reminder Workflow</h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: Purchases Made on a Cycle</h4> \n <p>Does your contacts database include customers who typically purchase on a cycle? Enter those people into a workflow that gets triggered when they make a&nbsp;purchase.</p> \n <p>For instance, let's say you sell eye care products, and a customer purchases a six-month supply of prescription contacts. Enroll that customer into a workflow that sends them an automated email five months later as a&nbsp;reminder that their six-month supply is about to run out, and it might be time to order a new batch of contacts.<strong><br></strong></p> \n <h3>14. <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/workflows/contact-company-deal-ticket-or-quote-unexpectedly-enrolled-in-workflow\">Customer Service or Ticket Workflow</a></h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: A customer or prospect contacts customer service via email or an online form.</h4> \n <p>Sometimes, your customers or prospects might have trouble using your free or paid software. When this happens, fielding a bunch of customer service emails and messages can take tons of valuable time from your schedule.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>One way to avoid this it to create a workflow that categorizes that makes customer concerns into tickets that can be categorized, labeled and assigned to customer service reps on your team. These tickets can also help you keep tack of ongoing problems as well as when issues with a customer or prospect are resolved.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3>15. <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/workflows/contact-company-deal-ticket-or-quote-unexpectedly-enrolled-in-workflow\">Deal-Based Workflows</a></h3> \n <h4>Main Trigger: When someone e-signs a quote or contract.</h4> \n <p>Sealing the deal is obviously key to successful sales. Automating small aspects of this process, like emails someone might get after signing a contract or quote page with you, can allow you to spend more time nurturing the client over the phone, during demos, or through other messages.</p> \n <p>With a deal-based workflow, you can trigger confirmation emails when a prospect becomes a client or qualified lead by signing a quote or contract. With systems like HubSpot, you can also set the workflow to change the contact's status to show where they are in the sales lifecycle.</p> \n <p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in September 2012 and has been updated for freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n <p><em></em></p> \n <p><em></em></p> \n <p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in October 2016 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Femail-marketing-automation-examples&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:20:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6f2f88e7bba67e8f14bb69a0b4d346ea","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"pvaughan@hubspot.com (Pamela Vaughan)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/2832391/hubfs/Automation/Workflows/adding-workflow-enrollment-criteria.gif?width=600&name=adding-workflow-enrollment-criteria.gif":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-type-automated.jpg?width=600&name=email-type-automated.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-23-688_b0605e1249b500f1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-workflows-choose-an-action.jpg?width=426&name=hubspot-workflows-choose-an-action.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-28-975_ff4af860e21c45d4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-workflows-test.jpg?width=318&name=hubspot-workflows-test.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-25-258_aadbae3ae9781e54.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Femail-marketing-automation-examples&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn63@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-29-119_ec62bf6fc968ede0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336425},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"The 17 Best Resume Templates for Every Type of Professional","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-resume-templates","description":"<p>While an eye-catching resume alone probably won't land you your dream gig, it doesn't hurt to put a little extra effort into how you present yourself on paper.</p>  \n<p>The right resume design speaks to your individual skills and personality, and can propel your application to the top of the stack.

In particular, Google has been increasing the number of Featured Snippets that it displays for queries. This actually pushes organic results further down the page. So what does that mean for SEOs?</p>  \n<p>Well, that's what I set out to explore. Naturally, ranking in the Featured Snippet itself remedies the problem of positioning, but is this strategy something worth doing? What&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>a Featured Snippet, anyway?&nbsp;And more importantly, what do you have to do to appear there?</p> \n<p></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is a Featured Snippet?</h2> \n <p>Featured Snippets — also known as answer boxes — are selections of content displayed on the search engine results page (SERP) without the user having to visit the page where the content lives. Google puts these snippets above regular SERP results but below the ads in an effort of serving the user better.</p> \n</div> \n<p>For example, the Featured Snippet below displays the direct instructions pulled from the tasteofhome.com web page.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how_to_make_bread_featured_snippet.png?width=669&amp;name=how_to_make_bread_featured_snippet.png\" alt=\"List Featured Snippet on Google for how to make bread\" title=\"Featured Snippet: how to make bread\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>There are no ads for this query, so the Featured Snippet shown in the answer box is above position 1 of the SERPs for \"how to make bread.\" The directions are shown in four steps before the user has to click a single link.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Types of Featured Snippet</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Paragraph</li> \n  <li>List</li> \n  <li>Table</li> \n  <li>Video</li> \n  <li>Accordion</li> \n  <li>Rich Answer</li> \n  <li>Tool or Calculator</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>Paragraph</h3> \n<p>Paragraph-formatted answer to the searcher's query.

Examples of tools that Google shows are calculators, conversions, time zones, weather, game scores, and more.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/featured-snippet-tool.jpg?width=600&amp;name=featured-snippet-tool.jpg\" alt=\"featured snippet that shows an interactive mortgage calculator tool where the user can input their own values and receive a custom output directly on the serp\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h2>Why Should You Care About Featured Snippets?</h2> \n<p>One of the first conclusions that a lot of people involved with SEO jumped to was that Featured Snippets would have a hugely negative impact on the amount of people that actually click through to the pages within the results. This actually hasn't been the case. In fact, it's dramatically <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/seo-featured-snippets-leads-big-gains-236212\">increased the click-through rate</a>&nbsp;(CTR) of results ranking within it.</p> \n<p>From a sample of just under 5,000 queries, I found that the CTR to the HubSpot website for high volume keywords <strong>increased by over 114%</strong>,&nbsp;even when we ranked #1 (just below the Featured Snippet -- like in the example below).</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Inbound_Marketing_Featured_Snippet.png?width=671&amp;name=Inbound_Marketing_Featured_Snippet.png\" alt=\"Inbound Marketing Featured Snippet\" title=\"Inbound Marketing Featured Snippet\" width=\"671\" style=\"width: 671px;\"></p> \n<p>So to give you an example, let's say you&nbsp;rank #1 (the first post below the snippet) on page one of Google for a keyword that's searched for 10,000 times. From the data I've collected, you&nbsp;could expect roughly&nbsp;1,700 visits, compared to the 3,700 you might see if you landed the Featured Snippet spot -- and that's just one keyword.</p> \n<p>Here's another interesting piece of data that illustrates how valuable it can be to rank in the Featured Snippet within Google:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SERP_CTR_for_Featured_Snippet_vs_No_Featured_Snippet-1.png?width=669&amp;name=SERP_CTR_for_Featured_Snippet_vs_No_Featured_Snippet-1.png\" alt=\"Chart: SERP CTR for Featured Snippet vs No Featured Snippet\" title=\"Chart: SERP CTR for Featured Snippet vs No Featured Snippet\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>Again, to decipher this graph, here's a brief overview:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The x-axis relates to the <em>monthly search volume</em> for the search queries measured.</li> \n <li>The y-axis shows the click-through rate (CTR) of the ranking HubSpot URL from within Google (i.e. how many people clicked on our search result versus the rest of the results in the search results page for a query).</li> \n <li>The blue line plots the CTR from the SERPs for HubSpot URLs when we&nbsp;<strong>do not </strong>appear in the Featured Snippet, broken down by query search volume (x-axis).</li> \n <li>The orange line plots the CTR from the SERPs for HubSpot URLs when we&nbsp;<strong>do&nbsp;</strong>appear in the Featured Snippet, broken down by query search volume (x-axis).</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>By and large, we get much more clicks through to our content when we appear in the Featured Snippet, but this becomes increasingly important as the search volume for a query increases.</strong></p> \n<p>For high traffic keywords, ranking in the Featured Snippet saw an <strong>average increase in CTR of over 114%</strong>, and that's even if we're ranking #1 on page one.</p> \n<p>Now that you know that featured snippet acquisition is a worthwhile SEO strategy, there are a few things that you should keep in mind as you attempt to win your own placements.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Get a Featured Snippet</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Target question-based queries.</li> \n  <li>You don't necessarily need to use schema.</li> \n  <li>Organize the structure of your pages with headings and paragraph tags.</li> \n  <li>For non question-based keywords, take a definition-style approach.</li> \n  <li>When applicable, include steps for solving a problem or answering the question.</li> \n  <li>The content should be between 54-48 words long.</li> \n  <li>Don't rule out an international approach.</li> \n  <li>Don't worry about backlinks as much for Featured Snippets.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.07%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4rbrouufDP0\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>If you're looking to learn more about how to optimize your content for Featured Snippets, HubSpot Research has a full research report: <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/winning-googles-featured-snippet\">HubSpot's Guide to Winning Google's Featured Snippet</a>&nbsp;and HubSpot Academy has a <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/seo-training\">free SEO course.</a></p> \n<p>Featured Snippets have been a bit of a mystery for a lot of people involved with SEO, as it&nbsp;hasn't&nbsp;been that easy to determine what influences getting your content&nbsp;to appear within them. Here's what we know for sure:</p> \n<h3>1. Target question-based queries.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.stonetemple.com/rich-answers-in-search/\">Stone Temple found</a> that from 850,000 question-based queries, 19% of them had a Featured Snippet.</p> \n<h3>2. You don't necessarily need to use schema.</h3> \n<p>There's been a lot of conflicting advice out there about markup for snippets, including the idea that <a href=\"https://schema.org/\" class=\"external-link\">Schema.org</a> data was the reason behind Google displaying this data. However, considering that more than 80% of the websites I've looked at that rank within the Featured Snippet don't use any kind of Schema.org markup data, it's safe to say that this isn't the case.</p> \n<p>Not only that but Gary Illyes, a Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, has&nbsp;said outright that structured data <a href=\"https://www.seroundtable.com/google-structured-data-not-featured-snippets-21206.html\">has nothing to do</a> with ranking in the Featured Snippet.</p> \n<h3>3. Organize the structure of your pages with headings and paragraph tags.</h3> \n<p>Markup aside, a clear page structure seems to be important as well as the semantic relevance to the keyword in question.</p> \n<p>There should be an area on the page where the search query appears in a header (h2, h3, h4, etc.). The content you want to appear in the Featured Snippet should be placed in a &lt;p&gt; tag directly below the header.</p> \n<h3>4. For non question-based keywords, take a definition-style approach.</h3> \n<p>For shorter, less question-orientated keywords that display a Featured Snippet (e.g. \"Inbound Sales\"), it's much more likely that Google will pull through a paragraph of text. Google tends to prefer 'answers' that begin logically as an answer would.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Featued_snippet_example_1.png?width=669&amp;name=Featued_snippet_example_1.png\" alt=\"Featured Snippet Example\" title=\"Featured Snippet Example\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<h3>5. When applicable, include steps for solving a problem or answering the question.</h3> \n<p>Some answers require a more in-depth explanation, often involving a step-by-step process. Page structure is incredibly important here. Each step should be structured appropriately in a list format or represented on the page as heading (h3) tags.</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Featured_snippet_example_4.png?width=669&amp;name=Featured_snippet_example_4.png\" alt=\"Featured Snippet Example\" title=\"Featured Snippet Example\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> \n<h3>6. The content should be between 54-58 words long.</h3> \n<p>For the paragraph-style answers (not the steps), content that's between 54-58 words long tends to perform the best.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Chart_-_Frequency_of_Featured_Snippet_Word_Count.png?width=669&amp;name=Chart_-_Frequency_of_Featured_Snippet_Word_Count.png\" alt=\"Chart: Frequency of Featured Snippet Word Count\" title=\"Chart: Frequency of Featured Snippet Word Count\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>I extracted all of the content from within the Featured Snippets that I sampled. I did this to identify any trends in the content being displayed in order to better understand what Google is looking for.</p> \n<p><strong>As you can see, content between the length of 54-58 words in total seemed to appear by far the most frequently.</strong></p> \n<h3>7. Don't rule out an international approach.</h3> Featured Snippets for the same query often have different content within Google.com, Google.co.uk, Google.com.au, and Google.ie. Try \"how to search on Google\" as one of many examples.\n<br> \n<h3>8. Don't worry about backlinks as much for Featured Snippets.</h3> \n<p>During my analysis of 4,713 HubSpot queries for Featured Snippets, I uncovered something unusual, shown in the chart below.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Chart_-_Appearance_in_Featured_Snippet_vs_URL_Ranking.png?width=669&amp;name=Chart_-_Appearance_in_Featured_Snippet_vs_URL_Ranking.png\" alt=\"Chart: Appearance in Featured Snippet vs URL Ranking\" title=\"Chart: Appearance in Featured Snippet vs URL Ranking\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"></p> \n<p>Allow me to explain what this chart is demonstrating:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The numbers (1–5) in the y-axis relate to the position on page one that a HubSpot URL ranks for a given query.</li> \n <li>For each position HubSpot&nbsp;ranks for, there is a bar that shows how often we appear&nbsp;in the Featured Snippet (blue) and how often we don't (orange).</li> \n</ul> \n<p>So, for keywords that we rank #1 for on page one in Google SERPs, we only appear in the Featured Snippet 18% of the time. Contrastingly, we appear in the Featured Snippet 28% of the time when we rank #5. Strange, right?</p> \n<p><strong>Well, what this says to us is that once you're in the top 5 results on page one, <a href=\"http://www.matthewbarby.com/link-building-2014/\">building backlinks</a> and other authority signals matter much&nbsp;less for ranking in the Featured Snippet</strong>.</p> \n<p>In fact, I've seen lots of occasions where relatively unknown websites with much less SEO authority than HubSpot have ranked above us, possibly due to more intentional use of page structure and other best practices described above.</p> \n<p>My advice for anyone looking to increase their visibility within the Featured Snippet box is to first run a quick audit of the keywords that you're ranking for within your current SEO campaign&nbsp;and how many of them are question-based queries.&nbsp;Once you've got this list, you can drill down on where you're currently ranking, how well your content is structured, and then devise a plan to reoptimize your content based on the advice I've given above.</p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-featured-snippet-box&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important;

In advertising, your design catches your audience’s eye and points their attention to your copy. Then, it’s your copy’s job to hold your audience’s attention.</p>  \n<p>To help grab people’s attention in your advertisements, we’ve put together a list of seven ad tips, supported by examples, that’ll help give you ad design ideas to your brand cut through the noise.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Advertisement Design Tips</h2> \n<p>Read on to learn how to craft creatively refreshing ads that will convert your audience into customers.</p> \n<h3>1. Stand out from the crowd.</h3> \n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\">\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ad-tips-how-to-stand-out.jpg?width=600&amp;name=ad-tips-how-to-stand-out.jpg\" alt=\"Estee Lauder ad that is in black and white to stand out from the colorful magazine pages\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\">\n <a href=\"https://www.citizenwatch.com/us/en/eco-drive.html\">Image Source</a>\n</div> \n<p>In a world where countless brands fight for a limited amount of attention, the only way your advertisement can grab people’s attention is by being original.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, though, it can be tempting to leap onto the latest trend that all your competitors have already pounced on. If everyone else is implementing the latest tip or trick, it must work, right? To captivate an audience, though, you must resist this urge.</p> \n<p>Cliches repel attention. They sap your advertisement's creativity and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-neuroscience-of-your-brain-on-fiction.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">can’t activate the prefrontal cortex</a>, which is the part of the brain responsible for experiencing emotions. But how exactly do you create an original advertisement? Consider one of Estée Lauder’s print campaigns from the 1960s.</p> \n<p>Back then, Estée Lauder’s main competitors like L’Oréal, Revlon, and Helena Rubinstein all ran vibrant, colorful ads in magazines. Every makeup ad was beautiful and rich. But even though they seemed eye-popping at first glance, audiences became accustomed to these types of ads -- they all looked the same. They started blending in with each other.</p> \n<p>Realizing that no one could differentiate between the brands running full-color makeup ads flooding magazines during that time period anymore, Estée Lauder did something so controversial it was deemed “radical”, “stupid”, and even “ugly”: they ran their ads in sepia.</p> \n<p>Estée Lauder’s print advertising move received its fair share of criticism, but they’re ability to be original helped them immediately stand out from the crowd and rake in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Breakthrough-Copywriter-Eugene-Schwartz-Advertising/dp/1387028081\">25% more responses</a> than their previous color print campaigns.</p> \n<h3>2. Focus on benefits and not just features.</h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 623px; max-height: 350px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.18%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEqN0t_NI14?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com\" width=\"623\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>A feature is an attribute or aspect of your business that distinguishes it from others in the space. Features are important for consumers as they compare providers and make purchasing decisions. However, in advertising, you are often marketing to a wide audience, many of whom may not be familiar with your organization or know they have need for your goods or services.</p> \n<p>For this reason, advertising features can be ineffective and overly salesy. The benefits of a product, on the other hand, can be far more persuasive and impressionable to a wide audience.</p> \n<p>Tide exhibits this idea well with their Superbowl commercial.</p> \n<p>They could have demonstrated the features of their product by showing a dirty shirt becoming clean again.</p> \n<p>Instead, they focus on the advantage: clean and crisp shirts.</p> \n<p>They even use a bit of humor while calling out this approach as #NotaTideAd.</p> \n<h3>3. Use humor.</h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 623px; max-height: 350px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.18%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-pVnnGK6BP4?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com\" width=\"623\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Speaking of humor, it is an effective tool in advertising because it evokes positive emotion.</p> \n<p>The best thing advertising can do is make your solutions memorable. The second best thing it can do is associate that memory with positive emotions.</p> \n<p>Zola uses this in their wedding website ad. Weddings are already associated with love and happy times, but Zola differentiates their approach by flipping the script on audience expectation with a silly situation.</p> \n<p>Instead of imagining somber heartfelt \"I dos,\" the couple talks through logistics, which Zola can help with.</p> \n<h3>4. Convey one message — and one message only.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/design-tips-simple-copy.jpg?width=600&amp;name=design-tips-simple-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Eco-Drive ad that reads &quot;A watch that never needs a battery&quot; alongside an image of a watch\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://www.citizenwatch.com/us/en/eco-drive.html\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Sometimes, marketers think the more benefits and features they include in their ads, the higher their conversion rate will be. But trying to read a jumbled ad requires a lot of thought and energy, so cramming an ad with a bricks of copy doesn’t actually grab people’s attention. It repels it.</p> \n<p>To immediately hook people and persuade them to read the rest of your ad, consider conveying one message per ad. Spotlighting your product or service’s main benefit or feature will make it easy for your audience to understand its value and increase the likelihood of doing business with you because they’ll leave your ad remembering only one message: your product’s or service’s main feature will benefit their lives somehow, someway.</p> \n<p>For example, in Citizen’s ad for their Eco-Drive watch, they only use a single line of copy and a simple image to convey their product’s value to their audience -- a watch that never needs a battery.</p> \n<h3>5. Make it visual.</h3> \n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\">\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/visual-best-practices-for-ads.jpg?width=600&amp;name=visual-best-practices-for-ads.jpg\" alt=\"a lego ad that displays a t-rex in the shadow of a blocky lego shape\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\">\n <a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/creative-ads-lego-the-shadow/\">Image Source</a>\n</div> \n<p>When we were babies, we relied on vision to associate objects with behaviors, like a ball meaning play time. Vision was the only way to learn about the world.</p> \n<p>That’s why you can understand visual information in <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/learn/visual-marketing/\">250 milliseconds and why your visual system activates over 50% of your brain</a>. Visual storytelling is the best way for people to grasp concepts and data easily.</p> \n<p>For instance, in LEGO’s ad, they only use two images, a simple lego creation and a shadow of a dinosaur, but you can instantly form a concrete understanding of its core idea -- with Legos, you can create anything.</p> \n<h3>6. Know your market.</h3> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpopfitclothing%2Fvideos%2F424148705066611%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=476\" width=\"476\" height=\"476\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>You can't hope to capture your audience's attention if you don't know who they are.</p> \n<p>Pop Fit is a leggings company that makes apparel for all sizes and body shapes. A good portion of their target audience is women who are rarely represented by models, particularly in the health and wellness space, and have difficulty finding athletic wear. For these women, an ad that shows people who look like them is a show stopper.</p> \n<h3>7. Leverage hyperbole.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200-25.png?width=450&amp;name=pasted%20image%200-25.png\" alt=\"Nikol Paper Towels Ad that shows dried grapes, implying it sucked the moisture out of them to turn them into raisins\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6489808059668537344\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Exaggerating your product’s benefits, in a clever and obvious way, is one of the best methods for slipping some humor into your advertisement, which can capture your audience’s attention and trigger an emotional response from them.</p> \n<p>For instance, Nikol’s paper towels obviously can’t turn grapes into raisins, but this ad highlights the product's absorbent powers in such a clear and artful way, they didn’t need to write a single line of copy.</p> \n<h3>8. Show, don't tell.</h3> \n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\">\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ad-tips-show-don't-tell.jpg?width=600&amp;name=ad-tips-show-don't-tell.jpg\" alt=\"siemens ad that shows washing machines in a library\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\">\n <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6490261063861440512/\">Image Source</a>\n</div> \n<p>Showing your audience something is much more engaging and interesting than telling them it. Relying on implication to convey a message is mysterious, making it more fun for your audience to figure out.</p> \n<p>For example, in Siemens’ creative ad, they show the benefits of their product by unexpectedly placing their washers and dryers in a library to show you that they’re so quiet, even a librarian wouldn’t need to shush them.</p> \n<h3>9. Swap connotations.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1em;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(1)-9.png?width=328&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(1)-9.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 328px;\" alt=\"heinz ad that shows someone holding the ketchup bottle with an oven mitt\" width=\"328\"></em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6489147159219441664/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>In relation to food, the word “hot” has multiple meanings: having a high temperature and being spicy. Heinz brilliantly used the connotation of high temperature to highlight the spiciness of their ketchup, and their creative method of communicating the value of their product helped them instantly attract people’s attention.</p> \n<h3>10. Be authentic.</h3> \n<p>Planet Fitness is a brand that has long worked to make fitness less scary and more accessible to people, as evidenced by their \"judgment-free zone\" policies.</p> \n<p>Part of that mission means encouraging people to be themselves. True to form, as many of their facilities open with new sanitizing procedures, they released this video ad announcing their policies. In it, Planet Fitness employees dance with inhibition. This fun and authentic ad supports who Planet Fitness is as a company.</p> \n<h3>11. Turn your ad into a game.</h3> \n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\">\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gamification-of-ads.png?width=444&amp;name=gamification-of-ads.png\" alt=\"Mazda ad that shows a car in a video game environment\" width=\"444\" style=\"width: 444px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <a href=\"https://www.digitaland.tv/blog/7-gamified-banner-ads-taking-display-advertising-to-a-whole-new-level/\">Image Source</a>\n</div> \n<p>The brain is wired to predict things. It’s an evolutionary trait that allows us to anticipate what’s going to happen next and quickly react to it. That said, advertisements that are predictable only require a shred of thought to understand, so they’re too easy to grasp and, in turn, too boring to engage anyone.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, if you can scrap predictability from your advertisements, you force your audience into a deeper level of thinking to digest your message, compelling them to pay more attention to it.</p> \n<p>One of the best ways to ensnare your audience attention and get them to interact with your advertisement is by turning it into a game. By framing your advertisement like a game that can be beat, just like Mazda’s ad, above, your audience has the opportunity to earn an intellectual reward if they spend just the right amount of mental energy playing your brand’s game and grasping your advertisement's message, which is something most people won’t ever pass up.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a></h3> \n<p>Canva is one of the premier free design platforms, available on both desktop and via a robust mobile app.</p> \n<p>As an online ad maker, Canva provides a large library of pre-designed templates, 1 million stock images, and drag-and-drop design building.

All that work that goes into a post for less-than-stellar engagement is, no doubt, one of the most frustrating experiences.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there's a way to combat low traffic and bring eyes to your writing: search engine optimization. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\"><span>SEO</span></a> is a language that speaks specifically to search engines like Google to tell it your post deserves to be at the top of search engine results pages (SERPs).</p> \n<p>As marketers, we're always aiming to write content that'll rank highly on Google, and SEO is the bridge that'll help you get there.</p> \n<p>Of course, that begs the question: How do you write in SEO's language?</p> \n<p>For that, don't worry — we've got you covered. In this post, we're going to dive into 13 ways you can master writing for that high ranking your content deserves.</p> \n<p>Ready to get started?</p> \n<h3>1. Use headings to your benefit.</h3> \n<p>Headers tell Google what different sections of your blog article will be about. In this post, for example, the header, \"How To Write Blog Posts for SEO,\" tells the search engine what this section is about.</p> \n<p>Users who type search queries like, \"writing for SEO\" into Google will likely come across this post because of what the header tells Google. Ultimately, search engines are going to look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>headers and snippets before they look at body text</span></a>.</p> \n<p>Think of Google as a reader who is skimming your blog. They're going to focus on the main ideas — and that's what headers, like H2s and H3s, display. Use headers to accurately convey the main idea of your section, but make sure each header uses accurate, high-intent keywords. When you use the right keywords (using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/22842/4-helpful-tools-for-identifying-the-right-keywords.aspx?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>keyword research tools</span></a>) you have a much higher chance of helping your post rank on the first page.</p> \n<h3>2. Take advantage of featured snippets.</h3> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9351707?p=featured_snippets&amp;hl=en&amp;visit_id=637322668994927457-279137339&amp;rd=1\"><span>Google</span></a>, \"Featured snippets come from web search listings. Google's automated systems determine whether a page would make a good featured snippet to highlight for a specific search request.\"</p> \n<p>Featured snippets on Google are the most direct answers to search queries. For instance, if I were to search, \"How do you write a blog post?\", Google might use a featured snippet to show the most sufficient answer:</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jkrLX_FCneOwRvR527KfiHOfFW4ZYp15QeyUkS8X363Wr52Q5NKHlUw2JCvyFVAGwgi7k5CTIka7eKnNWO7XNaIHBbzMknV1lBsQCiE5ogQZdW0Yw0y1EGJbrB58OcHM8C1tY8IE\" width=\"624\" height=\"436\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of a featured snippet on Google.\" /></span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-featured-snippet-box?_ga=2.256326411.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>To earn a featured snippet</span></a> on Google, you'll want to answer the questions readers might have when they come to your blog post. For instance, if the search term is \"how should I write a blog post?\", answer that question with a list, starting with \"How to Write A Blog Post\" as the header, accompanied by a list of items that are relevant and actionable.</p> \n<p>If you're wondering how to make list items actionable, a good rule of thumb is to write complete sentences and start each sentence with a verb, like \"Write\", \"Research\", \"Create\". Additionally, make sure each sentence answers the question or challenge. For definitions, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/winning-googles-featured-snippet?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>paragraph snippets</span></a>, make sure they're succinct, but give enough background to explain the word or phrase.</p> \n<h3>3. Write to answer questions for customers.</h3> \n<p>One of the reasons we write blog posts is to diversify the content on our website. Another reason is to boost the credibility of our business. But if \"to solve for your audience\" isn't in your list of reasons, you may be losing out on key SEO opportunities.</p> \n<p>Google answers countless questions a day. For instance, I must've Googled about five questions in the last hour alone. When you frame posts to answer the queries of your audience, Google will see that and push your post to a higher page.</p> \n<p>Earlier, we talked about the bells and whistles you can add to posts to boost rankings. But, additionally, you'll want to ensure the content you're beefing up is also working towards that goal.</p> \n<p>If you're stuck on trying to figure out what your audience is asking, you'll want to perform keyword research. Sites like <a href=\"http://ahrefs.com/\"><span>Ahrefs</span></a> and <a href=\"http://woorank.com/\"><span>Woorank</span></a> crawl search engines for popular search queries. To organize the process, create different topic clusters to write about, such as \"Instagram Marketing,\" \"LinkedIn Advertising\" — subjects you can dive into that provide value to your audience.</p> \n<p>Still stuck on keywords? Don't worry — this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>keyword research guide is perfect for beginners.</span></a></p> \n<h3>4. Use meta descriptions to your advantage.</h3> \n<p>Are you adding meta descriptions to your post? If your answer is \"No,\" then you're probably not giving your post the most exposure possible. Let's get into why they're important.</p> \n<p>By now, we've talked about a couple of the ways a blog post can communicate with Google: with headers, keywords, and snippets. However, that's not an exhaustive list.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/meta-descriptions?_ga=2.210163477.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>Meta descriptions</span></a> is another method Google leverages when ranking search results. Meta descriptions are the 1-3 sentence descriptions you'll find underneath the title of a result.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SthW36UwXSSgw6xA9MsSlcduXxbbMVKP3QpXTdUdc1KGMa4pqGAvSipqTkuL-TZICne4Dr-WXlVVEDagqYlDYavLLIPJEzesocOU6Gy9_qEHPbWEGmvwB6vIZJmd5zRmxy0YbxCg\" width=\"624\" height=\"227\" alt=\"Example of a meta description on Google.\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></span></p> \n<p>Use meta descriptions to sum up what your post is about. Remember to keep it short, use keywords, and make sure it's engaging. After all, there are going to be loads of posts similar to yours, aiming to rank at #1. You're going to want yours to stand out above the rest.</p> \n<p>Most blogging software have meta description boxes built into the toolbar or post formatting options, so you won't have to look far to use the function. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/?_ga=2.216912790.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>HubSpot</span></a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\"><span>WordPress</span></a>, for example, point out where to add meta descriptions in the post editor.</p> \n<h3>5. Add alt text to images.</h3> \n<p>With any image you add to your post — whether it be the featured image or a body text one — you'll want to add alt text. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32567/a-marketer-s-guide-to-optimizing-images-for-google-search.aspx?_ga=2.216912790.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\"><span>Alt text describes what's happening</span></a> in the photo. Think of it as a closed caption for images.</p> \n<p>Alt text helps Google, as well as those who are visually impaired, understand why the photo is in your post. This improves your article's rank and accessibility, making it more shareable.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you include an infographic about audience segmentation, the alt text should read something like, \"A helpful infographic that explains audience segmentation.\" Notice how this sentence uses keywords to appeal to Google even further.</p> \n<p>Now let's say you're using a stock image as a featured photo, but it doesn't necessarily depict anything that relates to your post's content. For instance, let's say your topic is click-through rate, and this is your featured image:</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2jNZPSwpDQmCpp93qSsfmJzrztmQR8rQSjoBxLZDUz6vQLjPKBNCkbd2_njQNqt5lVzCZPFEV70MJmreYxiRHjUSU8yFvmJI6ZIhHHe1Kt5gKjwFk6ZbBvVM1-rC_pfTdREJUSih\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"A marketing team discusses audience segmentation strategy.\" /></span></p> \n<p>This doesn't really have anything to do with audience segments, right? But what you can do to remedy the situation is to make a scenario. For instance, \"A marketing team discusses audience segmentation strategy.\"</p> \n<p>This alt text uses keywords to describe a situation that fits into the theme of the post. That way, your image doesn't bring down the ranking of your post, but works towards improving where it ranks. If Google sees alt text, it's another box checked for a high position on SERPs.</p> \n<h3>6. Don't limit keywords to the body of your post.</h3> \n<p>Ultimately, keywords should be used in nearly every part of your blog. We've talked a little about where keywords can be included in your post: snippets, photos, and headers, for example.</p> \n<p>Keywords are so powerful because they're the jumping off point for SERPs. Google will always take what browsers type into the search bar and search for web pages with those exact words. So it's important to make sure every element, from the post title, to the calls-to-action, relate to your keywords.</p> \n<p>That said, it's also important not to keyword stuff your post. The goal is to make your page fully optimized, not overbearing. Find natural fits for keyword additions, but don't force them so your content is illegible.</p> \n<p>For example, if your keywords are \"account based marketing,\" \"startups,\" and \"sales,\" your meta description <em>shouldn't</em> be something like:</p> \n<p>\"Sales for account based marketing startups.\"</p> \n<p>Instead, try focusing on one or two phrases to make the description more natural:</p> \n<p>\"Are you looking for killer strategies to boost your account-based marketing game? Find out our surefire secrets in this post.\"</p> \n<p>That way, you're still using keywords, but you're not oversaturating the post to the point where it's illegible. Remember, even though Google is a search engine, it still has to comprehend your post in order to recommend it to website browsers. Additionally, a reader's experience will determine how well your posts rank. If readers bounce from your webpage because it's confusing to them, that will signal to Google that your post isn't good enough to rank.</p> \n<h3>7. Identify highly-effective keywords when looking for post ideas.</h3> \n<p>Google handles <a href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/\">over 40,000 search queries</a> a second. Staggering, right? If you want to cut through search result clutter and outrank your competitors, you need to target the specific keywords and phrases your potential customers are searching. How else will they find your content and website?</p> \n<p>To identify those hot keywords, head on over to the social platforms your target audience frequents and see what’s trending. Pay close attention to the exact phrases they use and monitor popular industry terms and topics.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a> can also give you a feel for what keywords are popular at any given time. If you see searches are steadily declining over time for a specific keyword, you know that’s probably not the right keyword to target for your marketing and vice versa for increasing trends.</p> \n<p>If you’re ever running low on keyword ideas, get inspiration from your competition. Use tools to see what keywords they’re currently ranking for — if these keywords are relevant to your business, consider using them too! <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMRush</a> lets you enter a competitor and see the keywords they’re ranking for, their position in search results, traffic received for that keyword and other key metrics.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that the most obvious keywords aren’t always the best keywords. Searchers tend to use very specific “long-tail” keywords, keyword phrases and questions when they’re looking for something.</p> \n<p>Long-tail keywords comprise up to <a href=\"https://www.hittail.com/blog/the-hidden-value-of-long-tail-seo\">70% of all search traffic</a> and can unlock the door to successful SEO. When <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/\">WPBeginner</a>, the largest WordPress resource site for WordPress beginners, adopted a long-tail SEO strategy, they increased their organic search traffic by <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-we-increased-our-organic-search-traffic-by-using-hittail/\">20% in just two months</a>!</p> \n<p>Because you face fierce competition for shorter, more general keywords, you often have a better chance of ranking in the top results for long-tail keywords. And, long-tail keywords allow you to zero in on higher quality website traffic that often knows what they’re looking for and may be farther along in the buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve done your research and built a list of what you think are the most valuable, relevant keywords, plug them into a keyword research tool like Google’s <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\">Keyword Planner</a>, <a href=\"https://moz.com/products/pro/keyword-explorer\">Moz’s Keyword Explorer</a>, <a href=\"https://keywordseverywhere.com/ubersuggest.html\">Ubersuggest</a>, <a href=\"http://keywordtool.io/\">Keyword Tool</a> and so on. Many keyword research tools give you the monthly volume for any given keyword. Test out different keyword tools — marketers are drawn to different ones for different reasons.</p> \n<p>Depending on your business or industry (or budget or bandwidth for SEO efforts), it may be important to rank for high competition, short tail keywords. Still, try to also optimize for a healthy dose of long-tail keywords that are high in search volume but low in competition. You may find it’s much easier to rank for these words.</p> \n<p>Remember that your focus keywords will evolve over time as trends shift, terminology changes or your product/service line changes. Be sure to conduct keyword research periodically to ensure you’re still focusing on the right keywords for your target audience and not missing out on vital ranking opportunities.</p> \n<h3>8. Naturally integrate those keywords throughout your posts.</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve decided on a list of target keywords, it’s time to write a blog post focused on one of these keywords. Brainstorm blog topics with your team and decide on a topic that will entice and engage your target audience.</p> \n<p>Keep your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">buyer personas</a>, their motivations, challenges, interests, etc. in mind throughout the brainstorming process. Choose a topic that will <a href=\"http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/how-to-create-an-emotional-connection-with-prospects-to-turn-them-into-customers\">emotionally resonate</a> with your potential customers and their needs, desires or pains.</p> \n<p>As you write your blog, your keyword and natural variations should be regularly interspersed throughout the post. Your primary keyword should appear in these key places:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-for-seo#BlogPostTitle\">Title</a></li> \n <li>Headings and subheadings</li> \n <li>URL if possible</li> \n <li>Image alt text (search engines can’t read images)</li> \n <li>Meta description</li> \n <li>Throughout the content</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Remember that you’re writing for humans, not search engines. Focus on engaging readers with a natural writing style that takes their needs and interests into account.</p> \n<h3>9. Link to influential websites.</h3> \n<p>As you build out your blog post, don’t be afraid to link to other articles or blogs.</p> \n<p>Linking to applicable and reputable websites not only offers blog readers additional reading material to expand their knowledge, but it also shows Google and other search engines that you’ve done your research. And the blogger or writer may even return the favor and link to your site.</p> \n<p>Nothing strengthens a blog post like hard-to-argue-with, research-backed statistics from influential websites. Compelling stats help you build a more convincing and concrete argument that will get your readers thinking (especially when they’re from trustworthy sites they know and love).</p> \n<h3>10. Aim for scannable, longer posts.</h3> \n<p>In an age of short attention spans (<a href=\"http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/\">average of 8 seconds for humans</a>), you would think shorter blog posts are the way to go. But search engines actually prefer longer, in-depth blog posts.</p> \n<p>The longer your blog post, the greater its chance of appearing in the top search engine results. <a href=\"http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/\">SerpIQ found</a> that the 10th position pages have 400 fewer words than 1st position pages. Longer posts will rank more easily for your target keyword.</p> \n<p>Think about it: the more content on the page, the more clues search engines have to figure out what your blog is about. We recommend writing a minimum of <a href=\"https://yoast.com/blog-post-length/\">300 words per blog post</a>. This length gives search engines plenty of keywords and text to crawl and helps them understand what your blog is about.</p> \n<p>The downside to longer blogs is that they may scare off your readers. We live in a world of skimmers and scanners. In a heat map analysis, CoSchedule learned that <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/read-your-content/\">only 10-20% of their readers</a> were making it to the bottom of their posts. So, the million dollar question is, how can longer blog posts appeal to today’s online readers?</p> \n<p>You can write <a href=\"http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/scannable-content-your-key-to-writing-successful-blogs\">scannable</a>, readable blog posts that hook online readers by tightening up your sentences and paragraphs. Turn a long-winded sentence into two. Keep your paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max.</p> \n<p>Also, take full advantage of bulleted lists and subheadings that grab reader’s attention. By following these tactics, you’ll create blogs that are easier to read (especially on a mobile device!) and less intimidating to the scanner’s eye.</p> \n<h3>11. Internally link words or phrases to other posts on your site.</h3> \n<p>Linking to other pages or blog posts on your website helps search engines crawl your website and create a more accurate sitemap. It also helps your audience discover more of your content and get to know you as a trustworthy, credible source of information.</p> \n<p>Internal links to other valuable content keep users on your site longer, reducing bounce rate and increasing your potential for a conversion (and isn’t that what it’s all about?).</p> \n<p>When linking to any pages on your website, or even outside sources, use natural language for your anchor text. Avoid using spammy or generic text such as “top-rated cheap laptops” or “click here.”</p> \n<p>Instead, use descriptive keywords that give readers a sense of what they will find when they click on the hyperlink, such as a <a href=\"http://hubs.ly/H05xGXn0\">search engine optimization guide</a>.</p> \n<p>Never force feed links to your top webpages, featured products or discounted items. These types of links will only turn off readers and could lead to search engines penalizing your website.</p> \n<p>A word of caution: don’t overdo your internal linking or any linking. We know it’s tempting to link to all of your blogs and webpages, but only choose the ones that best enhance the point or insight you’re writing about in any particular blog. Always think about whether or not these links naturally tie in with the subject matter and if they will offer significant value to your readers.</p> \n<h3>12. Optimize pictures for the fastest possible page speed.</h3> \n<p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">rewards pages with faster page speed </a>and places those that lag lower on its rankings. So, it's important to make sure your page-load times are as quick as possible.</p> \n<p>One of the leading culprits of page lag is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">large photos</a>. If the photo you uploaded is too big, it will make the page take a longer time to load -- even if the image <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">doesn't seem huge on screen</a>. Luckily, you can keep your posts visually interesting without sacrificing crucial speed.</p> \n<p>Once you pick a photo, use a free compression software, like Squoosh.app to make it as small as it can go before it loses any quality. Any removal of excess photo data will speed up loading times so readers won't have to wait.</p> \n<p>If you suspect that your SEO issues are related to low page speeds, Google offers a free tool that can score your page and give you suggestions for speed improvement. Here's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-page-speed\">a guide on how to use it and boost your score</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Preform link building strategies.</h3> \n<p>Traffic from places other than Google is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software\">crucial to your search rankings</a>. Why? Think of search results like a competition where the winners get the most votes. Each webpage that links back to you is considered a \"vote\" for your website, which makes your content more trustworthy in the eyes of Google. In turn, this will make you rise farther up on search results.</p> \n<p>So, it's good to write posts that other websites or publications will want to hyperlink within their own posts. You can also write posts on other business' websites that link back to your website in some way.</p> \n<p>To make your website's blogpost more linkable, include valuable assets or information, such as your own data, original thoughts, infographics, definitions, or other facts that people might not find anywhere else.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of how this mindset could help you. If you write a post titled \"How to Make a Video Tutorial,\" or \"13 Stats about Video Tutorials,\" bigger sites that are writing about something similar might hyperlink words like \"video tutorials\" or \"research from [Your Company Name]\" to your post so they can give their reader more context without repeating your work.</p> \n<p>Once you've written the post, you might want to start sending it to other publications or websites that might want to discuss it or link it to their other posts. This outreach lets other publications know of the post and might also help you grow link building alliances with them in the future.</p> \n<p>You can also consider doing promotion, such as interviews or guest posts that link to your website's blog post to further encourage link building.</p> \n<p>These strategies can be key to your SEO success, but they can be time consuming. To help you, consider trying out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">one of these softwares</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Title Blog Posts for SEO</h2> \n<p>Even with a great, SEO-friendly post body, a bad title could hurt you in search engines. To title your post with SEO in mind, draft a clear understandable title that both shows the reader what they're about to read and integrates the keywords you identified in the first step. As mentioned above, write something that pleases Google's ranking algorithms, but is also understandable and enticing to humans.</p> \n<p>Here are a few examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If you're a beauty blogger and you see that people are searching \"how to wear matte lipstick,\" your post could be titled, \"How to Wear Matte Lipstick: A 5-Step Guide.\"</li> \n <li>On the other hand, if your blog covers artificial intelligence and you see that people are searching a new AI app, you could write a blog post called \"How to Use [Insert AI App Name],\" or \"We Tried the New [Insert App Name] App: Here's What Happened\"</li> \n <li>If you blog about farming or sustainability and find out that \"what to buy at farm stands\" is a regular search, you might write a listicle titled \"What to Buy at Farm Stands This Summer.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You know how to write content audiences will love. Now, it's time to write for what Google loves. SEO only heightens the chance of your post getting seen by the right audiences, expanding your reach.</p> \n<p>It can sound tricky at first, writing for two audiences, but just remember these takeaways: keywords, snippets, and descriptions. Learning a new language takes time, but luckily, your blogging software can likely remind you of these SEO tips. I can't wait to see your next blog post at the top of my search results.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fblogging-for-seo&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:34:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jkrLX_FCneOwRvR527KfiHOfFW4ZYp15QeyUkS8X363Wr52Q5NKHlUw2JCvyFVAGwgi7k5CTIka7eKnNWO7XNaIHBbzMknV1lBsQCiE5ogQZdW0Yw0y1EGJbrB58OcHM8C1tY8IE","linkMd5":"09d376dc66fa9d912ba8e5b0b85f7658","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"Courtney Feairheller","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jkrLX_FCneOwRvR527KfiHOfFW4ZYp15QeyUkS8X363Wr52Q5NKHlUw2JCvyFVAGwgi7k5CTIka7eKnNWO7XNaIHBbzMknV1lBsQCiE5ogQZdW0Yw0y1EGJbrB58OcHM8C1tY8IE":null,"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SthW36UwXSSgw6xA9MsSlcduXxbbMVKP3QpXTdUdc1KGMa4pqGAvSipqTkuL-TZICne4Dr-WXlVVEDagqYlDYavLLIPJEzesocOU6Gy9_qEHPbWEGmvwB6vIZJmd5zRmxy0YbxCg":null,"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2jNZPSwpDQmCpp93qSsfmJzrztmQR8rQSjoBxLZDUz6vQLjPKBNCkbd2_njQNqt5lVzCZPFEV70MJmreYxiRHjUSU8yFvmJI6ZIhHHe1Kt5gKjwFk6ZbBvVM1-rC_pfTdREJUSih":null,"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fblogging-for-seo&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn74@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-23-046_8f71651f20b60f93.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336432},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"The Social Media Content Calendar Template Every Marketer Needs [Free Template]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx","description":"<p>\"We have a 9 a.m. meeting? Hold on -- let me just click around the internet like a maniac to find something for the morning tweet.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sound familiar? Scrambling for social content is nothing new. We have meetings. We run late. Things come up. And it's really hard to get any meaningful amount of work done when you have the next social media update looming over your head every 30, 60, or 90 minutes.&nbsp;It all&nbsp;moves so fast that you might periodically feel a case of the vapors coming on, which is why pre-scheduled social media content should be your new best friend.<strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p>To make social media content easier for companies to plan and schedule across the accounts they manage, we created a <strong><a title=\"templated schedule\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\">social&nbsp;media&nbsp;content calendar template</a></strong><a title=\"templated schedule\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\"></a>. And recently,&nbsp;we updated&nbsp;to be better, faster, stronger, and just generally prettier.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But first...</p> \n<h2>What is a content calendar?</h2> \n<p>A content calendar organizes your publishing schedule by date so that you can keep track of deadlines, better manage your content creation team, and create transparency with all parties.</p> \n<h3>What's in this content calendar template?</h3> \n<p>Every content calendar is different and should be adjusted for your unique process. However, in this one, you'll find a general schedule tab, your monthly planning calendar, a repository for website content, and updates for each of the top social media platforms:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#twitter\">Twitter</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#facebook\">Facebook</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#linkedin\">LinkedIn</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#instagram\">Instagram</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#pinterest\">Pinterest</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>This blog post will walk you through exactly how to use the template to stay on top of your social media content planning for each one.</p> \n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> HubSpot customers can also schedule content through <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/social-inbox\">Social Inbox</a>, or use this spreadsheet to organize their content and subsequently upload it to Social Inbox. Detailed instructions for doing this exist in <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\">the cover sheet of the template</a>.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<h2>How to Use the Social Media&nbsp;Calendar Template to Plan Your&nbsp;Content Schedule</h2> \n<p>When&nbsp;you <a title=\"open up the social media publishing template\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\">open up the social media content calendar&nbsp;template</a>, you'll notice the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet has several different tabs, most of which are dedicated to a specific social network.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-calendar-excel-tabs.jpg?width=1362&amp;name=content-calendar-excel-tabs.jpg\" alt=\"content calendar excel tabs: schedule, monthly planning calendar, content repository, twitter updates, facebook updates, linkedin updates, instagram updates, pinterest updates\" width=\"1362\" style=\"width: 1362px;\" /></p> \n<p>The reason you'll want a different worksheet for every social network is simply that every social network is a little bit different.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-perfect-social-media-posts-slideshare\">You can't just craft one, single social media update</a> and use it across LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest.</p> \n<p>You can certainly promote the same piece of content across those networks, but that doesn't mean you'll craft your update in the same way for every single one of them. (In fact, you may even want to add additional tabs if you're active on other networks, like Quora or YouTube.)</p> \n<p>This following sub-sections will walk you through how to fill out each of the tabs you see in this template -- the updates for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Pinterest. But before we get to that, let's just walk through the \"Monthly Planning Calendar\" so you know what that's for.</p> \n<h3>Monthly Social Media&nbsp;Schedule&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>The tab \"Monthly Planning Calendar\" provides an overall snapshot of your monthly social media campaigns. It'll help you coordinate better with other stakeholders, not to mention keep all the moving parts straight in your own mind. Here's what it looks like:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-month-view.png?width=669&amp;height=388&amp;name=social-media-calendar-month-view.png\" title=\"social-media-calendar-month-view.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"388\" alt=\"social media content calendar month view with colored cells for each content type\" /></p> \n<p>There are three sections to take note of when you edit this template for your own purposes. First, the color-coding key: These are the types of content or campaigns around which you might coordinate, like ebooks, webinars, blog posts, product launches, and so on. Though only some of these might be relevant to you, they're there to indicate what you may want to put in there -- so be sure to edit these categories to align with your own campaigns.</p> \n<p>The other two sections you'll need to edit are the Month and Year at the top of the calendar (duh), as well as the cells below each day of the week. In those cells, you should&nbsp;enter&nbsp;the type of content you'll be promoting that day and color-code it to align with the campaign it's supporting.</p> \n<p>Instead of deleting all the content in this spreadsheet each month, I recommend copying this worksheet twelve times over, and creating a separate sheet for each month. (If that gets to be too overwhelming, you can always save those tabs as a separate file.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Twitter Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Alright, now let's get to the social media content. This section will be the lengthiest, because all subsequent sections will draw on the instructions we go through here. So if you read one section in this whole post, make it&nbsp;this one.</p> \n<p>Let's say you want to add some tweets&nbsp;to your scheduling template.&nbsp;Skip over to the \"Twitter Updates\" tab, where you'll see this:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=296&amp;name=social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Twitter content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"296\" /></p> \n<p>The first four columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" \"Time,\" and \"Date &amp; Time\" are there for your convenience, and if you choose to use a third-party app for pre-scheduling your tweets (like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/social-inbox\">HubSpot's Social Inbox</a>), then these columns will be useful.&nbsp;For now, just fill in the date on which you'd like your updates to publish to Twitter, and the time at which you'd like them to go out. The \"Date &amp; Time\" column will automatically change based on what you input in the previous two columns.</p> \n<p>Now, let's move over to the \"Message\" column. Here,&nbsp;input the copy you'd like to appear in your tweet, bearing in mind you should<strong>&nbsp;cap it at 116 characters to allow enough room for a link, and at 115 characters to allow room for an image.</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-limit-social-media-blog-posts\">Read this blog post for a full character count guide</a>.) This spreadsheet will auto-calculate the number of characters you've entered to keep you on-point, turning yellow when you've reached 95 characters, and red when you've reached 116 characters.</p> \n<p>After you've composed your tweet, paste the URL you'd like to include in your tweet in the \"Link\" column. Be sure to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">include UTM parameters</a>&nbsp;so&nbsp;you'll know whether all of these tweets are actually driving traffic, leads, and customers. This is an important step to remember if you'd like to be able to demonstrate ROI from social. You can also use the \"Campaign\" column to add an associated campaign, which helps which more robust tracking and reporting.</p> \n<p>Finally, in the \"Image\" column, attach the tweet's image (if you have one). For Twitter, we recommend images that are 1024&nbsp;x 512 pixels. (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.) If you're having trouble attaching your image to the spreadsheet, follow these steps:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right-click the cell in which you'd like your image.</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click \"Hyperlink,\" then click the \"Document\" button, and finally, click \"Select\" to choose your image.</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the \"Choose a File\" window, select the image from your computer and click \"Open.\"</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 4:</strong> You'll now see the image attached to the \"Insert Hyperlink\" screen. Feel free to edit the \"Display\" text to change the file name, then click \"OK.\"</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This process is simply for organizational purposes. If you decide to upload the spreadsheet to your social media publishing&nbsp;software, it will not attach -- you'll have to do that with your marketing software. If you're a HubSpot customer, details for <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social-media-user-guide-v2/how-to-upload-social-media-messages-in-bulk-for-schedule-publishing\">how to bulk upload your Twitter content to Social Inbox</a> can be found within the downloaded template.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Facebook Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Now, let's talk about how to plan your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing\">Facebook marketing</a>&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Facebook Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=304&amp;name=social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Facebook content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"304\" /></p> \n<p>Facebook updates work similarly to Twitter updates, with the exception being bulk uploading your content is not possible in Social Inbox.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Head on over to the column labeled \"Message\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your status update, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run.&nbsp;Then, move to the \"Link\" column and input the link you'll be, you know, linking to in the update. (Don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.) If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image just like you did with your Twitter updates -- if you're using one, we suggest you edit it to be 1200 x 900 pixels.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your LinkedIn Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>LinkedIn updates are the most unique, because you have both Company Pages and Groups to consider. To demonstrate the difference between Company Page updates and Group updates, let's navigate over to the column labeled \"Title (For Group Discussions Only).\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=227&amp;name=social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for LinkedIn content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"227\" /></p> \n<p>LinkedIn Groups let you post a few kinds of updates, one of which is called a \"Discussion.\" You will only fill out the \"Title (For Group Discussions Only)\" column if you're looking to post a Discussion to your LinkedIn Group -- because Discussions are the only update you'll be posting that requires a title. If you're not posting a Discussion to a LinkedIn Group, you don't need to fill out this field, because your update will not have a title.</p> \n<p>You'll fill out the next column, \"Message,\" for every type of update you post, whether it's for a Company Page or a Group. Simply input your copy into this column, and then navigate to the next two columns, \"Link\" and \"Campaign\" to input the URL to which you're directing readers with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">the tracking token</a> you'll use to track&nbsp;activity, and the associated campaign if one exists. If you'd like to use an image for an update, attach it per the instructions laid out in the \"Twitter\" section. We recommend editing the image to 700 x 520 pixels.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Instagram Posting Calendar</h3> \n<p>Now, let's move on to&nbsp;how to set up your Instagram&nbsp;photos and videos&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Instagram&nbsp;Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=187&amp;name=social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Instagram content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"187\" /></p> \n<p>Instagram&nbsp;updates work similarly to Facebook&nbsp;updates, in that content can't be uploaded in bulk to&nbsp;Social Inbox&nbsp;like it can with Twitter.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Head on over to the column labeled \"Message,\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your post's caption, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run. Keep in mind that although Instagram captions can be up to&nbsp;2,200 characters long, they&nbsp;cut off in users' feeds after three lines of text. The exact length of these three lines depends on the length of your Instagram handle.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-limit-social-media-blog-posts\">Read this blog post for a full character count guide</a>.)</p> \n<p>Next, move to the \"Link for Bio\" column and input whichever link you plan to put in the bio when you publish the accompanying Instagram post. (The reason you'd put a link in your bio and not the photo caption itself is because clickable URLs aren't allowed anywhere except the single \"website\" box in your bio.) Oh, and&nbsp;don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.</p> \n<p>If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image just like you did with your other social media&nbsp;updates -- we suggest you edit it to be 1080 pixels x 1080 pixels.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Pinterest Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Alright, now let's go over&nbsp;how to set up your Pinterest pins&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Pinterest Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=246&amp;name=social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Pinterest content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"246\" /></p> \n<p>Pinterest&nbsp;updates work similarly to Facebook and Instagram updates, in that content can't be uploaded in bulk to&nbsp;Social Inbox&nbsp;like it can with Twitter.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Go to&nbsp;the column labeled \"Message,\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your pin's description, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run. Then, move to the \"Link\" column and input the link you'll be, you know, linking to in the update. (Don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.)</p> \n<p>If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image like you did with your other social media&nbsp;updates -- we suggest you edit it to be&nbsp;735 pixels x 1102 pixels.</p> \n<h3>Content Repository (Or, Where to Source Social Media Content)<strong><br /></strong></h3> \n<p>This template also provides you with a tab&nbsp;called \"Content Repository,\" which should help you keep track of all your content and maintain a healthy backlog of fodder&nbsp;to make sourcing social media content easier.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-content-repository.png?width=669&amp;height=146&amp;name=social-media-calendar-content-repository.png\" alt=\"social media content calendar's content repository\" title=\"social-media-calendar-content-repository.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"146\" /></p> \n<p>As you create more assets, you'll likely want to resurface and re-promote those pieces down the line, too.&nbsp;To ensure you don't lose track of all of that content, record it on this tab so you're never at a loss for what to publish on social. If the content you're promoting isn't evergreen, be sure to include an expiration date in the column marked \"Expiration\" so you don't promote it when it's&nbsp;jumped the shark.</p> \n<p>This tab will also help&nbsp;you maintain&nbsp;a healthy balance of content: A mix of your own content and others', a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-social-media-popularity\">mix of content formats and types</a>, and mix of lead generation content vs. MQL-generating content vs. traffic-friendly content.</p> \n<h2>Don't Forget to Interact With Your Followers</h2> \n<p>Whether you use this spreadsheet to plan your content out in advance or upload to a third-party app, you'll still need to supplement these updates with one the fly content. Breaking news hits? Whip up a quick update to share it with your network. Someone in your network tweets something interesting? Give it <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27675/How-to-Retweet-the-Right-Way-in-4-Easy-Steps.aspx\">a retweet with some commentary</a>. Got a fascinating comment on one of your updates? Respond with a \"thank you\" for their interaction or an additional follow-up comment.</p> \n<p>Coming up with and scheduling your social media content in advance is a huge time-saver, but it should go without saying that you still need to monitor and add to your social presence throughout the day.</p> \n<p>Finally, we encourage you to experiment with your social media publishing. This template provides publishing dates and times for each social network, but you may find those are way too many updates for you to fill, or perhaps too infrequent for your booming social presence. You should adjust your social media publishing frequency as needed.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in January 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33415%2Fthe-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 20:30:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"92d64e36547482ed94ebef3931c86768","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-calendar-excel-tabs.jpg?width=1362&name=content-calendar-excel-tabs.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-22-279_f90ca5b0d2e1dd8f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-month-view.png?width=669&height=388&name=social-media-calendar-month-view.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn81@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-25-079_7d00700896f17a6c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png?width=669&height=296&name=social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn74@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-24-928_ce0511f1fed07ad1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png?width=669&height=304&name=social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn94@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-28-539_07245d8e730a20df.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png?width=669&height=227&name=social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn86@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-27-601_631c08300d61d1fe.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png?width=669&height=187&name=social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-19-947_04f3c97e99e56140.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png?width=669&height=246&name=social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn90@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-25-823_936d284f402305c8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-content-repository.png?width=669&height=146&name=social-media-calendar-content-repository.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-19-956_89718392f4e99aed.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33415%2Fthe-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn10@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-28-664_0003b1a836e6591f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336432},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"The Top Benefits of Marketing Automation","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation-benefits","description":"<p>For some reason, whenever I hear the words \"marketing automation,\" I think of the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film)\">Transformers</a>\" movie with Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox.</p> \n<p>It makes me think of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobot\">Autobots</a> doing all our marketing -- which would be pretty cool.</p>  \n<p>But today, we're not going to be talking about the robots from Cybertron.</p> \n<p>Instead, let's focus on how marketing automation can benefit your business. Marketing automation is the process of making systems or processes occur automatically within a software.</p> \n<p>Essentially, marketing automation can help streamline your marketing efforts and make your department more efficient.</p> \n<p>In today's post, let's review the top benefits of marketing automation.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Efficiency.</h3> \n<p>First and foremost, marketing automation makes your entire department more efficient. You can potentially reduce staffing costs while freeing up your team's time to work on more important, strategic projects.</p> \n<p>Instead of manually posting on social media every day, marketing automation software can automate that process.</p> \n<p>This means that your team can do more creative work, like planning and brainstorming for upcoming campaigns and projects.</p> \n<p>Additionally, working in an automation platform will make your team's tasks easier. Your staff can post on social media, create an email nurturing campaign, post a blog, or create a landing page all in the same software. Ultimately, this saves your team time when you're creating campaigns.</p> \n<h3>2. Marketing and sales alignment.</h3> \n<p>If you combine your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/crm-marketing-automation\">sales and marketing automation</a> efforts by using the same software, you'll be able to align company goals and efforts.</p> \n<p>Essentially, it'll make the process of going from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-qualified-lead\">marketing qualified lead to sales qualified lead</a> that much easier.</p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/marketing-automation/\">marketing automation can lead to a 14.5% increase in sales productivity and a 12.2% reduction in marketing overhead</a>.</p> \n<p>Plus, it can also help you generate more leads and increase sales. Your marketing team will spend more time strategizing ways to increase conversion rate, while your sales team increases productivity. It's a win-win.</p> \n<h3>3. Increase conversion rate.</h3> \n<p>Speaking of increasing conversion rates, marketing automation can also make your team more effective.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation-software-tools\">Marketing automation software</a> can help you increase your conversion rate and manage your leads more efficiently.</p> \n<p>Your marketing automation software will track your leads and you can even use it to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide\">retarget</a> your website visitors who don't convert, increasing your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide\">CRO</a>.</p> \n<p>Again, marketing automation should give your team more time to analyze your marketing strategy and consider how to get visitors to convert.</p> \n<h3>4. Accurate reporting.</h3> \n<p>Reporting your analytics can seem like a daunting process, but with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation-ecommerce\">marketing automation platforms</a>, it doesn't have to be.</p> \n<p>You should be able to use your software to generate automated reports. All of a sudden, a cumbersome task is simplified.</p> \n<p>Additionally, marketing automation platforms can give you a high-level overview of your overall process. This will help you see complications and friction points. With accurate, streamlined reporting you can see where things are going wrong.</p> \n<p>Do leads drop off during your lead nurturing email campaigns? Or is it during your sales process? Either way, accurate analytics will help you spot those points and fix them in a timely manner.</p> \n<h3>5. Personalized marketing strategy.</h3> \n<p>As your team spends more time creating instead of doing manual data entry, marketing automation software will allow them to create more personalized content through its segmentation capabilities and reporting.</p> \n<p>With marketing automation, you can target your persona on multiple channels. You can target them on social media, with search ads, or through email campaigns.</p> \n<p>How does marketing automation facilitate this?</p> \n<p>Well, marketing automation turns your web visitors into leads and once you know who your leads are, you can segment them by behavior or characteristics.</p> \n<p>The entire lead nurturing process should be personalized -- did someone read a post about sales conferences? Maybe your lead nurturing email invites them to a sales conference your team is hosting.</p> \n<p>This way your leads get personalized messaging and you can track their engagement. This will also help with lead scoring.</p> \n<h3>6. Lead scoring.</h3> \n<p>Marketing automation software can set up lead scoring for your team which will notify your sales team when a lead goes from marketing qualified lead to a sales qualified lead.</p> \n<p>Again, this speaks to the better alignment between your marketing and sales teams. Plus, it automates the process, which makes it easier and in real-time. This means no time is wasted and your sales team can reach out to prospects immediately.</p> \n<h3>7. Data management.</h3> \n<p>Not to repeat myself, but marketing automation platforms will keep track of your leads and their engagement with your site.</p> \n<p>That means that managing your data is easier than ever. Plus, it keeps your data up to date automatically.</p> \n<h3>8. Scalable processes.</h3> \n<p>Whenever you set up your marketing systems and processes, it's important to keep scale in mind. Can this process grow with your company? If it's not scalable, then it will be hard for your company to expand.</p> \n<p>Marketing automation will help you create processes that are scalable. The more manual a process is and the more it depends on one person, the harder it'll be to scale when the team grows.</p> \n<h3>9. Lead nurturing.</h3> \n<p>Last but not least, marketing automation makes <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/7-effective-lead-nurturing-tactics\">lead nurturing</a> possible. Marketing automation software is the place you'll create drip email campaigns and track their success.</p> \n<p>Without lead nurturing, you'll have a harder time converting leads to sales prospects.</p> \n<p>Now, it's not just me who promotes marketing automation. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime\">Optimus Prime</a> actually believes that marketing automation is one of the best ways to create a marketing program that will grow with your company. Plus, it can even align other departments like sales and customer service.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-automation-benefits&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 08:30:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"86f455142ebe755c4bf0d7be6725cb59","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-automation-benefits&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-20-020_f8c57211ab218228.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336425},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Social Media Analytics","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-analytics","description":"<p>There are over <a href=\"https://wearesocial.com/blog/2020/01/digital-2020-3-8-billion-people-use-social-media\">3.8 billion social media users</a> across the globe.</p> \n<p>As you can probably imagine, that’s a major reason why businesses want to be active on social, too.

Again, you can think of this as your social media analytics strategy.</p> \n<h3>1. Set SMART social media analytics goals.</h3> \n<p>Create and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">set SMART goals</a> to help you achieve your social media analytics goals. By ensuring your goals are SMART, they’ll be Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound — meaning, you’ll be able to focus your strategy to reach or even exceed your expectations efficiently.</p> \n<p>To begin, ask yourself, “What do I want to learn from my social media analytics?” Then, dive into each part of the SMART goal. Here’s an example of a SMART goal related to your social media analytics strategy for reference.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase&amp;_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Use a free template to help you create SMART goals and achieve them</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Specific:</strong> I want to use social media analytics to identify specific data points related to my marketing tactics to determine which posts and campaigns are working best in reaching and engaging our audience members.</li> \n <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> I want to be able to identify some specific data points to accomplish this goal.</li> \n <li><strong>Attainable: </strong>I will work to identify <em>three</em> specific data points to help accomplish this goal.</li> \n <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> These data points will help my team and I measure our success in reaching and engaging our audience members across social media channels as well as identify any gaps or areas for improvement in our social media strategy.</li> \n <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> I want to identify these specific data points over the course of the next month — this way, in four week’s time, we can begin using them to measure our success in reaching and engaging audience members across social channels and identify gaps and areas for improvement in our social media strategy.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Decide which metrics you’ll and focus on and track.</h3> \n<p>Now it’s time to decide which <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-metrics-ceos-cares-about?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">social media metrics</a> you’re going to track. There are a number of commonly-tracked social media metrics for your consideration. Metrics may vary by social platform as well as which analytics tool you chose. But, here are some all-encompassing metrics applicable to virtually every social channel and analytics tool to get started.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Reach</strong> is the total number of people who have seen your content.</li> \n <li><strong>Engagements</strong> are all interactions including shares, likes, and comments.</li> \n <li><strong>Impressions</strong> are the number of times or content is displayed on someone’s feed.</li> \n <li><strong>Mentions</strong> are the times your business and brand are referenced on social media by audience members or other businesses.</li> \n <li><strong>Social ROI</strong> provides insight into whether the investment you've put into your social media marketing is resulting in an increase or decrease in customers, sales, brand awareness, and customer loyalty.</li> \n <li><strong>Social listening</strong> is when you monitor conversations about your business and brand on social to see what customers and audience members are saying about you.</li> \n <li><strong>Likes</strong> are when an audience member taps (or double taps) on your social content to show they’re a fan of your post.</li> \n <li><strong>Retweets/shares/reposts</strong> are when audience members post the content your business published on their profiles.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Determine which social media analytics tools you’ll use.</h3> \n<p>Next, determine which social media analytics tools you’ll use — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-analytics#social-media-analytics-tools\">we covered some popular choices above</a> but you can always review other options through a simple Google search.</p> \n<p>Before making a decision regarding which tool or tools you’ll use, think about the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you want a tool or software to help you manage your social media analytics across multiple channels and platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) or just one (e.g. Twitter)?</li> \n <li>Which metrics did you decide you’re going to track (as we touched on in the above step)?</li> \n <li>What is your budget? Do you need a tool with flexible pricing options and features that you can add to or remove from over time? (To find this information, review the pricing pages like <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/pricing/\">this page on Sprout Social’s website</a>.)</li> \n <li>Which tools and software options are suited to help you achieve the SMART goals you set? (Check out feature pages for this type of information, like <a href=\"https://www.oktopost.com/platform/social-media-analytics\">this page on Oktopost’s website</a>.)</li> \n <li>Do you want your tool to integrate with the greater software your team uses to run your business (such as <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">HubSpot’s CRM</a>, for example)?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Measure the success of your social media analytics efforts.</h3> \n<p>Once you implement your social media analytics software, you’ll be able to measure the success of your efforts. To do this, you may use the analytics tool you implemented — depending on your software, you might have the ability to create customized reports and dashboards or pull the specific details about data points you care most about.</p> \n<p>In addition to applying your tools to help measure your success, you may also consider your answers to the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Did you achieve your SMART goals?</li> \n <li>Did the metrics you chose to focus on tell a story that’s helpful for your business?</li> \n <li>Did the software or tool you implemented support your business needs?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Make necessary social media analytics adjustments.</h3> \n<p>Once you measure the success of your social media analytics efforts, you’ll be able to determine whether or not any part of your strategy needs to be changed or updated.</p> \n<p>Maybe you realize one of your data points isn’t providing the level of insight into your marketing efforts across social platforms, so you need to identify a new one to measure. Maybe your software doesn’t allow you to customize cross-channel reports the way you want to, so you need to implement a new tool. Or, if you’re happy with the way your social media analytics reporting and strategy is working, be sure to revisit your strategy in the future to ensure it continues meeting your expectations.</p> \n<h2>Begin Tracking and Applying Social Media Analytics</h2> \n<p>By tracking and applying the process of social media analytics to your strategy, you’ll be able to more effectively reach your audience. And when you do this, you’ll see improvements in factors that are directly tied to your ROI like engagement, conversions, loyalty, and more.</p> \n<p>Consider which tools and software are best for you and determine how you’ll track your social media analytics to create deeper relationships with your customers and followers.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in March 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsocial-media-analytics&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 11:30:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0c2d9d4da0ca1a9d53c2f5a806f89e7b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"krbaker@hubspot.com (Kristen Baker)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-3.png?width=1500&name=Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-21-006_1d782f113eca95aa.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020.png?width=1500&name=Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn38@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-27-011_fc3252e85145593e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-6.png?width=1500&name=Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-6.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn37@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-21-923_70ebf99985e0356e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-1.png?width=1500&name=Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-28-253_fd9455e5805de46a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-7.png?width=1500&name=Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-7.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-25-461_81b47f533599e210.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-4.png?width=1500&name=Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-25-572_08ba614e6441388f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-2.png?width=1500&name=Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn89@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-26-730_f5ec5772b9991c12.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-5.png?width=1500&name=Social%20Media%20Analytics%20%E2%80%94%20NNP%20Pillar,%20Marketing%20Blog,%20SIR%20Q1%2020-5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn86@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-23-033_6b181701877c58e4.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsocial-media-analytics&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn24@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-20-017_2bc87f19a7f351dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336429},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"What's an Implementation Partner & How Do You Work With One?","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/implementation-partner","description":"<p>In college, I took a class on graphic design. One requirement for the class was to have working knowledge of Adobe. Since most of us in the class had no idea how to use Adobe's expansive design suite, my school invited an implementation partner to visit and show us the ropes.</p>  \n<p>Someone from the partnering agency came to our class and demonstrated how to use the tools we had for InDesign to maximize our success in the class. I loved this presentation because it was created just for our group — the presenter polled us about what we wanted to learn and delivered relevant information based on that feedback.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>I would've definitely struggled with using the software had it not been for the agency partner. I loved the experience, and it gave me an understanding of just how amazing implementation partners can be for the companies they support.</p> \n<p>Implementation partners work directly with your customers to ensure they're getting the most out of your product. You can think of an implementation partner in the same way you think about tech support. Often, tech support agents are certified by the company they work for to give actionable solutions for problems.</p> \n<p>The difference between tech support and implementation partners is that the latter can benefit from an increase in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness?_ga=2.81757138.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">brand awareness</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?_ga=2.81757138.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">leads</a>. If you work with them, you can offer their services to those who might need help with your tools past onboarding.</p> \n<p>If you offer software that takes time to implement and learn, like a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms?_ga=2.15763699.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">CMS</a>, you might look into working with implementation partners. They would be separate from the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-onboarding?_ga=2.15763699.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">onboarding team</a> you already have set in place. Their focus would be to give an in-depth training about your product, designed just for that customer.</p> \n<p>You might use implementation partners if you want to offer consumers alternate methods to learn how to use your technology. Implementation partners have the bandwidth parent companies may not have when offering personalized solutions. In other words, a \"do-it-for-me\" approach is more feasible with partners.</p> \n<p>For customers, implementation partners can be a cost-effective solution for selecting and understanding your services. If you charge an onboarding fee some can't afford, for instance, partners with lower overhead may offer lower prices. This way, you wouldn't miss out on a customer with a more restrictive budget and can be assured they're getting a proper onboarding experience.</p> \n<p>Additionally, some partners can handle larger customers, and they can meet customer needs as your business scales. For instance, one of <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/agencies?_ga=2.15763699.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot's agency partners</a>, <a href=\"https://impact.com/\">IMPACT</a>, specializes in helping large teams acclimate to their software. They offer an interactive training program that's designed specifically for the business they're working with.</p> \n<p>So, that's what implementation partners are — now let's talk about how to work with them.</p> \n<h2>How to Work With Implementation Partners</h2> \n<p>The relationship your company has with implementation agencies should be mutually beneficial. The agency can look forward to more work and customers. Additionally, customers will have multiple onboarding options, some at lower costs, to your benefit. Let's talk about how to maximize your relationship with partners.</p> \n<h3>1. Set up a program or process for partnerships.</h3> \n<p>HubSpot has an implementation program called <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/partners/solutions?_ga=2.15763699.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">Solutions Partners</a>. Agencies proficient in HubSpot's offerings can apply to be a partner and have their website listed on the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/agencies?_ga=2.85806684.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">Agencies</a> page. This page is where HubSpot customers go to locate outside help with implementation, social strategy, and more.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20an%20Implementation%20Partner%20%26%20How%20Do%20You%20Work%20With%20One%3F.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/agencies\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>Consider creating a similar program that facilitates focused and organized agreements. You'll already know what you're looking for in an agency, as well as what you intend to get out of the partnership.</p> \n<p>Keep the purpose of the program in mind during the design process. Choose agencies that honor this goal. In addition, outline what your company can offer the agency. For instance, HubSpot partners can enjoy a website feature, a space for reviews, and the approval from the company as a valued source for onboarding.</p> \n<h3>2. Identify co-marketing opportunities with prospects.</h3> \n<p>When you begin to look for prospective partners, identify<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34188/what-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx?_ga=2.85806684.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\"> co-marketing opportunities</a>.</p> \n<p>This is because partners can enjoy the chance to win awards for their work. Agencies can display awards, tiers, or badges on their websites as well as company-approved program designs.</p> \n<p>Consider similar co-marketing ideas as you search and select partners. Communicate how all parties can benefit. For incentives, you can give awards based on success, offer quotes for webpages, and even launch a new onboarding process.</p> \n<p>For example, if there's an agency in your network that's pioneered a revolutionary method in onboarding customers, debut a joint campaign to generate more leads and interest in the program.</p> \n<h3>3. Make sure agencies are well-versed in your product.</h3> \n<p>This seems like a no-brainer, but it's critical to partner with agencies whose teams are experts in your product(s). If your company offers a certification course, you can make that a requirement in the application process.</p> \n<p>You can also make it a requirement for agencies to have a certain level of success using your offerings. For instance, if you offer a CMS, you can set the expectation that agencies who have at least 500 customers can apply to help SMB customers.</p> \n<p>Make sure your method gives agencies a clearly defined way to show their expertise with your product. Look for their knowledge of offerings, mission, and vision, in tandem with their know-how. Remember, agencies should deliver an experience on-par with your company’s own offering.</p> \n<h3>4. Have an easy application process.</h3> \n<p>Even though you should be selective with approving partners, it's important to make your process accessible. Make the application flexible so every interested agency can show their work. You might find a rockstar partnership that way.</p> \n<p>For instance, at some companies, all agencies need is proof of previous success and experience with the software. From there, they can expect a short interview period.</p> \n<p>An easy application process will also be able to scale as your business grows. A two-step application is easier to manage as your company acquires more leads and broader goals. In addition, agencies that are interested in partnering with your company might be more inclined to apply if the steps are simple.</p> \n<h3>5. Make sure agencies can deliver highly technical solutions.</h3> \n<p>Agencies should be well-versed in the product <em>and</em> capable of delivering solutions. Solutions, in this realm, generally come in two forms: Results-driven, and those that are technical.</p> \n<p>In the results-driven category, implementation partners need to locate where customers are having problems with the software, then identify solutions. For instance, if a company can't figure out how to use workflows to organize leads, the agency should be able to identify that, then show customers a fix that maximizes their software.</p> \n<p>Fixing that workflow should improve organization between members of the team and drive growth for the customer.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, maybe a customer can't figure out how to download a necessary extension. Agencies should have the know-how to lead customers toward the answer.</p> \n<p>If your company offers a certification, consider whether it’s intensive enough for an agency application point. And consider developing a new course that covers the extra material companies should know about in order to be a successful partner.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, develop a test or video challenge agencies must complete. At HubSpot, partners specializing in <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales?_ga=2.10322160.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">Sales Hub</a> have to upload a video that shows proof of a highly-technical, results-driven solution. Consider developing a case study agencies must complete to apply.</p> \n<p>Make sure your method for partnerships accurately demonstrates the agencies' expertise with your product. For example, a five-question quiz might not be the best route, but an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/quiz-maker?_ga=2.10322160.434658601.1597805933-940436819.1565181751\">interactive test</a> could be better. A test could tap into each area of your software, and the interactive elements would give agencies the chance to put their own spin on your questions.</p> \n<p>Implementation partners are an amazing way to grow the network within your business. You can begin to foster an ecosystem of users with agencies that help onboard customers. Agencies should have the capabilities to adapt to the way your company sells and serves customers — kind of like the gift that keeps on giving.</p> \n<p>If you're interested in starting a partner program, you're all set to begin. Don't forget to keep your customers at the core of your planning, and you'll make extremely valuable partnerships that can help your business grow. Good luck, and happy onboarding.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fimplementation-partner&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20an%20Implementation%20Partner%20%26%20How%20Do%20You%20Work%20With%20One%3F.png","linkMd5":"2ee6f405d7b7cb7395752dd983825a92","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn68@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-16-746_c5d9df7adf736afb.webp","destWidth":1206,"destHeight":716,"sourceBytes":100314,"destBytes":100314,"author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20an%20Implementation%20Partner%20%26%20How%20Do%20You%20Work%20With%20One%3F.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn68@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-16-746_c5d9df7adf736afb.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fimplementation-partner&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-20-054_fcf3e71cd71746f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336425},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"Instagram Influencer Marketing Myths, Debunked","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-influencer-myths","description":"<p>Growing up for me, becoming an influencer wasn't a job someone could aspire to be.</p> \n<p>But nowadays, it's a job that kids dream of and an industry that impacts young adults purchasing decisions.</p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/influencers-more-likely-to-inspire-gen-zer-and-millennial-purchases\">in 2019 22% of Gen Z, 20% of millennials, and 16% of Gen X have made a purchase inspired by an influencer post on social media</a>.</p>  \n<p>At this point, you might be wondering, <em>\"What's an influencer?\"</em></p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/what-is-an-influencer/\">Influencer Marketing Hub</a>, \"An influencer is someone who has the power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of their authority, knowledge, position, or relationship with their audience.\"</p> \n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewdelaney/\">Andrew Delaney</a>, a senior manager on the HubSpot social media team, says, \"We are all influencers every time we choose to post. We could be suggesting or recommending a location, a business, an item, or another person by taking the action of sharing that content in the first place. In each of these instances, we are influential, even when we are not trying to directly influence.\"</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\">influencer industry</a> has been around for over a decade now, and a lot of myths about the industry have circulated in that time.</p> \n<p>In this post, let's review the top influencer marketing myths that have been debunked.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Influencer marketing is diminishing in popularity.</h3> \n<p>When social media first came on the scene, a lot of old-school businesses were hesitant to adopt it as a major marketing tactic. The influencer industry has been no different.</p> \n<p>Many organizations haven't adopted influencer marketing in their ongoing marketing strategy because they think it's a fad that will diminish in popularity.</p> \n<p>However, that isn't correct.</p> \n<p>In 2018 alone there were <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">3.7 million brand-sponsored influencer posts on Instagram</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/en-us/blog/20-influencer-marketing-statistics-that-will-surprise-you\">49% of consumers</a> today depend on influencer recommendations for their purchase decisions. <a href=\"https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/en-us/blog/20-influencer-marketing-statistics-that-will-surprise-you#\">60%</a> say they've been influenced by a recommendation when shopping in-store.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalwu/\">Krystal Wu</a>, a social media community manager at HubSpot, \"The Instagram influencer marketing trend is not and will not, in the near future be canceled. With businesses relying more on social media, now more than ever, influencer marketing is helping businesses reach larger audiences.\"</p> \n<p>She added, \"Think about it like this -- influencers on Instagram are the new model examples on how products wear, work, function, and are used rather than in-store experiences.\"</p> \n<h3>2. You shouldn't use smaller accounts.</h3> \n<p>One of the most prominent myths of influencer marketing is that you need to use large accounts to see results.</p> \n<p>However, the opposite is often true.</p> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/micro-influencer-marketing\">micro-influencers</a> seem like a small player in the influencer marketing game, in a recent study, <a href=\"https://www.marketingdive.com/news/micro-influencers-have-major-impact-on-buying-behavior-study/416579/\">82% of respondents</a> said they were \"highly likely to follow a micro-influencers' recommendation.\"</p> \n<p>So, how does this work in practice?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicoleperegrina/\">Nicole Acosta</a>, a social media and marketing manager at <a href=\"https://www.ironphysicaltherapy.com/\">Iron Physical Therapy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thomasedison.org/\">Edison Innovation Foundation</a>, says, \"Instagram influencers don't have to have a huge following to be effective. They only need an engaged following.\"</p> \n<p>This means that you don't have to spend a large amount of money on your influencer marketing.</p> \n<p>Acosta added, \"Choose people who may not have hundreds of thousands of followers but have clear authority in their niche because their followers will trust their opinion and engage more with the content they make for you (which is the whole point!).\"</p> \n<p>Another expert, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raquelswan/\">Raquel Swan</a>, agreed with Acosta's assessment.</p> \n<p>Swan, a social media coordinator at <a href=\"https://digitalstandout.com/\">Digital Standout</a>, says, \"Brands need to carefully select their influencers and ensure that the followers and the influencers relate to the product or service offering to have a successful marketing campaign.\"</p> \n<p>HubSpot's social media campaign manager, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/leslie-green\">Leslie Green</a>, concurred.</p> \n<p>Green says, \"Partnering with an influencer with tons of followers doesn't guarantee tons of sales. Don't breeze over the power of nano-influencers who have built meaningful relationships with their audience and are incredible content creators and storytellers.\"</p> \n<p>The point here is that more followers don't always equal more sales. If the key performance indicator (KPI) is conversion, then you should look into using micro-influencers.</p> \n<p>\"The trust micro-influencers have fostered is way more valuable than you think. And in the end, everyone is an influencer. As a brand, it's so important to do your research and make sure the partnership makes sense for the audience and feels authentic to the influencer. Don't just become starry-eyed from a massive following,\" Green added.</p> \n<h3>3. Influencers will be hard to work with.</h3> \n<p>Another popular myth is that influencers aren't professional. Many people think they're shallow or untrustworthy.</p> \n<p>On the contrary, influencers are actually entrepreneurs and content creators whose reputation impacts their ability to make a living.</p> \n<p>Two digital content creators/influencers, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kimiaskravings/\">Kimia Kalbasi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lordmartin_/\">Martin Tettey</a>, found this myth to be the most misleading.</p> \n<p>Kalbasi, founder/influencer at <a href=\"https://kimiaskravings.com/\">Kimia's Kravings</a>, says, \"A myth is that all influencers are shallow or disingenuous. There are people like that in all walks of life regardless of their job title but because influencers are at the forefront of social media, put themselves out there, and showcase their lifestyle, it's perceived otherwise. But they're human, too.\"</p> \n<p>Tettey, a <a href=\"https://www.martintettey.com/\">successful writer</a>, wears many hats. He's a client consultant at <a href=\"http://www.mccannworldgroup.com/\">McCann WorldGroup</a>, a co-chair of diversity &amp; inclusion at <a href=\"https://www.prsa.org/\">PRSA</a>, and a digital content creator on Instagram.</p> \n<p>He says, \"Influencers are often ridiculed as self-absorbed people who try to sell things they don't believe in when that's not always true. A vast majority of influencers gave up their full-time careers as architects or engineers to pursue a life worth creating according to their passions.\"</p> \n<p>Essentially, influencers are entrepreneurs and content creators.</p> \n<p>\"Many people, like myself, love food, interior design, and travel. The best way to create inspiration for others was to create a personal brand on social media and a blog that is fully aligned and dedicated to my passion and various creative journeys that inspire myself and many others,\" Tettey added.</p> \n<h3>4. You won't see results if you work with influencers.</h3> \n<p>The name of the game is ROI and you might be thinking that you won't see results if you work with influencers.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"https://mediakix.com/influencer-marketing-resources/influencer-marketing-industry-statistics-survey-benchmarks/#gs.cwtjta\">80% of marketers</a> say influencer marketing is effective, and 89% say it works just as well (if not better) than other marketing channels.</p> \n<p>You might deduce that when you're deciding on which marketing channels to use, it's important to consider influencer marketing.</p> \n<p>Almost <a href=\"http://www.ion.co/twitter-has-released-a-report-showing-consumers-seek-product-recommendations-from-influencers-almost-as-much-as-they-do-from-friends\">50% of customers</a> say they follow influencers' product or service recommendations.</p> \n<p>Additionally, according to HubSpot's <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Not Another State of Marketing Report</a>, over 10% of respondents said influencer posts are among the most successful content for engaging your social audience.</p> \n<h3>5. You won't get quality referrals from influencers.</h3> \n<p>Similar to the point above, many people inaccurately assume that referrals from influencers won't be qualified leads.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"http://mediakix.com/2019/02/influencer-marketing-effectiveness/#gs.cwxh8w\">70% of businesses</a> say the quality of traffic from influencers is better than from other sources.</p> \n<p>That's why it's important to look at influencer marketing when you're planning your marketing strategy for the year.</p> \n<h3>6. Success is hard to measure.</h3> \n<p>Calculating ROI is a major challenge in marketing. That's why people assume it's hard to measure success for influencer marketing as well.</p> \n<p>However, that's not exactly true.</p> \n<p>Influencer marketing can be measured with normal KPIs including engagement, conversion rate, and impressions.</p> \n<p>You could even run a brand awareness campaign. In fact, influencer marketing strategies focused on branding or engagements generate <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-2019-benchmark-report/\">8x the ROI</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. My industry won't do well with influencer marketing.</h3> \n<p>While you might think that influencer marketing is just for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-of-influencer-marketing-campaigns\">B2C companies</a> in the beauty or fashion industry, there are influencers for every niche.</p> \n<p>In fact, even <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-hubspot-uses-influencer-marketing\">a B2B company like HubSpot</a> uses influencer marketing.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-giedris-b5536511a/\">Samantha Giedris</a>, a social media and video specialist at <a href=\"https://frazerconsultants.com/\">Frazer Consultants</a>, says \"There are influencers in every industry, no matter how niche it is. So it's worth looking into who has influence in your industry even if they're not exactly who you'd typically think of as influencers.\"</p> \n<p>Additionally, it's important to consider influencer marketing as a strategy even if you don't think it's for you.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegosantossic/?locale=en_US\">Diego Santos</a>, a marketing manager at HubSpot, said in the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Not Another State of Marketing Report</a>, \"Pay attention to private groups, micro-influencers and social movements that are relevant to your brand.\"</p> \n<h3>8. Influencer marketing isn't a legitimate form of marketing.</h3> \n<p>If I haven't convinced you yet, influencer marketing is a legitimate strategy, even if you've been guilty of believing this myth.</p> \n<p>In HubSpot's <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Not Another State of Marketing Report</a>, <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/lee-odden/\">Lee Odden</a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/\">TopRank Marketing</a>, is quoted saying, \"To win the content marketing game, brands need to focus more on optimized, personalized and influencer activated content experiences.\"</p> \n<p>If you haven't jumped on the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/influencer-marketing-power\">influencer marketing</a> bandwagon, it's probably time that you think about doing so. To start, you can create a strategy and brainstorm who the influencers are in your industry.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img

To ensure that we were creating such experiences, we first had to identify what novel problems and pain points this audience faces.</p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 24px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/education-partner-program\"><em>Click here to learn more about the Education Partner Program and how you can join.</em></a></p> \n<h2>Identifying Our Audience’s Pain Points</h2> \n<p>The EPP’s focus is on college students who need to enter the working world with the tools and methodologies they need to help a business grow. We care deeply, and invest heavily in, business education.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image1-Aug-17-2020-06-46-12-01-PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=image1-Aug-17-2020-06-46-12-01-PM.png\" alt=\"g2 grid online course providers hubspot\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Although HubSpot Academy serves thousands of learners across the world, the EPP focuses on education within college and universities. Our team would be remiss if we didn’t acknowledge and adapt to the educational inequity that pervades higher education in the US.</p> \n<p>Specifically, we wanted to address the problems below that these issues bring to light:</p> \n<h3>1. Students need to have experience applying the skills they learn in class to find employment after graduation.</h3> \n<p>Often, this means they pursue (sometimes unpaid) internships in expensive cities, which can add financial strain to an already expensive college experience.</p> \n<p>If HubSpot could find a way that would allow students to contribute virtually to helping solve a real business challenge in their course - all with the added safety net of their instructor being there to answer questions - we prime them for success. Subsequently, if they put this work on their resume, these students demonstrate a work experience that they might have otherwise been unable to find.</p> \n<h3>2. Educators have a mandate to prepare their students for real business challenges, but this can introduce so many unwelcome variables in the classroom.</h3> \n<p>Educations only have so many businesses in their rolodex that are open to working with students in their personal or professional network. On top of that, awkward conversations about expectations and due dates on deliverables can turn professors off from the experience completely.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we have over 78,000 customers, all of whom are hoping to grow their business using our software and many of which could use some help and fresh eyes when approaching new projects. However, we recognized that it wasn’t enough to simply offer our customers; we needed a way for both our customers and our professors to hold themselves accountable to creating fruitful relationships and learning experiences for the students they work with.</p> \n<h3>3. HubSpot customers don't always have the bandwidth to complete their many projects.</h3> \n<p>Although the visible impact of the Education Partner Program is the support we lend professors, we also intend to embedding ourselves deeper into the company and work across the many teams at HubSpot that want their best for our users. As a small team of three, it’s important for us to make a large splash where we can. Working with other teams - and specifically, our Customer Success Team - to help HubSpot customers is mutually beneficial. We wanted to find a solution for our educators while also finding one for our customers. We needed to create safeguards that made sure that business didn’t exploit students’ free labor while making it easy (and pleasant) for a Customer to work with an Educator, and vice versa.</p> \n<p>And so, in 2020, we decided to focus on …. applied learning.</p> \n<h2>Providing a Solution Through Applied Learning</h2> \n<p><strong>Applied learning</strong> is the practice of alternating classroom learning with pre-approved practical, meaningful, and creative contributions of labor in a community or external organization, in a field related to a student’s academic and career goals. Has a HubSpot Customer not updated their lead-generation workflow since the early 2010s? Perhaps some students could come in and provide some suggestions. Does a HubSpot Customer not have the bandwidth to create engaging blog articles to promote their product or service? Have students in a Digital Marketing class provide some articles as their capstone assignment!</p> \n<p>As higher education shifted to virtual or hybrid models in 2020, we had a unique value proposition to provide our educators with the opportunity to enhance their students’ employable skills while also providing free work for our customers — many of whom were adapting to the challenges of conducting business almost entirely online and could use the help.</p> \n<p>Here’s how we did it.</p> \n<h3>1. We partnered with the best-in-class software for creating new applied opportunities in the classroom, Riipen.</h3> \n<p>We first explored what providers already had a foothold in this space. <a href=\"https://www.riipen.com/\">Riipen</a>, a technology platform that facilitates micro-experiential learning opportunities by connecting students with industry partners through in-course assignments or competitions designed by instructors, <a href=\"https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/academics/experiential-learning/docs/Riipen-Instructions-for-Instructors.pdf\">came far ahead of any other options</a>.</p> \n<h3>2. We tested, and then tested some more.</h3> \n<p>Shortly after we decided to work with Riipen, we enlisted some of our most engaged Education Partners and customers to test out the marketplace to see if this was something we could expand to the hundreds more professors in our network.</p> \n<p>After a bit of research and conversation, we partnered with (and are eternally grateful for) Tim Marshall at Baldwin Wallace College and Elaine Young and Champlain College. These two educators’ students worked with six diverse HubSpot customers (three each), with much success.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.capa.org/\">CAPA The Global Education Network</a> (Boston, MA, USA): Students worked to develop lead-nurturing workflows to promote and encourage study abroad to freshmen college students.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.thewoodsmaine.com/\">The Woods </a>(Norway, ME, USA): Students worked to boost online ads and an ecommerce platform for a luxury treehouse in Maine.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.runawaytravelinc.com/\">Run Away Travel</a> (Miami, FL, USA): Students created marketing collateral and content for an all-inclusive travel agency.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.cosmicbooth.com/\">Cosmic Booth</a> (Orlando, FL, USA): Students created marketing collateral and content for a commercial photo booth rental business.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://ettch.org/\">ETTCH </a>(Dublin, Ireland): Students created marketing collateral and content for an educational company that design tools for children coping with anxiety and low self-confidence.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://airworks.io/\">AirWorks</a> (Boston, MA, USA): Students doubled the amount of pillar pages for an AI start-up.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>My colleagues and I attended final presentations that students made to their employers and were impressed with the level of preparation and professionalism from everyone involved.</p> \n<p>The Woods saw tremendous growth (500%) in their apparel sales. Run Away Travel and ETTCH in particular had some great feedback on the maturity of the students and the innovative content they provided their businesses.</p> \n<p>Given the success of the pilot program, we decided to continue our partnership with Riipen and create even more connections between our customers and educators.</p> \n<h3>3. We promoted our program internally and collaborated with other teams.</h3> \n<p>There were several considerations we took into account as we planned to launch our partnership with Riipen at scale.</p> \n<p>We needed to make sure that our educators weren’t left without a HubSpot customer to pair with — and vice versa. This meant that our biggest obstacle was going both too fast or too slow in rolling this out. We needed to make sure we were recruiting at an even pace on both sides of the marketplace. For example, if we pressed the gas on recruiting educators to join, we could end up with more educators than we have customers. The opposite also applied. Since we could control the stream of educators who knew about and could sign up for this program, we also had to do the same for our customers.</p> \n<p>Enter the Customer Success team at HubSpot. We relied on the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-success-manager\">Customer Success Managers</a>, or CSMs, to hand-pick “good fit” businesses for this opportunity. We shared the “what” and “why” of our applied learning program through an internal “Applied Learning Resource Center” with small, actionable steps for CSMs that wanted their customers to participate in the program. CSMs then introduced me personally to businesses they considered a good match. We also built out public-facing pages for educators and customers that outlined the goals and responsibilities of each should they participate in the program.</p> \n<h2>Applied Learning in Times of Uncertainty</h2> \n<p>While we at HubSpot have always been excited about the prospect of matching customers with educators so that students can gain job-ready skills, these times of economic uncertainty have brought a new sense of urgency. When we experience fundamental changes to how we work and learn, we have to question how we can better prepare ourselves and others to respond to new challenges. The practice of remote-friendly learning has become the new normal for most colleges and universities worldwide, opening the horizons of what virtual leadership and project management looks like when it happens from your kitchen or bedroom desk.</p> \n<p>The project-based learnings students undertake with Riipen are always completely virtual experiences. Thus, they’re more flexible and obtainable to a new group of students who could never commit to the tradition 9-5, in-office internship experience.</p> \n<p>We have a long way to go to scale this from the highly-personalized, one-on-one outreach we have now to a more automated, self-identifying, opt-in process for customers and educators. Fall 2020 will present some interesting challenges as we prepare to launch this to our Education Partner Community during a time when many are questioning the ability to offer virtual learning — much less virtual applied learning opportunities.</p> \n<p>We seek to create 15 more matches between Educators and our Customers (and even more in the Spring) and are confident that we can hit this number. Ultimately, we want to create opportunities for students to graduate with the skills and experiences they need to feel confident in interviews and at their workplaces.</p> \n<p>Our partnership with Riipen is a major step in empowering these students and in building a customer base that appreciates the perspectives that these students bring.</p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 24px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/education-partner-program\"><em>Click here to learn more about the Education Partner Program and how you can join.</em></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhubspot-experiment-applied-learning&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 11:30:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c87a19796c39256db352895b456a4a23","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Julia Gueron","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image2-1.png?width=1500&name=image2-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-21-187_f5b9d0020acde10b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image1-Aug-17-2020-06-46-12-01-PM.png?width=1500&name=image1-Aug-17-2020-06-46-12-01-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn69@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-28-274_f1c8f6f604e388ab.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhubspot-experiment-applied-learning&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn46@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-28-069_6f4fb33de4107334.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336424},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How to Find Your Business's White Space Opportunities","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/white-space-opportunity","description":"<p>When McDonald's first opened its doors, they had two items on the menu: burgers and fries. After surveying competitors, the founders saw that in order to stand out as a food company, they had to be different. Instead of offering a multitude of menu options, they decided to hyper-focus on the bestsellers, which catapulted their customer satisfaction.</p>  \n<p>What McDonalds' founders did was find white space opportunities in their industry. While other fast food restaurants at the time were offering a diverse menu but lacking in customer service — the McDonald's team decided to focus on two items so customer service would be at the forefront.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>By surveying what was missing from the market, McDonald's was able to grow into a billion-dollar empire. The founders saw what customers were lacking and turned that industry gap into a success.</p> \n<p>But what exactly are white space opportunities, and how can they be an asset to your company? Let's find out below.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, consumers don't know what they need until, well, they need it, so it's up to companies to be proactive. White space opportunities help marketers uncover customer needs that haven't yet been met.</p> \n<p>It's a useful tactic when identifying how to provide the most value to customers. But, because white space opportunities aren't as obvious as, say, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/keywords?_ga=2.258054088.373935806.1597717559-940436819.1565181751\">keyword opportunities</a>, it can be hard to know where to start.</p> \n<p>Sounds pretty taboo, right? How can businesses uncover value customers are looking for when the customer themselves aren't sure what they want? However, you may already have the right tools and knowledge at hand — they just need to be shaped for white space opportunities.</p> \n<p>Let's talk about what you can do to find white space for your company.</p> \n<h3>1. Innovate upon what you offer customers.</h3> \n<p>One of the best places to start with finding white space is within what you currently offer customers. Think of Apple's iPod. Apple's team probably came up with the idea to add a music player to their product stack by looking at what they already produce. Then, they figured out what other forms of entertainment they can make accessible with their resources.</p> \n<p>Consider identifying where, in your products, you can spot white space. Ask yourself where customer needs are and aren't being met. For example, if your blog team comes across a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?_ga=2.258054088.373935806.1597717559-940436819.1565181751\">topic with high interest</a> from your followers, but haven't written about it yet, that's white space.</p> \n<p>Then, you can decide how to innovate: Are you going to write a series of posts about the topic, include subcategories for smaller posts, or turn the topic into an ebook?</p> \n<h3>2. Target a different audience segment.</h3> \n<p>If you're struggling to find where you can innovate for a certain audience, maybe it's time to shift your focus. Consider targeting a different part of your audience. For instance, if you're hyper-focused on providing value for your content marketing audience segment, consider the white space you might have for SEO audiences.</p> \n<p>Let's say you're in charge of a social media marketing agency focused on B2B clients in the technology sphere. Well, there are plenty of those — and yours is getting lost in the shuffle. Time to find white space.</p> \n<p>Instead of marketing your company as one focused on B2B clients in technology, you decide to shift your customer base to one that serves B2B developers. While this is still in the technology space, your focus on a different audience segment allows you to reach out to a market that's not as saturated in your industry.</p> \n<h3>3. Ask customers how they use your products.</h3> \n<p>Research how customers fit your offerings into their day-to-day. You might find white space you didn't know existed.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you're part of a company that focuses on chatbot software, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/surveys?_ga=2.258054088.373935806.1597717559-940436819.1565181751\">survey your customers</a> and ask them for their <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies?_ga=2.258054088.373935806.1597717559-940436819.1565181751\">stories</a>. Ask them how your services fit into their companies and webpages.</p> \n<p>Let's say you find that customers really enjoy using your chatbots for lead nurturing on ecommerce sites. That's an area you missed during the initial launch, but knowing this, your team can now work on making chatbots more online shopping-friendly. Maybe you add a way for your customers to demo their products and prices within the chat.</p> \n<p>That white space will help you serve your customers and improve their selling strategy.</p> \n<h3>4. Find where your company is different.</h3> \n<p>Imagine you're in charge of an analytics software company. Aware that there's a countless number of those companies in the market, you're struggling to find white space.</p> \n<p>In your business plan, you recognized that your company is going to be an easy-to-use, intuitive platform. That's the element that sets you apart from competitors. That's white space.</p> \n<p>A lot of <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics?_ga=2.258054088.373935806.1597717559-940436819.1565181751\">analytics and reporting</a> software is hard to implement. Yours eliminates the struggle of turning numbers into results. Your company is going to be the one that's user-friendly — even a newbie can find success.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can use this discovery to find the most qualified leads. If your company is struggling to find white space, revisit your business plan. You may uncover the tactic you need to get back on track.</p> \n<p>White space can be used to solidify your company's branding strategy. Maybe you're struggling to identify where your product fits in the market. If you find a space for innovation, you can use that to strengthen how your company is seen by others.</p> \n<p>The McDonald's founders didn't have to look far for their opportunities, but things have changed since the 1950s. You might have to dig a little deeper and do some research, but ultimately, your business has something about it that's attractive to customers. Once you find it, you'll be able to keep delighting your clients, growing your company, and changing the industry.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhite-space-opportunity&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f0a7647214e410ba1a26baac62d5132c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhite-space-opportunity&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-27-349_35c715569f93b410.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336426},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"What is a Business Plan?

Securing financing from investors.</h3> \n<p>Since its contents revolve around how businesses succeed, break even, and turn a profit, a business plan is primarily used as a tool for sourcing capital. This document is an entrepreneur's way of showing potential investors and/or loaners how their capital will be put to work and how it will help a business thrive.</p> \n<p>All banks, investors, and venture capital firms will want to see a business plan before handing over their money, and investors typically want <a href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/small-business-investors-percentage-forever-73824.html#:~:text=Angel%20investors%20typically%20want%20from,high%20risk%20it%20is%20taking.\">a 20-25% ROI</a> from the capital they invest in a business.</p> \n<p>Therefore, these investors need to know if – and when – they'll be making their money back (and then some). Additionally, they'll want to read about the process and strategy for <em>how</em> the business will reach those financial goals, which is where the context provided by sales, marketing, and operations plans come into play.</p> \n<h3>2. Documenting a company's strategy and goals.</h3> \n<p>A business plan should leave no stone unturned.</p> \n<p>Business plans can span dozens or even hundreds of pages, affording their drafters the opportunity to explain what a business's goals are and how the business will achieve them.</p> \n<blockquote>\n To show potential investors that they've addressed every question and thought through every possible scenario, entrepreneurs should thoroughly explain their marketing, sales, and operations strategies – from acquiring a physical location for the business to explaining a tactical approach for marketing penetration.\n</blockquote> \n<p>These explanations should ultimately lead to a business's break even point supported by a sales forecast and financial projections, with the business plan writer being able to speak to the why behind anything outlined in the plan.</p> \n<h3>3. Legitimizing a business idea.</h3> \n<p>Everyone's got a great idea for a company – until they put pen to paper and realize that it's not exactly feasible.</p> \n<p>The business plan is an aspiring entrepreneur's way to prove that a business idea is actually worth pursuing.</p> \n<p>As entrepreneurs document their go-to-market process, capital needs, and expected return on investment, entrepreneurs likely come across a few hiccups that will make them second guess their strategies and metrics – and that's exactly what the business plan is for.</p> \n<p>It ensures an entrepreneur's ducks are in a row before bring their business idea to the world and reassures the plan's readers that whoever wrote the plan is serious about the idea, having put hours into thinking of the business idea, fleshing out growth tactics, and calculating financial projections.</p> \n<h3>4. Getting an A in your Business class.</h3> \n<p>Speaking from personal experience, there's a chance you're here to get business plan ideas for your Business 101 class project.</p> \n<p>If that's the case, might we suggest checking out this post on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-plan-template\">How to Write a Business Plan</a> – providing a section-by-section guide on creating your plan?</p> \n<h2><strong>Types of Business Plans</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. Startup Business Plan</h3> \n<p>Arguably the most common type of business plan, a startup business plan is used for brand new business ideas. This plan is used to take a business concept and lay the foundation for its eventual success.</p> \n<p>The biggest challenge with the startup business plan is that it requires its writer to completely start from scratch. Startup business plans start with a blank word document, and before they are finished, need to reference existing industry data and explain unique business strategies and go-to-market plans.</p> \n<h3>2. Business Acquisition Plan</h3> \n<p>Investors will still want to see a business plan to acquire funding to purchase an existing business in order to see how its new owner will run the business.</p> \n<p>What will change and what will stay the same under new ownership, and why? Additionally, the business plan should speak to what the current state of the to-be-acquired business is, and why it's up for sale.</p> \n<p>For example, if someone is purchasing a failing business, the business plan should explain why the business is being purchased and what the new owner will do to turn the business around, referencing previous business metrics, sales projections after the acquisition, and a justification for those projections.</p> \n<h3>3. Business Repositioning Plan</h3> \n<p>When a business wants to save itself, reposition its brand, or try something new, some CEOs or owners will want to develop a business repositioning plan.</p> \n<p>This plan should:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Acknowledge the current state of the company.</li> \n <li>State a vision for the future of the company.</li> \n <li>Explain why the business should (or must) be repositioned.</li> \n <li>Outline a process for how the company will adjust.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Companies planning for a business reposition do so – proactively or retroactively – due to a shift in market trends and customer needs. For example, <a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/pizza-hut-plans-close-hundreds-us-units\">Pizza Hut announced a plan</a> to drastically overhaul its brand last year, as it sees the need to shift from dine-in to delivery – a decision resulting from observing years of industry and company trends and acknowledging the need to reposition itself for the future of its sector.</p> \n<h3>4. Expansion Business Plan</h3> \n<p>Building onto a successful business venture with another location typically requires its own business plan, as the project may require a new location, focus on a new target market, and demand more capital.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, an expansion business plan allows its writers to reference sales, revenue, and successes from any previous location(s). However, as great as a reference as these points can be, it's important to not be <em>too</em> reliant on them, since it's still a new business that could succeed or fail for a myriad of reasons.</p> \n<h2><strong>Getting Started With Your Business Plan</strong></h2> \n<p>At the end of the day, a business plan is simply an explanation of a business idea and why it will be successful. The more detail and thought you put into it, the more successful your plan – and the business it outlines – will be.</p> \n<p>If you need help starting your business plan, download <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template\">Download HubSpot's Free Business Plan Template</a> and fill out the sections to meet your business idea's concept.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-business-plan&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e7740a89a97811b84df5f3e27b6f4e3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"AJ Beltis","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bpt-cover-gif-1.gif?width=443&name=bpt-cover-gif-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn99@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-20-007_0f9f0df1ada75d87.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-business-plan&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-27-753_b4db0abc82431299.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336427},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How to Run a SWOT Analysis for Your Business [Template Included]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/swot-analysis","description":"<p>A SWOT analysis is a useful technique to evaluate a new project or objective your business faces, or your business as a whole.</p>  \n<p>Essentially, a SWOT analysis is a roadmap for how you should move forward with your business, which opportunities you’re missing out on, and which challenges you should tackle.</p> \n<p>It’s an effective method to maximize opportunities while minimizing negative factors associated with a given project or objective. Plus, it lets you unbiasedly evaluate your business’s strengths and weaknesses, which is key to avoiding unnecessary errors down the road from lack of insight.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Here, we’ll provide a SWOT analysis template, and conduct SWOT analyses on major brands Apple and Starbucks. When you’re done reading, you’ll have all the inspiration and tactical advice you need to tackle a SWOT analysis for yourself.</p> \n<p>You know a SWOT analysis is important, but, how do you conduct one?</p> \n<p>There are four steps you’ll want to take when evaluating your business as a whole, or your product in particular. Before you start, you’ll need to figure out what you’re evaluating with your SWOT analysis. Creating a social media program, launching a new product, or considering a brand re-design are all good reasons to conduct a SWOT analysis.</p> \n<h2><strong>Use this SWOT Analysis Template.</strong></h2> \n<p>To visualize your SWOT analysis, it's helpful to make a table. Here, I’ve created a sample using a simple Google Doc table -- feel free to use the model yourself, or create your own as it suits your needs.</p> \n<h3>Make a SWOT Analysis Table</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SWOT%20Analysis%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=SWOT%20Analysis%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg\" alt=\"free editable SWOT Analysis pdf template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagesir\">Download a free, editable SWOT Analysis template.</a></p> \n<p>Use the four steps below as a references when filling in your table.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Identify your strengths.</strong></p> \n<p>Let’s say you want to use a SWOT analysis to evaluate your new social media strategy.</p> \n<p>If you’re looking at a new social media program, perhaps you want to evaluate how your brand is perceived by the public -- is it easily recognizable and well-known? Even if it’s not popular with a widespread group, is it well-received by a specific audience in particular?</p> \n<p>Next, think about your process: is it effective, or innovative? Is there good communication between your marketing and sales to ensure both departments use similar vocabulary when discussing your product?</p> \n<p>Finally, evaluate your social media message, and in particular, how it differs from the rest of the industry. I’m willing to bet you can make a lengthy list of some major strengths of your social media strategy over your competitors, so try to dive into your strengths from there.</p> \n<p><strong>2. Identify your weaknesses.</strong></p> \n<p>If you’re examining a new social media strategy, it’s critical to foresee any potential negative factors that could mitigate your success.</p> \n<p>Start by asking yourself these questions: First, if I were a consumer, what would prevent me from buying this product, or engaging with this business? What would make me click away from the screen?</p> \n<p>Second, what do I foresee as the biggest hinderance to my employees’ productivity, or their ability to get the job done efficiently? What derails their social media efforts?</p> \n<p>When identifying weaknesses, consider what areas of your business are the least profitable, where you lack certain resources, or what costs you the most time and money. Take input from employees in different departments, as they’ll likely see weaknesses you hadn’t considered.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Consider your opportunities.</strong></p> \n<p>This is your chance to dream big. What are some opportunities for your social media strategy you hope, but don’t necessarily expect, to reach?</p> \n<p>For instance, maybe you’re hoping your Facebook ads will attract a new, larger demographic. Maybe you’re hoping your YouTube video gets 10,000 views, and increases sales by 10%.</p> \n<p>Whatever the case, it’s important to include potential opportunities in your SWOT analysis. Ask yourself these questions: What technologies do I want my business to use to make it more effective? What new target audience do I want to reach? How can the business stand out more in the current industry? Is there something our customers complain about that we could fix with our social media strategy?</p> \n<p>The opportunities category goes hand-in-hand with the weaknesses category. Once you’ve made a list of weaknesses, it should be easy to create a list of potential opportunities that could arise if you eliminate your weaknesses.</p> \n<p><strong>4. Contemplate your threats. </strong></p> \n<p>It’s likely, especially if you’re prone to worrying, you already have a good list of threats in your head.</p> \n<p>If not, gather your employees and brainstorm: what obstacles might prevent us from reaching our social media goals? What’s going on in the industry, or with our competitors, that might mitigate our success? Is there new technology out there that could conflict with our product?</p> \n<p>Writing down your threats helps you evaluate them objectively. For instance, maybe you list your threats in terms of least and most likely to occur, and divide and conquer each. If one of your biggest threats is your competitor’s popular Instagram account, you could work with your marketing department to create content that showcases your product’s unique features.</p> \n<h2><strong>SWOT Analysis Examples</strong></h2> \n<p>The template above helps get you started on your own SWOT analysis.</p> \n<p>But, if you’re anything like me, it’s not enough to see a template. To fully understand a concept, you need to see how it plays out in the real world.</p> \n<p>Here are two examples of SWOT analyses on major corporations, Apple and Starbucks. The list of strengths and weaknesses is not exhaustive, and I’m sure you could add some yourself, but hopefully, it’s enough to inspire your own SWOT analysis.</p> \n<h3>Apple’s SWOT analysis</h3> \n<p>Here’s how we’d conduct a SWOT analysis on Apple.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.11.17%20AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.11.17%20AM.png\" alt=\"SWOT analysis showing Apple's Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">First off, strengths. While Apple has many strengths, let’s identify the top three:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Brand recognition</li> \n <li>High prices</li> \n <li>Innovative products</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Apple’s brand is undeniably valuable, and was named the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/05/23/apple-heads-the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-of-2017-at-170-billion/#192b9e3f384b\">world’s most valuable brand</a> by Forbes. Since it’s easily recognized, Apple can produce new products and almost ensure a certain degree of success by virtue of the brand name itself.</p> \n<p>This degree of recognition lends itself to Apple’s ability to sell products at extremely high prices. For instance, in 2016, Apple <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/05/23/apple-heads-the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-of-2017-at-170-billion/#192b9e3f384b\">sold 78 million iPhones, the average cost of which was $695</a>. In comparison, Samsung sold their smartphones for $500 less. And yet, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/05/23/apple-heads-the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-of-2017-at-170-billion/#7ca54732384b\">92% of the profits in the smartphone category</a> for 2016 went to Apple. Often, people don’t care about price as much as they care about brand recognition.</p> \n<p>Lastly, their innovative products: Apple didn’t earn its reputation for nothing. They create highly innovative products, which are often at the forefront of the industry.</p> \n<p>Next, let’s look at three of Apple’s weaknesses.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>High prices</li> \n <li>Closed ecosystem</li> \n <li>Lack of experimentation</li> \n</ol> \n<p>While the high prices don’t deter Apple’s middle and high class customer-base, they do hinder Apple’s ability to reach a lower-class demographic.</p> \n<p>Apple also suffers from its own exclusivity. Apple controls all its services and products in-house, and while many customers become loyal brand advocates for this reason, it means all burdens fall on Apple employees.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Apple’s tight control over who distributes their products limit their market reach.</p> \n<p>Lastly, Apple is held to a high standard when it comes to creating and distributing products. Apple’s brand carries a high level of prestige, but that level of recognition inhibits Apple from taking risks and experimenting freely with new products that could fail.</p> \n<p>Now, let’s take a look at opportunities for Apple.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to recognize opportunities for improvement, once you consider Apple’s weaknesses. Here’s a list of three we came up with:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Expand distribution options</li> \n <li>Create new product lines</li> \n <li>Technological advancement</li> \n</ol> \n<p>One of Apple’s biggest weaknesses is its distribution network, which, in the name of exclusivity, remains relatively small. If Apple expanded its network and enabled third-party businesses to sell its products, it could reach more people globally, while alleviating some of the stress currently put on in-house employees.</p> \n<p>There are also plenty of opportunities for Apple to create new products. Apple could consider creating more affordable products to reach a larger demographic, or spreading out into new industries -- Apple self-driving cars, perhaps?</p> \n<p>Finally, Apple could continue advancing its products’ technology. Apple can take existing products and refine them, ensuring each product offers as many unique features as possible.</p> \n<p>Finally, let’s look at threats to Apple.</p> \n<p>Believe it or not, they do exist.</p> \n<p>Here are three of Apple’s biggest threats:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Tough competition</li> \n <li>Lawsuits</li> \n <li>International issues</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Apple isn’t the only innovative tech company out there, and it continues to face tough competition from Samsung, Google, and other major forces. Many of Apple’s weaknesses hinder Apple’s ability to compete with the tech corporations that have more freedom to experiment, or that don’t operate in a closed ecosystem.</p> \n<p>A second threat to Apple is lawsuits. Over the last few years, Apple has faced a bunch of lawsuits, particularly between <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/23/16519546/apple-samsung-patent-lawsuit-damages-retrial-october\">Apple and Samsung</a>, and so far it has only <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/6/16614038/apple-samsung-slide-to-unlock-supreme-court-120-million\">won one case</a>. These lawsuits interfere with Apple’s reputable image, and could steer some customers to purchasing elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Finally, Apple needs to improve its reach internationally. It isn’t <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/in-china-the-iphone-is-only-second-best-830776/\">number one in China</a>, and doesn’t have a very positive relationship with the Chinese government. Then, in India, which has one of the largest consumer markets in the world, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/29/why-apple-sells-just-2-point-5-percent-of-indias-smartphones.html\">Apple’s market share is low</a>, and the company has trouble bringing stores to India’s market.</p> \n<p>If Apple can’t compete globally the way Samsung or Google can, it risks falling behind in the industry.</p> \n<h3>Starbucks SWOT Analysis</h3> \n<p>Now that we’ve explored the nuances involved with a SWOT analysis, let’s fill out a SWOT template using Starbucks as an example.</p> \n<p>Here’s how we’d fill out a SWOT template, if we were Starbucks:</p> \n<div>\n <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/starbucksswotanalysis.png\" alt=\"Starbucks SWOT Analysis example\"></a>\n</div> \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download this Template for Free</span></a>\n</div> \n<h3>Dine-In Thai Restaurant SWOT Analysis</h3> \n<p>Some small-business marketers may have difficulty relating to the SWOT's of big brands like Apple and Starbucks, so here's an example of how a restaurant might visualize each element:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.26.00%20AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.26.00%20AM.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Dine-in Thai Restaurant SWOT analysis example\">While a Thai or any other restaurant might not be as worried about high-level lawsuits like Apple, the small business might be more worried about competitors or disruptors that might enter the playing field.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Local Boutique SWOT Analysis</h3> \n<p>In another small-business example, a local boutique might be well known in its neighborhood, but it also might take time to build an online presence or get its products in an online store. Because of this, some of its strengths and opportunities might relate to physical factors while weaknesses and threats might relate to online situations.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.24.40%20AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.24.40%20AM.png\" alt=\"Local boutique SWOT analysis example\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h2>When to Use a SWOT Analysis</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, a SWOT analysis can measure and tackle both big and small challenges, and opportunities, and both big and little strengths and weaknesses.</p> \n<p>While the examples above focus on businesses in general, you can also use a SWOT analysis to evaluate and predict how a singular product will play out in the market.</p> \n<p>Hopefully, our SWOT template will supplement your market research and business analysis, and provide fair insights into how to optimize your products for bigger payoffs, and less hurdles.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May, 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fswot-analysis&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 19:05:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9f22ef1f9504cd42dddbf2da0dba5e4b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SWOT%20Analysis%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&name=SWOT%20Analysis%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn9@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-26-884_28f7ed392ffa061e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.11.17%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.11.17%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn78@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-28-382_d17ce5537f683cfa.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/starbucksswotanalysis.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn74@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-27-634_a268c0f05cb65a0a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.26.00%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.26.00%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-22-195_e725d410d9523fc7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.24.40%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-22%20at%2010.24.40%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-21-243_8e5e600abafa5af5.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fswot-analysis&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn65@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-23-941_fb1068d473508007.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336434},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"15 Essential Social Media Marketing Tips From Beginner to Advanced","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-backed-social-media-marketing-tips","description":"<p>One of the most humbling experiences as a marketer is putting out that tweet you just <em>knew</em> would be a home run for your audience.</p>  \n<p>We’d like to think of ourselves as being able to come up with A+ <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/resources/courses/social-media\">social media</a> content every day, but the reality is that we're all human.

Republish and update older posts.</h3> \n<p>If you have a backlog of content that's outdated, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guide-to-updating-republishing-blogging-content-ht\">update and republish it</a> with fresh ideas for SEO. This tactic has the potential to draw in new readers and take less time than continuously pumping out new ideas.</p> \n<p>This can be blog posts, landing pages, and offers that you have on your website. Your social media strategy exists to put your best foot forward by building engagement, and you don't have to start from ground zero.</p> \n<p>In fact, this exact post is an update from 2017, originally posted in 2013. We regularly update posts to ensure our readers are getting fresh content on our blog, social channels, and emails.</p> \n<h3>3. Schedule posts for evenings.</h3> \n<p>Don’t be afraid of weekends either. Scheduling content launches for evenings opens up a door for engagement that isn't cut off by time zone. That way, even if it's 3 AM in your geographic location, your tweet about your new app update reaches audiences around the world.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspotlife/?hl=en\">HubSpot Life</a> is a behind-the-scenes look at HubSpot's culture, posting content from global offices on social media. During what's considered \"off\" hours in the US, HubSpot Life features posts during work hours in other countries, like Paris, Bogota, or Dublin.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-11%20at%2010.25.49%20AM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-08-11%20at%2010.25.49%20AM.png\" alt=\"hubspot life instagram\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspotlife/?hl=en\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>This ensures that global audiences are able to get fresh content during their work days, as well.</p> \n<p>When scheduling posts for evenings, avoid content that requires engagement from your team. For instance, an Instagram photo that invites followers to <i> \"Comment below!\"</i> about something might not be the best idea to post at midnight, when you're not able to engage.</p> \n<h3>4. Include hashtags to increase engagement</h3> \n<p>Hashtags are like a golden ticket to increasing your online reach. Common tags like #SocialMedia and #MarketingGoals are great, but try searching for less-used ones like those of bigger brands (such as Adobe's #CreateYourStory), or community-based (#BrightonMA). Those are going to be the ones an active audience is checking out.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Buffer-on-Instagram-bio-example.png?width=1500&amp;name=Buffer-on-Instagram-bio-example.png\" alt=\"buffer on instagram hashtags\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/brandviews/buffer/the-science-behind-the-best-instagram-bios-02246266\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>As well as using existing hashtags, try your hand at creating your own branded hashtags, like <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\"> Buffer</a> did in the example above (#BufferLove). This allows you to track what your followers and customers are saying about your media presence and product.</p> \n<h3>5. Use visuals whenever possible.</h3> \n<p>If you're getting your feet wet with the social media game, it's okay not to invest a fortune into visual content. However, it's always a good idea to include pictures, videos, or graphics in posts whenever you can.</p> \n<p>There are a number of free services, like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\"> Canva</a> , to help you edit and create content. <a href=\"https://giphy.com/\"> GIFs</a> are a great way to engage with a younger audience. And never forget the smartphone most likely in your pocket they produce beautiful pictures you can definitely use on socials.</p> \n<p>If you've tried your hand at social media before and feel comfortable branching out, these intermediate tips are for you. They're aimed at easing the process of creating uniform content across your channels while increasing clicks.</p> \n<h3>1. Post multiple times a day.</h3> \n<p>You don't need to post every hour, but one to three times a day keeps your brand fresh in your audience's mind. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-user-generated-content-campaigns\">Reposting user-generated content</a> also counts, so don’t stress about coming up with dozens of new content ideas.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/guide-user-generated-content-ecommerce\"><em>Download this free guide to learn how to leverage user-generated content to improve your conversion rates.</em></a></p> \n<p>If you’re looking for ways to brush up your content marketing, how about incorporating an infographic or eBook into that Facebook post?

Incorporate your brand into your social strategy.</h3> \n<p>Your brand should speak for you. Once you've established your brand, think of ways to blend it into your social media marketing. This can mean adding your logo to posts, including a company hashtag, or highlighting your employees.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/metter%20media%20branding.png?width=1500&amp;name=metter%20media%20branding.png\" alt=\"Metter Media branding example\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 1500px;\" width=\"1500\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mettermedia/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Check out this branding from social media management company, Metter Media. From a quick scroll through their Instagram homepage, you can quickly spot company colors, get a look into their team, and gain an idea of who they represent.</p> \n<h3>3. Engage audiences with interactive content.</h3> \n<p>From Twitter polls to Instagram Q&amp;As, there are many ways to engage your audience and make your company’s content diverse. You can use interactive content to educate your audience about your products or to connect with your audience.</p> \n<p>Think of ways your audience engages with competitors and how you can add your company into the mix. You can even ask your audience what type of content they prefer to see on an Instagram story, like this example below:</p> \n<div> \n <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/polling%20screenshot-1.png?width=359&amp;name=polling%20screenshot-1.png\" style=\"width: 359px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Instagram poll example\" width=\"359\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com/frommybowl\"></a></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com/frommybowl\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n</div> \n<p>The story of this food blogger begins to recap previous recipes with links to corresponding blog posts. To put this in a B2B perspective, say you wanted to boost clicks on previous blog content. You could poll followers, <i> \"Which type of post goes best with your coffee?\" </i> and link to two options in the next parts of your story.</p> \n<h3>4. Invest in more visual content.</h3> \n<p>As you get into the swing of posting on social media, invest more time into visual content. On average, retweets with pictures gain more clicks and views than text-only posts.</p> \n<p>Visual content isn't just restricted to Instagram. Post infographics about your industry on LinkedIn, tweet a funny meme relating to your office culture, or post a video on Facebook taking viewers on a high-speed tour of your office.</p> \n<p>Next up are some advanced tips. These ideas are for social media pros in need of a new direction or options to brighten their feeds.</p> \n<h3>1. Use new app updates to your advantage.</h3> \n<p>Have you tried <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-tiktok\"> TikTok</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/igtv\">IGTV</a> yet? If not, we suggest expanding your strategy to include these channels. After all, you don’t want to miss out on your content having the potential to meet <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-hit-1-billion-downloads-surpassing-instagram-in-2018-2019-2\">one billion</a> phones.</p> \n<p>New apps and app updates add to the ability to diversify your brand and keep things fresh. If you're looking to show your company's humorous side, try uploading a little <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-tiktok?_ga=2.157622713.2000696366.1572268289-940436819.1565181751\"> dance</a> video on TikTok. If you want to bring that podcast of yours to visual audiences, upload it to IGTV.</p> \n<div>\n <iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto display: block display: block; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6720653674525363461\" width=\"340\" height=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div> \n<h3>2. Invest in influencers to promote your product or service.</h3> \n<p>It's official: young audiences listen to their idols. <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/youtube-stars-influence/\"> Four in 10</a> millennials trust the products their favorite influencers promote on their social channels, so <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\">investing in influencers</a> might be an avenue to look into when trying to generate sales.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/influencer-marketing-guide\"><em>Download our free ultimate guide to getting started with influencer marketing.</em></a></p> \n<p>If you have an audience that's younger, research influencers in your industry and pitch potential partnerships. Or, for a more budget-friendly option, look at how influencers are branding their content — you may be able to incorporate some ideas into your strategy.</p> \n<h3>3. Diversify content on every social media platform.</h3> \n<p>You can update and sync content on your accounts like a pro. Now it's time to make that content unique. Save your high-definition videos for Facebook and meme posts for Twitter.</p> \n<p>When diversifying content, make sure they all relate back to your company's goals and mission. There's no need to post a recipe for falafel on your marketing company's Instagram, but an infographic displaying the 'recipe' for a perfect caption would be a compelling, spot on example.</p> \n<div> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p>If you're a writer, a filmmaker, or really anyone who’s looking for good career advice, check out this thread from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrismcquarrie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@chrismcquarrie</a>. 🙌 <a href=\"https://t.co/RRCbxoO8kg\">https://t.co/RRCbxoO8kg</a></p> — LinkedIn (@LinkedIn) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1187391628916510720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</div>   \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/linkedin%20diversifying%20content%20example.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"LinkedIn Facebook post\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://facebook.com/linkedin\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>On October 24th, LinkedIn highlighted a blog post on Facebook. On the same day, LinkedIn promoted a Twitter thread aimed at aspiring filmmakers. Threads are a Twitter-specific tool aimed at sectioning off long thoughts, while the Facebook post gives LinkedIn more clicks from their Facebook followers.</p> \n<h3>4. Start promotions to build audience growth.</h3> \n<p>Have you run a contest on your Twitter account yet? Totino's does them well.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/totinos%20promotion.png?width=1500&amp;name=totinos%20promotion.png\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Totinos promotion tweet example\" width=\"1500\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/totinos\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Don't worry, promotions don't have to be this fancy. Running a promotion can be simple as giving 10% off of your product or service to a lucky winner who retweets. This expands your reach and sparks lead generation among your customers' followers.</p> \n<h3>5. Create timely content that resonates with audiences.</h3> \n<p>As a huge believer in taking advantage in the meme of the moment, creating timely content adds some fun to your channels and can explain the uses of your product in a new way. Memes aren't the only way to accomplish this, seasons are, as well.</p> \n<p>Is it wintertime in your part of the world? Celebrate by snapping a pic of your company's favorite snowy activity and share it to Facebook. Alternatively, #NationalSandwichDay is November 3rd. Popeye's used this holiday to announce the comeback of a recent fan favorite.</p> \n<div> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p>Y’all…the sandwich is back Sunday, November 3rd.

The pressure is on nowadays when it seems like the trends are changing every second, and diving in can seem like jumping down a rabbit hole.</p> \n<p>These tips will keep you current on ways to organize your page, upgrade your content, and grow your target audience, but don't stop here.

With these previews, ecommerce visitors can see an item of clothing on a photo of their body, preview what furniture will look like in their bedroom, and even size themselves to ensure they're buying a product with the best fit.</p> \n<p>But is this virtual experience really as effective as a traditional store or fitting room at getting people to buy?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Skeptics might say no. With AR being costly to implement and product viewings only requiring a physical store location, many marketers think that this technology isn't worth the fuss.</p> \n<p>However, as the world grows more and more digital, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">each new generation</a> is making even more online purchases. They're also embracing technologies <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emerging-technology-stats\">like AR/VR for entertainment or retail purposes</a>.</p> \n<p>Not to mention, while holidays like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/black-friday-ads\">Black Friday</a> cause a burst in foot-traffic, retail businesses are finding it more challenging to keep people coming into stores throughout the rest of the year.</p> \n<p>While AR might have been inaccessible to retail marketers in the past, could it be a revenue-generating opportunity at some point in the near future?</p> \n<p>To determine if augmented reality was actually a beneficial marketing technology, I asked 300 consumers about their experiences with AR product previews using Lucid survey software.</p> \n<p>In the survey, consumers were asked, \"Have you ever purchased a product (such as furniture or clothing) after seeing an augmented-reality preview of what it would look like in real life?\"</p> \n<p>Since the technology is still rather new, you might expect consumers to say they've never used an AR product preview. However, you might also be wondering if those who've used an AR product preview actually converted.</p> \n<p>If you think that the general population hasn't used this new retail technology, you might be surprised by the result below.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Do%20AR%20Product%20Previews%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Research%5D.png?width=600&amp;name=Do%20AR%20Product%20Previews%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Research%5D.png\" alt=\"have you purchased something after using an AR preview\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><em>Data Source: </em><a href=\"https://luc.id/\">Lucid</a></p> \n<p>According to the survey, 52% of consumers have purchased at least one item after seeing an AR preview of how it would look in real life. Over 30% of that group have purchased multiple products after previewing them with AR.</p> \n<p>So, what does this mean for small or medium-sized retailers?</p> \n<p>Understandably, you might not be able to afford AR technology to highlight your products just yet. However, the fact that more brands are using this feature to influence purchasing decisions means that technology and personalized digital marketing tactics like AR previews will likely become more prominent.</p> \n<p>Just because you can't afford AR now, doesn't mean you'll be unable to leverage it in the future. As augmented reality grows more prominent and more valuable to businesses, AR ecommerce tools might become more accessible or competitively priced. This is a theme we've seen with the influence of artificial intelligence.</p> \n<p>While the technology was pricey and inaccessible to small-to-medium businesses at first, there are now a number of affordable out-of-the-box tools that marketers and businesses can leverage.</p> \n<p>Even if you can't take advantage of the latest marketing technology today, it's still important to keep up with how other retailers are using it -- especially if they're selling products in a similar category as you.</p> \n<p>Below, I'll walk you through a few AR strategies that effectively benefit retailers now, or could be a vital product marketing tactic in the future:</p> \n<h2>3 AR Product Marketing Strategies to Watch in 2020</h2> \n<h3>Mobile Previews on Ecommerce Sites</h3> \n<p>With this strategy, a mobile ecommerce website visitor can find a product they're interested in, open a camera when tapping an AR preview button, and then view how the product -- such as furniture -- will look in the room they're in. Some ecommerce platforms also allow prospects to see what an accessory such as glasses, will look on their face. If a customer likes what they see in an AR preview, they can exit the preview and make a purchase without setting foot in a store.</p> \n<p>With increasing mobile ecommerce, this strategy allows visitors to discover a product through mobile search or an app, visit an ecommerce site, get an idea of what it looks like in real life, and then smoothly purchase it wherever they are. It also eliminates key friction points that could halt a purchase such as going to the store or not finding a product in the right size or color in a physical retail location.</p> \n<p>At the moment, we're already seeing corporations like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/augmented-reality-examples\">IKEA, Home Depot, and Amazon</a> embrace AR product previews on mobile sites and apps. But, this strategy might not be totally inaccessible to smaller businesses.</p> \n<p>For example, a <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-ar\">small bicycle retailer called PureCycles</a> wanted to improve its website's mobile experience and conversions. With a large catalog of bicycle product shots taken from multiple angles, they created AR previews with Shopify.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_jkw04GgXY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>PureCycles says its use of virtual previews <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-ar\">improved the customer experience on mobile-optimized browsers</a> and allowed customers to answer key questions about their products, such as \"Will this bicycle fit in my small apartment?\"</p> \n<h3>Virtual Mirrors</h3> \n<p>Ever seen a shirt you loved in a clothing store but couldn't find it in your size? Or, have you ever wanted to test out expensive makeup before buying it? These are two business cases that could call for AR mirrors, often called \"virtual\" or \"magic\" mirrors.</p> \n<p>With AR mirror technology, you can stand in front of a screen in selfie mode, and see an overlay of how products in the store's catalog will look on you in the right size or shade.</p> \n<p>After your virtual experience, some virtual mirrors will allow you to order the product or send yourself a link for it so you can order it later. This prevents any additional friction related to having to wait until the item comes back in stock.</p> \n<p>This virtual process also allows you to see products that the store sells but might not sell in the store due to seasonality or space-related limitations.</p> \n<p>This strategy is used by Charlotte Tilbury, a UK-based beauty retailer.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/188396641?app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Virtual mirrors, purchased and installed by <a href=\"https://holition.com/\">Holition</a>, line the boutique's walls. When a customer looks into one, the camera and software scan the measurements and skin tone of their face. From there, the customer taps different makeup items on the screen to see how the products will look on their face. Here's a quick video demonstration of how the software works:</p> \n<h3>Social Media Filters</h3> \n<p>Have you ever launched Instagram or Facebook Stories and noticed new AR filters that allowed you to test out products directly through your app? If not, you'll definitely see more of this soon.</p> \n<p>Recognizing the low-hanging fruit of AR previews in ecommerce, <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/facebook-fidji-simo-diane-von-furstenberg-fashion-advertising\">Facebook and Instagram</a>, are actively taking steps to provide more commerce that leverage this technology. For example, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-experiments-with-augmented-reality-advertising-2019-12\">in late 2019</a>, Facebook made AR filter ads available in Facebook Ads. These ads allow users to test out products in Facebook Stories and its News Feed.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of what one of these ads might look like:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Do%20AR%20Product%20Previews%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-2.png?width=557&amp;name=Do%20AR%20Product%20Previews%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-2.png\" alt=\"AR social media product filters\" width=\"557\" style=\"width: 557px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-experiments-with-augmented-reality-advertising-2019-12\" style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Leveraging product-centric AR filters on social media provides the perks of the mobile AR previews without relying on shoppers to actually visit an ecommerce site.</p> \n<p>As social media users tap through their friend's Stories or content, they might notice a Story with an AR product in it or discover and AR preview that they can experience. These types of experiences are much more natural than seeing an influencer posting about a dress or makeup item, visiting the ecommerce site, and then doing added research to see if it's the right shade.</p> \n<p>While social AR previews are still in early phases, platforms <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/facebook-fidji-simo-diane-von-furstenberg-fashion-advertising\">like Facebook</a> are already identifying types of retailers that could thrive with these tools. For example, AR features that allow users to preview products via social media could be a game-changer in the world of fashion and beauty. In 2018, this industry already saw a <a href=\"https://www.brandtotal.com/\">164% social media revenue increase</a> from paid promotions.</p> \n<p>With social media users actively engaging with paid beauty ads, brands that are able to leverage AR on Facebook and Instagram would be able to reach social-media-friendly audiences on popular platforms and allow them to try new products.</p> \n<p>One company that's already leveraging AR to highlight products on social media is Dior, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/a/r/?effect_id=510300079757378&amp;ch=ZGE4ZTRiZmRiZTFkZWIzZDRlNjA4YmE1M2EzMDAzMDc=\">which allows users to try looks</a> from its Fall/Winter fashion line on their Instagram Stories camera.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Do%20AR%20Product%20Previews%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-1.png?width=600&amp;name=Do%20AR%20Product%20Previews%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Research%5D-1.png\" alt=\"product try on AR filters\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thezoereport.com/p/diors-new-instagram-filter-lets-you-virtually-try-on-accessories-from-the-fallwinter-2019-runway-19267316\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>As social media and mobile surfing continue to dominate how <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">millennials and Gen Z spend their time</a>, the need to invest in clever mobile advertising, such as AR ads, will also grow. .Although the combination of AR tactics and social media is still new -- and not worth blowing your budget on just yet -- you should still continue to follow brands and competitors that leverage it in case this technology becomes more accessible in the future.</p> \n<h2>What AR Success Means for Retailers</h2> \n<p>While the growth of AR shows how businesses are using new technology to benefit the customer journey, the effectiveness of AR and other retail technologies shows that customers are increasingly looking for digital, personalized, and frictionless shopping experiences.</p> \n<p>And this makes sense. More and more, people are using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">mobile ecommerce stores and online social platforms</a> to find, vet, and ultimately purchase products.</p> \n<p>Even if you do have a physical store, you'll need to embrace highly digital tactics to ensure that you're gaining brand awareness from people online along with people in your neighborhood.</p> \n<p>And while you shouldn't spend all of your money investing in AR, there are other tactics you can take on to inform your audience about your products or services. These include highlighting <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-product-research\">your products on social media</a>, launching a small but scalable <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ecommerce-marketing\">ecommerce store</a>, or sending customers <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-personalization-examples\">personalized emails</a> about products they might like based on what they've already purchased from your store.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Far-product-preview-data&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important;

To stay healthy, people aren't walking into stores and restaurants to make purchases anymore. Instead, they're typically making those transactions online.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the convenience of having items delivered to one's home has changed the shopping experience for consumers. People will likely continue to prefer ecommerce even after the global crisis is over.</p> \n<p>The same goes for pick-ups — although it requires the customer to leave their home and take precautions, the process has become streamlined and requires little interaction. Ultimately, retailers will need to note these conveniences and how effectively they have drawn customers. This is a model that will need to be implemented post-crisis.</p> \n<p>To shift to an ecommerce model, companies need to first research <a href=\"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/\">competitive shipping prices</a> to get the best deals. Customers want more items shipped, and prohibitive shipping costs might be a deal-breaker for some of your customers.</p> \n<p>The existence of a shipping option also means investing in packaging, which means custom branded boxes and packages will become a mainstay for stores. Brands will also need to be aware of the price and quality of their packaging — they will be expected to invest in <a href=\"https://packhelp.com/sustainable-packaging/\">sustainable packaging</a> to make for a safer future.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, shipping and delivery is a major component of ecommerce and can incentivize customers to become long-term advocates of your brand if implemented successfully.</p> \n<h3>2. More Health and Safety Measures</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.worksafebc.com/en/about-us/covid-19-updates/covid-19-returning-safe-operation/retail\" style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The world has been looking forward to life after COVID-19, but the reality is that we will be adjusting to life <em>with </em>it.</p> \n<p>The hygiene practices initiated during the lockdown procedures will need to be maintained, especially as more retailers open up.</p> \n<p>Companies need to scout out strategic locations around their stores to add sanitizers. More cleaning crews will need to be brought in regularly to disinfect the premises.</p> \n<p>Social distancing measures may have been relaxed in certain parts of the world, but there will be occasional flare-ups. Retailers should prepare to reduce the number of people allowed within their building sites — which could mean a fluctuation in sales and revenue.</p> \n<p>As we have mentioned, curbside pickups and home deliveries will become the norm, but brands need to ensure that these items are handled with care.</p> \n<p>Current staff members are likely already trained on safety measures, but any new members will need to be on-boarded accordingly. Additionally, businesses will need to work to keep their employees safe within the premises.</p> \n<p>The world has changed and we will be feeling the effects for a while after — preparing for a safer working environment can only benefit a business in the long-run.</p> \n<h3>3. Remote Work</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/306695/workers-discovering-affinity-remote-work.aspx\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Retailers may not be directly impacted by remote work, but their customers will be — and this needs to be factored in when designing the project plan for shifting into ecommerce.</p> \n<p>While stores need their in-store staff to function, a large majority of their customers will <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tips\">continue to work from home</a> for the rest of 2020 and beyond.</p> \n<p>Many companies are also considering making a portion of their staff permanently remote, which will impact how they access retail services like food, clothes, and entertainment.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Diminished Brand Awareness</h3> \n<p>The quarantine period put paid to all theories about brand awareness and loyalty.</p> \n<p>Consumers were so desperate for products that they bought them from whichever brand was available — despite being patrons of other companies for years before.</p> \n<p>And this trend may well continue — the 'get whatever you can' mindset has set in quickly and will be difficult to shake, and the impact on brand awareness will be felt for long after.</p> \n<p>Since the world has had months of needing specific items and grabbing at whatever was available, consumers will find that supporting a single brand isn't always a valuable position for them.</p> \n<p>With so many consumers dipping into multiple brands, retailers will have to work twice as hard to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">spread awareness about their business</a>.</p> \n<p>Companies would do well to adapt their brand awareness activities to highlight their ecommerce efforts — such as more online shopping options, delivery, and pickup services.</p> \n<p>Creating messaging that boosts the business' ecommerce aspects and opportunities will go a long way in attracting audiences, as it is relevant and timely.</p> \n<p>Regular updates about health and safety measures will also reassure customers enough to give them an incentive to visit stores.</p> \n<p>Retailers need to accept that competition will be more fraught than before — keep an eye on the gaps that appear in the market and use those as, and when, they appear.</p> \n<p>Consumers have an abundance of choices — narrow down their focus by highlighting the added value you can give them in your ecommerce communication plans.</p> \n<h3>5. Virtual Experiences</h3> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pNibZOzslU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>With remote work becoming more of a norm across the world, retailers will have to find new ways to create memorable experiences and relationships with customers.</p> \n<p>Since consumers won't be visiting stores as often as they used to pre-pandemic, businesses need to look to online sources to create those experiences.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675437303/how-to-get-more-likes-on-instagram\">Social media has become a lifeline</a> for most consumers and this is something that businesses can use to promote their products and services.</p> \n<p>Several companies successfully kept their audiences engaged by hosting live streams on YouTube or Instagram Stories of classes, product demos, and expert interviews.</p> \n<p>The need to remain socially distanced and safe has led to retailers creating online versions of their in-house experiences, such as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/augmented-reality-retail\">virtual dressing rooms and fittings</a>.</p> \n<p>Businesses can also create AR filters on Instagram and Snapchat for consumers to try on products like makeup and clothes, as well as for gamification.</p> \n<p>The more online a business can be in the future, the better they will be able to engage with their customers.</p> \n<h3>6. Offer Discounts and Gift Cards</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis-3.png?width=456&amp;name=The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis-3.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 456px;\" width=\"456\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://saveourfaves.org/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The pandemic has hit a large contingent of consumers very hard — and this hardship is set to continue.</p> \n<p>Spending ability and disposable income will decrease as a result, which means businesses will have to work twice as hard to incentivize customers to purchase from them.</p> \n<p>Brands should look at a more cohesive <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-centric\">customer-centric approach</a> to their marketing — giving customers a reason to consistently engage with the brand.</p> \n<p>To mitigate reduced consumer spending, retail brands should offer more discounts, package deals, and special offers.</p> \n<p>Employ incentives to encourage customers to use your ecommerce services — it will act as an advertisement for your virtual platforms, which users are more interested in now.</p> \n<p>Discounts can also help in amplifying sales of underperforming product categories — they look more lucrative with a smaller price tag and will sell better, reducing inventory.</p> \n<p>Gift cards are a great way to assure future business while bringing in immediate revenue.</p> \n<h3>7. Review Supplier Orders</h3> \n<p>There is still so much uncertainty around which items will move quickly that having excess inventory as a restaurant or a retailer could lead to revenue losses in 2020.</p> \n<p>Retailers should be identifying overstocked items in their warehouses. You'll want to determine which items aren't selling well, and order fewer of those.</p> \n<p>Of course, it's important not to be out of stock of popular items, as that will impact sales — there is a delicate balance that has to be reached here.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inventory-management\">inventory management system</a> will help to track items in stock and determine which ones are selling out faster than others.</p> \n<p>To ensure inventories aren't full, retailers should work with their suppliers to slow down the production of certain items — if ecommerce sales pick up, production can be increased.</p> \n<p>Also, you'll want to look into setting up longer payment delivery methods for suppliers — this will help companies retain capital and keep the business afloat until more sales are made.</p> \n<h3>8. Loyalty Marketing</h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Move%20to%20Ecommerce%20How%20Retailers%20Can%20Adapt%20During%20a%20Crisis-2.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www2.hm.com/en_us/member/info.html\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Image Source</span></em></a></p> \n<p>Repeat customers make up the bulk of revenue and profits for most businesses — building a loyal community of customers is thus a priority, especially during such uncertain times.</p> \n<p>Focusing the business' efforts on loyalty marketing will make a difference to the bottom line and should be included in your ecommerce project plan.</p> \n<p>For the rest of 2020, brands will need to work on getting more loyal customers — incentives like discounts have been known to work in this area.</p> \n<p>But to create genuine brand loyalty, a few discounts here and there won't make a huge impact.</p> \n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://appinstitute.com/customer-loyalty-programs/\">customer loyalty programs</a> can be a huge draw. A points system that rewards customers for buying improves engagement and repeat sales.</p> \n<p>Another way to improve consumer loyalty is through subscription services.</p> \n<p>Ecommerce subscriptions have been the basis of many successful business models, in a variety of fields, and they can help businesses boost customer loyalty.</p> \n<p>Subscriptions and loyalty programs give brands a database of people to regularly contact to improve sales — for companies that haven't instituted these, 2020 will be the best time to do so.</p> \n<p>The pandemic is changing the way businesses function, but ecommerce is quickly proving to be a safe model of work that companies can adopt.</p> \n<p>Since ecommerce isn't an arena that all companies are familiar with, to prepare for the shift, here are the steps businesses should include in their project scope:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Investing in pickup and delivery services</li> \n <li>Instituting more health and safety measures</li> \n <li>Acknowledging customers' remote working needs</li> \n <li>Adjusting for diminished brand awareness</li> \n <li>Creating more virtual experiences</li> \n <li>Offering discounts and gift cards</li> \n <li>Reviewing supplier orders and inventory management</li> \n <li>Focusing on loyalty marketing and subscription services</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Following these eight steps will help businesses move safely into an ecommerce environment to improve their sales in the future.

Companies with social media pages generally have a theme that relates to the organization. The use of colors, sensory details, and styling all contribute to the overall theme of a page. I, for one, <em>love </em>thematic Instagrams — they're so aesthetically pleasing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When the colors, text, and photos all fit, I find myself going through all the content because it's so easy to look at — the same is true for Stories.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, I come across posts that make me think, \"How did this marketer turn a simple content idea into this engaging Instagram Story?\" And, as always, curiosity got the best of me. I had a question, and I was ready to search for the answer.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, I knew exactly who to look to for help. I wanted to know just how social media marketers choose the right pieces to include in Stories, so I turned to the experts. I asked HubSpot's marketers this question and compiled their tips.</p> \n<p>Let's see what they had to say.</p> \n<h3>1. Look for buzzy, trendy content.</h3> \n<p>When choosing content to add to Instagram Stories, HubSpot Audience Growth Writer Pam Bump, asks herself a question: “<em>Is the content buzz-worthy?</em>”</p> \n<p>\"Trend or buzz-worthy content usually relates to a topic, trend, or piece of research that people in my industry are talking about or sharing on social media,\" she says. \"If a topic is already being widely discussed and shared, it might be more engaging as a story on a social platform.\"</p> \n<p>For instance, if you find that a hot topic in your industry is, say, personality tests, and you have a blog post all about them, think about how you can adapt that into a story.</p> \n<p>Check out this example from HubSpot:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-3.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-3.png\" alt=\"Example of content broken up in a story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This story corresponds with a post about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personality-tests\">free personality tests</a>. It takes the main ideas from the article and uses short, digestible sentences to recap the content. Additionally, the story's following tiles included a few of the options outlined in the blog:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-4.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-4.png\" alt=\"Example of reforming content into an Instagram story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>This tile includes a \"<a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-swipe-up/\">Swipe Up</a>\" function, so audiences can see the post and get details about the test. Remember, the swipe-up tool is a great one to use for backlinking. You can bring new browsers to your website without making them exit the app.</p> \n<p>Sharing buzz-worthy content will throw your company into the conversation and keep the content fresh and topical on your page.</p> \n<h3>2. Choose media that's easy to comprehend.</h3> \n<p>When you want to adapt content, think about what can be split up into small, comprehensive pieces. If an audience member is scrolling through Instagram during their lunch break, it's likely that they're not interested in reading Stories that are full of text.</p> \n<p>\"Odds are, much of your audience is on Instagram looking for quick entertainment during a work break or daily commute,\" notes Kelsey Yamada, one of HubSpot's social media managers. \"This is why my most important tip is to start your story actively rather than passively.\"</p> \n<p>Yamada suggests that, to keep audiences engaged, \"Grab the reader’s attention with an interactive element, interesting fast-fact, a video, or eye-popping graphic. Then, use the following pages of the story to go into depth about the topic.\"</p> \n<p>Let's look at a visual:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-67-AM.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-67-AM.png\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of starting a story interactively.\">\n</div> \n<p>This first tile asks the reader a question to get them thinking. The Story doesn't use much text, and instead, includes an interactive function — the<a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-the-emoji-slider-sticker\"> emoji slider sticker</a>. The next tile gives survey data to add background.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-2.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-2.png\" alt=\"How to present data in an Instagram Story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>This content is easy for audiences to engage with as a quick brain break from their busy day. It takes data that was previously collected by HubSpot and turns it into a visually appealing guess-and-check for marketers.</p> \n<p>You can use stats, like survey data, for Instagram Stories. Use short questions to engage users right off the bat, then use the following tiles to give them the full story.</p> \n<h3>3. Think about if you can make the story interactive.</h3> \n<p>One question Bump asks herself when choosing content for Stories is, <em>\"Can I make this content interactive?\" </em>For instance, you might have some less-than-glamorous topics covered on your blog or web pages, but take a look at them from a different perspective.</p> \n<p>Bump notes, \"Even a bland topic can be zested up with a quiz or poll. For example, sometimes, when adapting a post with heavy research into an Instagram Story, we’ll format the story like a quiz. Then the last page will offer readers the ability to swipe up to read more about the answers.\"</p> \n<p>For example, this story was adapted from a post about the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z?_ga=2.251058054.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">difference between millennials and Gen Z</a>:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers.png\" alt=\"How to capture audiences with statistical content in an Instagram Story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>It might not be the most exciting topic, but using Instagram Stories can make the content interactive, raising the interest level of audiences. If I were to see this story before the blog post, I would stop in my tracks and ask myself, <em>\"I think I know the difference, but what does HubSpot have to say?\"</em></p> \n<p>Alternatively, if I saw the blog post, I might not want to engage. But this story makes the content fun, gives the value of the post, and brings readers to the content in a new format. If the last tile included a link to the post, you could boost the number of reads.</p> \n<h3>4. Decide if you can make the text sparse and actionable.</h3> \n<p>\"One thing the social media teams I’ve worked with are mindful of are the amount of text and the amount of pages in each story. I’ve seen that more than a paragraph of text on one story page can result in reader fatigue, which, in turn, could cause people to drop out of your story,\" notes Yamada.</p> \n<p>Remember, it's likely that your Instagram audiences are checking their feeds as a quick brain break or a source of entertainment. Bombarding them with text-filled stories will take away from that experience.</p> \n<p>Instead of using a paragraph of text, include bullet points. This will break up text and allow for emojis, stickers, or other content that will make a story visually appealing.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-1.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-1.png\" alt=\"Example of a story with little text.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>\"If you can include a swipe-up with more content, consider a less-is-more approach where you include a quick tip, poll, or quiz related to a topic. Then, encourage the reader to swipe-up to learn more about the topic,\" recommends Yamada. \"If you can’t, but the story is more complex, consider breaking it up into a larger amount of pages.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Experiment, experiment, experiment.</h3> \n<p>What works for HubSpot's socials might not be the case for companies in different industries. So, remember to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-testing?_ga=2.19779768.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">experiment with your content</a> to find what works the best for your audience.</p> \n<p>Bump recalls, \"While you should do research and keep social media manager guidelines in mind as you craft a story strategy, don’t be afraid to try something different. For example, if you have a low drop off rate and most of your audience gets to the end of your Stories, you could experiment with a longer story to see how far they’ll get.\"</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid to think outside of the box. Sometimes, new ideas are the ones that will be the winning ticket to better engagement. That sales metric that you're unsure about sharing? Experiment with it, and see if you can change the wording to make it enjoyable.</p> \n<p>\"Regardless of which experiments you do,\" Bump continues, \"Be sure to start with a hypothesis, know which metrics you’ll be monitoring, and identify what you’ll do if the experiment works or doesn’t work. This will allow you to develop a strong set of learnings around your audience and their behaviors.\"</p> \n<p>As for metrics to look for, Bump recommends looking at story views, impressions, swipe ups, and exits. Outside of the app, analyze overall Instagram traffic, or use a tracking URL. \" If you include a swipe-up to your full web content, use a tracking URL, such as one made with HubSpot or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/\">Bit.ly</a>, as your swipe-up link,\" she says.</p> \n<p>\"A tracking URL will allow you to see how many page views you received from the story. If you have a CMS with an analytics dashboard that can distinguish social media sources, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics?_ga=2.19779768.1692937882.1597029621-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot</a>, you can also see how much traffic your post has coming from Instagram.\"</p> \n<h3>6. Be mindful of story length.</h3> \n<p>We've talked a bit about keeping the audience's attention. The length of your story could impact their engagement. So when you're choosing content, think about how many tiles it would take to convey the message. Can you do this in less than five?</p> \n<p>Yamada says, \"If someone doesn’t get to the end of your story where a swipe-up link is located, they won’t swipe up. So, I try to keep Instagram Stories content within 4-5 pages if it will include a swipe-up.\"</p> \n<p>Remember, in our personality test example, the story had five tiles. At the end of the last tile, there was a link to the corresponding blog post. This captures the reader's attention quickly and backlinks the source before they exit:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-38-AM.png?width=252&amp;name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-38-AM.png\" alt=\"How to shorten content for an Instagram Story.\" width=\"252\" style=\"width: 252px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>\"Do your best to cut the content down to the biggest takeaways. If your audience wants all the details, provide a link to the source material in a swipe-up or in the DMs if anyone reaches out. If a piece of content can't be summarized and cut down, it's not the best fit for Stories,\" Yamada explains.</p> \n<p>In the example above, the content explains a test the audience can take, where they can find it, and how to get more information. Basically, the story is used as a \"preview\" for the rest of the content. Is there content in your arsenal that's similar — like a study you just performed?</p> \n<h3>7. Put yourself in the audience's shoes.</h3> \n<p>Keeping your audience in mind is at the forefront of content creation. Remember to think about their motivation as much as their interests.</p> \n<p>\"Whenever I’ve adapted long-form content into Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook Stories, I’ve tried to imagine what my audience will be doing and thinking when they aimlessly tap through Stories and come across my brand’s,\" states Yamada.</p> \n<p>Think about how you interact with Stories on Instagram. A story that's short, simple, and includes visual elements probably keeps you more interested than a story that's too busy, with a lot of moving parts. It's jarring to tap to a story and see a huge video with no explanation, right?</p> \n<p>To choose content that your audience will be intrigued by, Bump encourages marketers to \"Think about what your audience likes to see from you on Instagram. If you get a ton of engagement on sales-related content, for example, try adapting a blog post about sales into a short-form story.\"</p> \n<p>As Yamada notes, \"Adapting your existing content into stories will give it the opportunity to provide value on a different platform to a different audience.\" If your audience misses content you want to boost, or you want to present it in a different way, take to your Stories to give it more exposure.</p> \n<p>Adapting your content into stories gives audiences a rounded view of what your brand is about from a different perspective.</p> \n<p>\"Why shouldn't more people see the awesome content you've already worked on creating?\" she asks. \"You'll also find yourself saving time when adapting content, as you won't have to create a whole new piece just for Stories. A win-win!\"</p> \n<p>These tips made me excited to jump into my content and see what I could turn into the next high-performing story. I can't wait to find new data or research that I can make more engaging with a few emojis. Plus, I feel more confident about what I can put out there. Knowing I have a solid direction now, I'm ready to be bold and experiment.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fadapting-instagram-story-content&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"fd66ed0e00a3e13ef6a55f730a8ae237","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-3.png?width=252&name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-27-785_8a4e63b807fb70f1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-4.png?width=252&name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-23-465_306424884d76024e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-67-AM.png?width=252&name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-67-AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn41@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-27-543_3f5a157e622ceb1e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-2.png?width=252&name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-20-213_58c6ab9a852d7d10.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers.png?width=252&name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn58@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-25-002_68f4f2181a72d550.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-1.png?width=252&name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn54@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-24-961_8b25fdeed94f8e54.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-38-AM.png?width=252&name=How%20to%20Adapt%20Your%20Content%20Into%20an%20Instagram%20Story,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketers-Aug-10-2020-03-07-49-38-AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-29-159_2290e3e6f21ccf61.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fadapting-instagram-story-content&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn5@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-26-821_4945f28b0e43f6fc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336434},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How 3 HubSpot Managers Found Strong Co-Marketing Partnerships [+How You Can, Too]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/co-marketing-partner-tips","description":"<p>A solid <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34188/what-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx\">co-marketing</a> partnership is one of the better ways to reach a previously untapped audience, generate positive publicity, and create a wealth of valuable marketing collateral. When done right, it's a mutually beneficial, thoroughly productive way to boost your marketing efforts as a whole.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Aligning yourself with an industry peer can pay off in spades, but these kinds of relationships aren't easy to start and sustain. Your partner's interests and qualities need to complement yours, and the companies you work with have to be reliable enough to consistently pull their weight.</p> \n<p>Finding a company that fits that bill is hard in its own right, but once you've identified one you want to work with, you're faced with the challenges of successfully contacting them, corresponding with them, and convincing them to work with you.</p> \n<p>Those processes can be hard to figure out on your own, so to offer you some help, we spoke with three HubSpot experts about how they found strong co-marketing partnerships and the steps you need to take to do the same.</p> \n<h2>What do you look for in a co-marketing partner?</h2> \n<p>When asked about what they look for in a co-marketing partner, our experts all seemed to agree that the number one priority is alignment in audience, messaging, and image. As HubSpot Senior Marketing Manager, Margot Mazur, put it, <em>\"We look for partners who speak to similar personas and address their needs. Specifically, we want to make sure our partners have a similar audience and voice — with similar values and goals to meet.\"</em></p> \n<p>Though finding a company that checks those boxes is central to a successful co-marketing partnership, there's still a lot more to the process. You might identify a potential partner that lines up well with your brand identity and appeals to a similar audience, but co-marketing partnerships need to be productive and mutually beneficial — you need to know you'll get something out of it.</p> \n<p>According to HubSpot Marketing Manager, Diego Santos, <em>\"Once we are happy with [a potential partner's] suitability, we classify them according to a co-marketing matrix — one that takes the partner's popularity, relevance, and objective into consideration. This process helps us to prioritize collaborations and look at the big picture.\"</em></p> \n<p>Ideological and objective-oriented alignment isn't enough. There needs to be hard, quantifiable potential behind a co-marketing partnership. As Mazur said,<em> \"We also look at a potential partner's audience across social and email channels, making sure that our businesses are of a similar size.\"</em></p> \n<p>Co-marketing partnerships are, at their core, strategic plays. They can be invaluable assets in targeted marketing efforts. For instance, HubSpot Marketing Manager, Clara Landecy, spoke on how they can be leveraged to target specific areas, <em>\"I always look for partners who have a strong presence in targeted regions. Partnering with local partners is essential if your company does business in multiple languages and across the globe.\"</em></p> \n<p>Santos succinctly captured all those points when he laid out the key questions to consider when finding co-marketing partners, <em>\"We usually ask ourselves the following questions to make sure they are a good fit: Who are they? What is their area of expertise? And who — and how big — is their audience?\"</em></p> \n<p>It's important to have a firm understanding of what you want out of a co-marketing partnership before approaching potential partners. Find a company with similar values that will enhance your ability to effectively reach your target audience — one that will pull its weight, complement your messaging, and ultimately suit your long term goals.</p> \n<h2>How do you approach and connect with potential co-marketing partners?</h2> \n<p>Our experts stressed the importance of a personal touch in connecting with potential co-marketing partners. As Santos put it, <em>\"A more personal, network-oriented approach is usually much more effective than a cold introductory email or message.\"</em></p> \n<p>Co-marketing partnerships are inherently personal, so it's only fitting that you start your relationship with your partner off on a <em>personal</em> note. But how do you get there?</p> \n<p>Well, according to our experts, your best bet is leveraging resources and co-workers from within your own company. Landecy said, <em>\"To increase your response rate, ask your colleagues if they have any contacts at the companies you’re looking to partner with, warm outreach always helps.\"</em></p> \n<p>Santos agreed, <em>\"We always try to leverage the connections we already have in HubSpot. When we are looking for partners in a particular area, we reach out to everyone in the relevant regional team and encourage them to send ideas of potential collaborations.\"</em></p> \n<p>Mazur reiterated their points but added some insight about what she does when she can't reach potential partners through her colleagues, <em>\"Generally, I'll see if anyone at HubSpot already has a connection to someone at the partner company. If not, I'll reach out to a partnership, BD, or marketing person at the company on LinkedIn, using their InMail tool.\"</em> As I mentioned earlier, no matter how you reach potential partners you need to do so with a personal touch.</p> \n<p>Do your homework. Make sure you have a firm grasp on the nature of the company you're contacting, what it might need out of a co-marketing partnership, and what you can do to suit its objectives and interests. Or as Landecy said, <em>\"Make sure your outreach is personalized! Showing you did the research before reaching out shows you are invested in the potential partnership and makes their work feel special!\"</em></p> \n<p>But let's say you don't have the know-how and personal connections to identify and reach potential co-marketing partners. You're at a loss when it comes to finding interested companies whose size, values, and interests line up with your own.</p> \n<p>What can you do? Well, there are certain tools designed to expedite the process. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.crossbeam.com/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_campaign=9977203105_100586914017_441699244276&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=Content+Lead+Generation+(Blog)&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=7141001143&amp;hsa_cam=9977203105&amp;hsa_grp=100586914017&amp;hsa_ad=441699244276&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=dsa-915029285266&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvOqtlKqW6wIVCTiGCh1VyQ9VEAAYASAAEgKksPD_BwE\"><span>Crossbeam</span></a> is a resource that leverages CRM data to help you find and connect with potential co-marketing partners with overlapping customer bases and other complementary attributes.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a solid co-marketing partnership has tremendous potential that's only seen after tremendous effort. It often takes extensive research and critical thought just to identify the companies that suit your values, goals, and qualities. And actually conducting the necessary outreach and communication to establish one adds a whole new, often exhausting layer to the process.</p> \n<p>Still, there's a lot to be gained from these kinds of arrangements. If your business is looking for a shot of life to your marketing efforts, pursuing a co-marketing partnership is something to consider.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fco-marketing-partner-tips&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 19:45:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b51605d148664a74132a069d63dd1ab4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"jfuchs@hubspot.com (Jay Fuchs)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fco-marketing-partner-tips&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn18@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-26-117_ce74fcca29bc477f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336428},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How to Make All Your Accounts Safer With Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/two-factor-authentication","description":"<p>Nowadays, account security is a major concern for companies and their employees.</p>  \n<p>It can pose a major threat to your employer if you're hacked — if someone hacks your Gmail account, for instance, he will have access to company contacts, as well as your calendar, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and other private company information.</p> \n<p></p>  \n<p>For this reason, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile&amp;hl=en_US\">Duo Mobile</a> and other two-factor authentication apps have risen in popularity.</p> \n<p>Two-factor authentication (or 2FA) is a safety process you can enable on any of your devices, including your iPhone, Mac, Gmail account, or social media accounts like Facebook.</p> \n<p>Here, we're going to tell you what two-factor authentication is, and how you can enable (or disable) it on any of your accounts, to ensure your information is protected.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is two-factor authentication?</strong></h2> \n<p>To understand what two-factor authentication is, let's start with an analogy.</p> \n<p>Imagine you live in a dangerous neighborhood, and you only have one lock on your door. Alternatively, your neighbor down the street has a top <em>and </em>bottom lock, and each lock requires a separate key — which means, to break into his apartment, you need to break into two locks, not just one.</p> \n<p>Who's safer?</p> \n<p>Ultimately, two-factor authentication is your neighbor's top and bottom lock — but for your online accounts. It significantly decreases the risk of getting hacked by combining two methods of protection.</p> \n<p>Two-factor authentication uses two methods to ensure you're the correct user. It combines something you know (i.e. a password), with something you have (i.e. a mobile phone), or something you are (i.e. facial recognition).</p> \n<p>For instance, to access my online school account, I need to open the Duo Mobile app on my phone, <em>and</em> input my school account's password — while a hacker might be able to guess my password, he's going to have a tougher time hacking into my phone, as well.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>How to Turn Off Two-Factor Authentication</strong></h2> \n<p>It's relatively easy to turn off two-factor authentication on any of your accounts.</p> \n<p>On Facebook, for instance, simply go to \"Settings\" and then \"Security and Login\". Find \"Use two-factor authentication\", click \"Edit\", and then switch to \"Off\".</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20to%20Make%20All%20Your%20Accounts%20Safer%20With%20Two-Factor%20Authentication%20(2FA).jpeg?width=1500&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20All%20Your%20Accounts%20Safer%20With%20Two-Factor%20Authentication%20(2FA).jpeg\" alt=\"how to turn off two factor authentification\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Alternatively, on Gmail, you'll want to go to <a href=\"http://myaccount.google.com\">http://myaccount.google.com</a>.

I made the purchase on auto-pilot. I didn't consider testing out a different brand, or purchasing one from another retailer.</p> \n<p>Toothpaste, as it turns out, is known as a \"convenience good\", which matches my buying behavior.</p> \n<p>Understanding product classification can help you understand your consumers' general buying behaviors, which will help you market your product more effectively.</p> \n<p>There are four types of product classification. Let's dive into each type, so you can determine where your product falls in the list.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>Consumer Product Classification</strong></h2> \n<p>There are four types of product classification — convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty products, and unsought goods.</p> \n<p>Let's dive into each one in more detail.</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Convenience Goods</strong></h3> \n<p>Like the Crest toothpaste example, convenience goods are products that consumers' purchase repeatedly and without much thought. Once consumers choose their convenience goods' brand-of-choice, they typically stick to it unless they see a reason to switch — such as an interesting advertisement that compels them to try it, or mere convenience at the checkout aisle.</p> \n<p>These products include toilet paper, soap, toothpaste, shampoo, milk, and other necessities that people buy over and over again.</p> \n<p>To market a convenience good, you want to consider that most people will impulse buy these products. Placing your products near the checkout line at a store could be a good idea for these products — which is why you'll often find candy and gum at the front of a store.</p> \n<p>Since most convenience goods are low-price, pricing and discounting isn't a major factor. I won't switch my toilet paper brand just to save a few cents. For convenience goods, brand recognition is key, so you'll want to implement wide-spread campaigns to spread awareness of your company if possible.</p> \n<p>For instance, Charmin toilet paper is a popular brand in the United States — likely in part due to the company's consistent and long-term advertising strategy, dating back to the <a href=\"https://www.charmin.com/en-us/about-us/charmin-history\"><span>1960's with the invention of \"Mr. Whipple\"</span></a>, a Charmin character who appeared on TV, print, and radio.</p> \n<h3><strong>2. Shopping Goods</strong></h3> \n<p>Shopping goods are commodities you likely think of when you hear the word \"shopping\". They might be higher-end items like cars or houses, or smaller items like clothing and electronics.</p> \n<p>Consumers typically spend more time conducting research, comparing prices, and chatting with salespeople when they're looking to purchase shopping goods. These are more one-off purchases, and are typically more important and higher economic-impact products compared to toilet paper or soap.</p> \n<p>For instance, while you will buy toilet paper over and over again for the rest of your life, you'll likely only purchase a house a few times at most. And, since it's an expensive and important purchase, you'll spend a good amount of time deliberating on it, attending different open houses, speaking with various retailers, and comparing pros and cons of your final selection.</p> \n<p>The same can be said for smaller products. A nice t-shirt from the Gap, for instance, isn't typically an \"impulse\" buy. Instead, you'll want to try it on, consider whether the price is worth it, and even text a picture of it to a friend.</p> \n<p>To market a shopping goods product, then, you'll want to invest in content that helps persuade your buyer that your product is worth it. It's important your marketing materials demonstrate how your product differs from the competition, and the unique value-add it provides consumers.</p> \n<p>This will vary depending on your industry and product, but ultimately, marketing shopping goods entails helping consumers understand why they should choose your product over others in the marketplace.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Specialty Goods</strong></h3> \n<p>A specialty good is the <em>only</em> product of its kind on the market, which means consumers typically don't feel the need to compare-and-contrast or deliberate as much as they would with other products.</p> \n<p>A good example of this? iPhones.</p> \n<p>I've been purchasing new iPhones for years, and I haven't paused to consider other smartphone models — <em>not </em>because an iPhone is an \"impulse\" buy, but because of the brand recognition and unique quality I feel I'm getting from an iPhone. It's the same reason people buy Mercedes. There isn't anything else on the market like it.</p> \n<p>For this reason, if you're marketing a specialty good, you don't necessarily need to spend too much time convincing consumers that your product is different from competitors. They already know it's different. Instead, your company should focus on constantly <em>innovating</em> on its previous products and producing the \"next best thing\". This will ensure your customers will remain loyal to your brand.</p> \n<p>For instance, if Apple stopped making impressive improvements on their iPhones and promoting new features, I might consider switching brands. But since they've continued to impress me over the years, I've continued to purchase from them.</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Unsought Goods</strong></h3> \n<p>Finally, unsought goods — a product that people aren't typically <em>excited </em>to buy, and also don't buy on impulse. Good examples of unsought goods include fire extinguishers, batteries, or life insurance.</p> \n<p>People will typically buy an unsought good out of a sense of fear or danger. For instance, you wouldn't go on the market looking for the \"new and best\" fire extinguisher. You'd only purchase one due to the fear of a potential fire. Alternatively, some unsought goods, like batteries, are bought simply because the old ones ran out.</p> \n<p>When marketing an unsought good, you'll want to focus on reminding consumers of the existence of your product, and convincing consumers that purchasing your product will leave them with a better sense of security.</p> \n<p>For instance, Duracell's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZs7mwIOVe0\"><span>Beach x Bear commercial</span></a> encourages viewers to remember the importance of batteries in life-threatening situations, like impending bear attacks (as well as the everyday importance of batteries, like when using a metal detector ... ).</p> \n<p>Hopefully, you can find a clear fit with your product in one of these four classifications. Use consumers' buyer behavior to inspire your next marketing campaign. How can you meet — and exceed — customers' expectations of your product type?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fproduct-classification&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"be1ad833634ff7ed246ebf15e6fc27ed","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fproduct-classification&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn96@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-27-825_4b71fab47c8e7959.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336423},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"10 Great Examples of Welcome Emails to Inspire Your Own Strategy","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/welcome-email-examples","description":"<p>We've all heard how important it is to make a good first impression. Show up late for a job interview?</p>  \n<p>That's a bad first impression. Eat a ton of garlic and forget to brush your teeth before a first date? Also a bad first impression.</p> \n<p>It turns out that the \"make a good first impression\" principle holds true not only in face-to-face encounters, but in email interactions as well.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When you send a welcome email to a new blog or newsletter subscriber, or to a new customer, you're making a first impression on behalf of your brand. To help ensure you're making the best first impression possible, we've rounded up some examples of standout welcome emails from brands big and small.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use HubSpot's <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">free email marketing software</a> to easily create a high-quality welcome email sequence like the ones featured below.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Email%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=400&amp;name=Email%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"free welcome Email Template to send to customers\"></p> \n<p>As you'll soon discover, each example below showcases different tactics and strategies for engaging new email subscribers. Let's dive in.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<h2>10 Examples of Standout Welcome Emails</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.virginamerica.com/\">Virgin America</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Get Started</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/virgin-america-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Virgin America welcome email with a red CTA to get started\" title=\"virgin-america-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>A welcome email is the perfect medium for introducing folks to the characteristics (and eccentricities) that make your brand unique.</p> \n<p>For Virgin America, that means putting the \"I love you\" hand symbol front and center. This small gesture signals to the recipient that the folks atVirgin America really care about their customers. The playful accompanying copy, \"Welcome aboard,\" and casual call-to-action, \"Grab a seat,\" also help to position Virgin America as a hip, fun-loving brand right off the bat.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://food52.com/\">Food52</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Get Started</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/food-52-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Food52 welcome email with a gray CTA to get started\" title=\"food-52-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>Sometimes the tiniest of elements in a welcome email can speak volumes about a brand. And when it comes to Food52's welcome email, their preview text at the top of the email, \"We brought snacks,\" definitely accomplishes this.</p> \n<p>Also known as a pre-header or snippet text, preview text is the copy that gets pulled in from the body of an email and displayed next to (or beneath) the subject line in someone's inbox. So when you see Food52's welcome email in your inbox, you get a taste of their brand's personality before you even open it.</p> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/preview_text-3.png\" alt=\"preview_text-3.png\" title=\"preview_text-3.png\"></p> \n<p>Food52's welcome email also does a good job of building trust by putting a face (make that two faces) to their name. As soon as you open the email, you see a photograph of -- and welcome message from -- the company's founders.</p> \n<h3>3. Monday.com</h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Video</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/monday.com-video-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Monday.com welcome email with a link to watch a video by CEO Roy Man\"></p> \n<p>From the subject line to the conversational tone in the email body, the welcome email above keeps it friendly and simple so the focus stays on the introductory video inside.</p> \n<p>Monday.com is a task management tool for teams and businesses, and the welcome email you get when you sign up makes you feel like the CEO, Roy Man, is talking directly to you. The email even personalizes the opening greeting by using the recipient's first name -- this is well known for <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">increasing email click-through rates</a> (especially if the name is in the subject line).</p> \n<p>The closer you can get to making your email sound like a one-on-one conversation between you and your subscriber, the better. If you have just so many details you need to inform your new customer of, follow Monday.com's lead and embed them in a video, rather than spelling them all out in the email itself.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.katespade.com/\">Kate Spade</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Thank You</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/kate-spade-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Kate Spade welcome email with orange envelope graphic saying thank you\" title=\"kate-spade-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>Let's face it: We, the internet-using public, are constantly bombarded with prompts to sign up for and subscribe to all sorts of email communications. So as a brand, when someone takes the time to sift through all the chaos in order to intentionally sign up for <em>your</em> email communications, it's a big deal.</p> \n<p>In order to acknowledge how grateful they are to the folks who actually take the time to subscribe, Kate Spade uses a simple -- but effective -- tactic with their welcome emails: They say \"Thank You\" in big, bold lettering. And by placing that \"Thank You\" on an envelope, Kate Spade recreates the feeling of receiving an actual thank-you letter in the mail. (The 15% off discount code doesn't hurt either.)</p> \n<h3>5. Lyft</h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Get Started</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lyft-welcome-email.png?width=690&amp;name=lyft-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Lyft welcome email with pink CTA to get started\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p>If there's an ideal \"attitude\" that welcome emails should give off, Lyft has got it.</p> \n<p>The company's simple but vibrant welcome email, shown above, focuses entirely on the look and feel of the app, delivering a design that's as warm and smooth as the lifts that Lyft wants to give you. At the same time, the email's branded pink call-to-action draws your eyes toward the center of the page to \"Take a Ride\" -- inviting language that doesn't make you feel pressured as a new user.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/\" style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">IKEA</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Offer</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ikea-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"IKEA welcome email with offer to join free membership\" title=\"ikea-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>It might not be the most beautifully designed email on this list, but that doesn't mean IKEA's welcome email isn't effective.</p> \n<p>Instead of going for the hard sell (e.g., \"By stuff now!\"), or explaining what it is they do (which is something IKEA probably assumes most people already know), IKEA uses its welcome email to turn folks onto its other, lesser-known programs and content channels. For example, there's a call-to-action right at the top that explains the value of its member benefits program. There are also prompts to visit their design blog and to contribute to their collaborative \"Share Space\" site.</p> \n<p>Of course, if you're not interested in any of that stuff, IKEA's welcome email also makes it easy for you to simply log in and start shopping (there's a login field right up top).</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"http://www.michaels.com/\">Michaels</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Offer</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/michaels-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Michaels welcome email with offer of 20% off an entire purchase\" title=\"michaels-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>The Michaels approach to the welcome email borrows elements from both Kate Spade and Virgin America. In addition to expressing gratitude to the folks who took the time to sign up, Michaels uses its welcome email to showcase the brand. And the company does a great job: The lengthy email feels like one big arts and crafts project, complete with paint, yarn, and chalkboards.</p> \n<p>Another standout feature of this welcome email is that Michaels makes it immediately clear what value its future email communications are going to provide. After thanking subscribers, there's this nice bit of copy that sums it up:</p> \n<p>\"We're going to send fun stuff like DIY tips and tricks, invites to in-store events, and exclusive deals and coupons.\"</p> \n<h3>8. Sphero</h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Hello</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sphero-welcome-email.png?width=690&amp;name=sphero-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"Sphero welcome email with BB-8 Star Wars Droid saying hello\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p>Sphero's welcome email might in fact be the cutest one we've seen recently -- and it was sent from a galaxy far, far away.</p> \n<p>If you purchase a bluetooth-controlled BB-8, the friendly Droid from <em>Star Wars</em>, it was probably made by Sphero. And if it was, you'll have an email similar to the one above waiting in your inbox when you activate your new rolling companion.</p> \n<p>This email's subject line is what qualifies it for this list -- \"A little Droid told us you wanted our emails.\" By cleverly personifying the product, and being somewhat candid about its <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">email marketing</a> newsletters, Sphero develops a relationship with their recipients through the product you just bought from them.</p> \n<p>Besides showing you how to use your new BB-8 Droid with your smartphone, all this welcome email wanted to do was say hi -- just like BB-8 himself.</p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\">InVision</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Video</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/invision-welcome-email.png\" alt=\"InVision welcome email with link to watch video\" title=\"invision-welcome-email.png\"></p> \n<p>When you sign up for InVision's free prototyping app, the welcome email makes it very clear what your next step should be: using the app.</p> \n<p>To facilitate this action, InVision's welcome email doesn't simply list out what you need to do in order to get started. Instead, it <em>shows you</em> what you need to do with a series of quick videos. Given the visual, interactive nature of the product, this makes a lot of sense.</p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"http://www.drift.com/\">Drift</a></h3> \n<h4>Type of welcome: Get Started</h4> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/drift-welcome-email-1.png\" alt=\"Drift welcome email with link to get started\" title=\"drift-welcome-email-1.png\"></p> \n<p>No fancy design work. No videos. No photos. The welcome email Drift sends out after signing up for their newsletter is a lesson in minimalism.</p> \n<p>The email opens with a bit of candid commentary on the state of email. \"Most people have really long welcome email sequences after you get on their email list,\" Dave from Drift writes, before continuing: \"Good news: we aren't most people.\" What follows is simply a bulleted list of the company's most popular blog posts. And the only mention of the product comes in a brief post-script at the very end.</p> \n<p>If you're trying to craft a welcome email that's non-interruptive, and that's laser-focused on adding value vs. fluff, this is a great example to follow.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April, 2016 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwelcome-email-examples&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 15:08:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"dd3aad22891870a7e45a5d47ea543ca0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"edevaney@hubspot.com (Erik Devaney)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Email%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=400&name=Email%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-22-187_03a99e311eca0ea0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/virgin-america-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn97@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-28-584_8fdeac7429e2fd25.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/food-52-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn74@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-28-424_ce0f7ae78d84f539.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/preview_text-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn98@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-20-944_8ead1ba4a4c18e18.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/monday.com-video-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-28-632_6da7f4217aa13774.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/kate-spade-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn1@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-26-635_d1744136ddd5194f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lyft-welcome-email.png?width=690&name=lyft-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn77@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-24-071_35eb0c271499fe78.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ikea-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-26-280_ea99e095eb844cf1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/michaels-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-22-23-101_d651c206de0777df.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sphero-welcome-email.png?width=690&name=sphero-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-20-110_c2c78bb8f30c40d7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/invision-welcome-email.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn59@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-21-315_e35af7101e39b26a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/drift-welcome-email-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-19-945_08c1ef8de2ef95cd.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwelcome-email-examples&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-26-981_9041613ae476bd94.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336435},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"How to Write a Request for Proposal with Template and Sample","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template","description":"<p>Whether you’re working for a small agency or a major marketing firm, you’re probably eventually going to need to fill out a Request for Proposal, or RFP.</p> \n<p>Your company can’t do everything internally, and when your business needs to purchase a product or service from elsewhere, you might need to shop around. An RFP allows you to collect offers from various vendors and select the vendor that best meets your criteria, both in regards to skill and budget.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Any time you outsource work to a supplier, there's a potential for issues such as miscommunication around the scope of the work and the compensation. What a good RFP does is eliminate gray area so that both parties understand what needs to be delivered, when, and for how much.</p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: 0.01em;\"></span></p> \n<h2><strong>RFP Template</strong></h2> \n<p>Here, we’ve provided an RFP template you can follow for initial structure, as well as a sample RFP for further inspiration.

At the top of a standard RFP, you'll find the following:</p> \n<p><em>Project Name or Description</em></p> \n<p><em>Company Name</em></p> \n<p><em>Address</em></p> \n<p><em>City, State, Zip Code</em></p> \n<p><em>Procurement Contact Person</em></p> \n<p><em>Telephone Number of PCP</em></p> \n<p><em>Email Address of PCP</em></p> \n<p><em>Fax Number<br /></em></p> \n<p>The body of the RFP will contain additional details about the project, including:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#background\">Background/Introduction</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#goals-scope\">Project Goals and Scope of Services</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#selection-schedule\">Anticipated Selection Schedule</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#proposal-submission\">Time and Place of Submission of Proposals</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#timeline\">Timeline</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#elements\">Elements of Proposal</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#evaluation-criteria\">Evaluation Criteria</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#roadblocks\">Possible Roadblocks</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template#budget\">Budget</a></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Read on to learn more about what goes into each of these sections so that you can build an RFP of your own.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Background/Introduction</h3> \n<p>In your introductory paragraph, you’ll want to include useful background information about your company — who founded it, what product or service your company offers, what sets you apart from competitors, and where you’re located. If any vendor is serious about working with you, they’ll want this information before moving forward.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>2. Project Goals and Scope of Services</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to outline the project you need completed, and the goals you expect to accomplish from the project. It’s important you get as specific as possible — even outlining individual tasks and criteria involved. You’ll want to include phrases such as “The award will be given to X firm,” with the “X” establishing how you’ll determine the best candidate.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>3. Anticipated Selection Schedule</h3> \n<p>It’s crucial you include a detailed schedule so vendors know if they can meet your deadlines. You’ll also need to give vendors a window for when they can ask questions regarding your project. This’ll limit the hassle, for you and for them.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>4. Time and Place of Submission of Proposals</h3> \n<p>Similar to paragraph #3, this is important information you’ll want to clearly present, so vendors know how and where to submit themselves for consideration.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>5. Timeline</h3> \n<p>By including a time frame in your RFP, you’re able to eliminate any vendor who can’t work within your time constraints. If you’re flexible on your time, you can write something like, “Our company hopes to finish the project within six months, but we’re open to negotiation for the right candidate.”</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>6. Elements of Proposal</h3> \n<p>If you don’t outline clearly and specifically what you expect bidders to include in their proposal, you can’t necessarily fault them if they don’t include it. It’s critical you outline a checklist so vendors know which elements you’re expecting to receive. It’s also a good test for who’s capable of handling your demands — if a vendor can’t complete all elements of your proposal, you probably can’t trust them to finish your project, either.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>7. Evaluation Criteria</h3> \n<p>Outlining your expectations will help eliminate vendors who don’t meet them. For this section, you’ll want to do some brainstorming with your team to come up with a mandatory list of items you feel are the best indicators of impressive candidates. Your list could include samples of past work, a proven success record with companies in similar industries, the expertise and technical skills to meet your demands, and a cost of services within your price range.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>8. Possible Roadblocks</h3> \n<p>Here, you’ll want to outline any roadblocks, such as limited resources or a custom website, that might prevent certain vendors from successfully completing the project. This allows you to eliminate unsatisfactory bidders, and it will also help you determine which vendors have the skills and expertise to tackle those challenges.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>9. Budget</h3> \n<p>Any vendor needs to know how much you’re able to pay them for their services before they’ll move forward with their bid.</p> \n<h2><strong>RFP Sample</strong></h2> \n<p>The above elements might manifest on the page in a number of ways. For example, here is an RFP sample from TemplateLab.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rfp-sample-templatelab.jpg?width=485&amp;name=rfp-sample-templatelab.jpg\" alt=\"rfp sample templatelab with tables and red headings\" width=\"485\" style=\"width: 485px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://templatelab.com/request-for-proposal/\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image Source&nbsp;</span></em></a></img></p> \n<p>Now that you understand the elements of an RFP , you can build your own template and then fill it out so that you can start accepting bids. We'll use a fictitious company, Caroline's Websites, Inc., to illustrate exactly how each section should be executed, starting with the header:</p> \n<p><em>Project Name or Description: Marketing Services</em></p> \n<p><em>Company Name: Caroline’s Websites, Inc.</em></p> \n<p><em>Address: 302 Inbound Ave.</em></p> \n<p><em>City, State, Zip Code: Boston, MA 29814</em></p> \n<p><em>Procurement Contact Person: Caroline Forsey</em></p> \n<p><em>Telephone Number of PCP: 227-124-2481</em></p> \n<p><em>Email Address of PCP: cforsey@consulting.com</em></p> \n<p><em>Fax Number: N/A<br /></em></p> \n<p>Next, we'll go into each of the elements of the RFP with information using the same fictitious company.&nbsp;<br><br /></br></p> \n<h3>1.

Anticipated Selection Schedule</h3> \n<p>The Request for Proposal timeline is as follows:</p> \n<p>Request for RFP: June 1, 2020</p> \n<p>Deadline for Bidders to Submit Questions: July 5, 2020</p> \n<p>[Company Name] Responds to Bidder Questions: July 20, 2020</p> \n<p>Selection of Top Bidders / Notification to Unsuccessful Bidders: July 31, 2020</p> \n<p>Start of Negotiation: August 5, 2020</p> \n<p>Contract Award / Notification to Unsuccessful Bidders: August 31, 2020</p> \n<h3>4. Time and Place of Submission of Proposals</h3> \n<p>The RFP will be posted on our website, Carolinewebsites.com, and can be downloaded from there directly as of 10 a.m. on June 1, 2020.</p> \n<p>Respondents to this RFP must submit one original and five copies of their proposal. Responses must be received no later than July 25, 2020. Responses should be clearly marked “RFP-MarketingServices” and mailed or delivered to the contact person listed above.</p> \n<h3>5. Timeline</h3> \n<p>Caroline’s Websites, Inc. needs the project completed within 8 months.</p> \n<h3>6. Elements of Proposal</h3> \n<p>A submission must, at a minimum, include the following elements:</p> \n<p>• Description of the firm that includes a general overview, names and credentials of creative team, number of full-time employees.</p> \n<p>• A one-page narrative outlining the firm’s strengths and distinguishing skills or capabilities as they might relate to Caroline’s Websites, Inc.</p> \n<p>• A representative selection of social media ads, direct response material, collateral, and website development created for current and past clients.</p> \n<h3>7. Evaluation Criteria</h3> \n<p>The successful respondent will:</p> \n<p>• Have been operating continuously as a marketing agency for a minimum of 24 months and possess full-service, in-house capabilities for marketing, creative services, production, media planning and placement, direct response and research.</p> \n<p>• The education, experience, knowledge, skills, and qualifications of the firm and the individuals who will be available to provide these services.</p> \n<p>• The competitive cost of services.</p> \n<p>• The expertise of the firm in working with similar customers.</p> \n<h3>8. Possible Roadblocks</h3> \n<p>At this time, Caroline’s Websites, Inc. currently has custom coding on our website, of which bidders should be aware.</p> \n<h3>9. Budget</h3> \n<p>Caroline’s Websites, Inc.’s budget for the project is $8,750.00.</p> \n<p>These elements were written in a way to clarify the scope of the project that Caroline's Websites, Inc. wants completed so that suppliers know whether or not to make a bid. Defining the project allows the bidder to determine if they're a good fit and how much they'd likely charge. Being as transparent as possible serves to benefit (and even protect) <em>both </em>parties in the long run.</p> \n<p>To use some of these elements in your own RFP, start with an RFP template and adjust it to your liking.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in June 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Frfp-template&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b16f44ad020dd479d55a150de2981c30","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Request%20for%20Project%20Proposal%20(RPT)%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=1500&name=Request%20for%20Project%20Proposal%20(RPT)%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-21-018_59851a7ee2fb2497.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rfp-sample-templatelab.jpg?width=485&name=rfp-sample-templatelab.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn69@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-20-788_f309d07aeec0f7ac.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Frfp-template&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-22-27-947_f7220c7d633eea49.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336436},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"29 Free Resume Templates for Microsoft Word (& How to Make Your Own)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resume-templates-word","description":"<p>No matter what industry you work in (or your experience level in that industry), a plain, black-and-white resume written in Times New Roman font can actually weaken a job application.</p>  \n<p>But just because resumes have gotten more creative doesn’t mean you need special design software to make your application stand out.

Open Microsoft Word on your computer.</h3> \n<p>If you have Microsoft Word installed on your computer, open the program and let it load for a moment. There will be a couple of helpful options waiting for you on the first screen, specifically for resume creation.</p> \n<h3>2. Select either \"Basic Resume\" or \"Bold Resume\" from the template menu.</h3> \n<p>Once you've launched MS Word, a window of templates will appear. Scroll down until you see the template options designed for resumes -- there will be at least two of them. Double-click the one that suits your style and personal brand, but don't be too particular about design just yet ... you can customize these templates quite a bit.</p> \n<h3>3. Fill in your name and contact information at the top.</h3> \n<p>When your resume template opens, you'll see placeholder text for each line of your resume, starting with your first and last name at the top. Delete this header text and enter your name, as well as any contact information by which you want the recruiter to contact you.</p> \n<h3>4. Draft a brief summary of your experience and goals.</h3> \n<p>Use the first line below your name and contact info to describe who you are, what you do, and what you're looking for in your career.</p> \n<h3>5. Enter your school and latest education.</h3> \n<p>List any relevant degrees or certificates you received through schooling. You can safely exclude secondary education if you've graduated from an accredited college.</p> \n<h3>6. Describe each job you've held using the lines prompted on the template.</h3> \n<p>Your professional experience is frequently the most important section of your resume, so feel free to rank this section <em>above</em> your skills and education, depending on how many jobs you previously held.</p> \n<h3>7. List all relevant skills.</h3> \n<p>If you have experience in certain software, exercises, problem-solving, or management techniques, use them to populate your skills. Your resume's \"Skills\" section helps reveal what all of your previous jobs or related experiences have in common, based on what they taught you and what you provided them.</p> \n<h3>8. Describe any relevant accolades and accomplishments.</h3> \n<p>Finish out your resume with any personal accomplishments or accolades you think a hiring manager in your industry would appreciate. Although this section shouldn't include a <em>Most Improved</em> recognition from little league, for example, it should definitely include your <em>Marketer of the Month</em> award from your last position.</p> \n<h2><span>Free Resume Templates That Download in Word</span></h2> \n<p>Of course, if you’re already employed full-time, it’s hard to find the time to apply to a new job opportunity, let alone update your resume to reflect your qualifications. Luckily, there are numerous publishers out there who've created incredible resume templates for quick editing and formatting in Word.</p> \n<p>To keep you from hunting the internet for the resume templates that are both free and compatible with MS Word, we’ve listed 19 more options below for you to customize with your own information right now. Some of them come with variations so you can pick your favorite design. Four of them cater specifically to marketers.</p> \n<p>They’re so nice, you won’t believe they open up in Microsoft Word once you download them.</p> \n<h3>1. Monogram Header Resume Template</h3> \n<p>We'll start with a simple one. This is a HubSpot exclusive resume template that is simple and clean with attractive monogrammed headers to call out each section of the resume. The rest of the design relies on a simple serif font for easy reading, which is a good thing considering that hiring managers only take <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90263970/your-resume-only-gets-7-4-seconds-to-make-an-impression-heres-how-to-stand-out\">7.4 seconds</a> to evaluate a resume.

It's also easily customizable with no difficult-to-manipulate tables or formatting. The sidebars are in movable text boxes that can even be removed if you wish.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Maroon%20Sidebar%20Resume%20Template.docx\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Maroon%20Sidebar%20Resume%20Template.docx\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Maroon%20Sidebar%20Resume.png?width=451&amp;name=Maroon%20Sidebar%20Resume.png\" alt=\"Maroon Sidebar Resume\" width=\"451\" style=\"width: 451px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></a></p> \n<h3>3. Centered Bar Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This resume takes on a different look than most resumes, centered around a single bar. This makes the resume more visually striking, which could draw attention as hiring managers are evaluating candidates. It also puts emphasis on the objective with your chronological experience supporting it underneath. All of this is in an attractive serif font that is elegant and classy.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Centered%20Bar%20Resume%20Template.docx\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Centered%20Bar%20Resume%20Template.docx\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Centered%20Bar%20Resume.png?width=451&amp;name=Centered%20Bar%20Resume.png\" alt=\"Centered Bar Resume\" width=\"451\" style=\"width: 451px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></a></p> \n<h3>4. Bold Serif Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Speaking of serif font, this resume puts forward an element of grace and formality with its font choices. It's perfect for individuals who are looking for more organic color than the ones more typically found in resumes, and the colors are also easily changed in Microsoft Word's theme settings. It also includes a skill-level bar, adding a nice visual touch to the template.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Bold%20Serif%20Resume%20Template.docx\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/blog-files/Bold%20Serif%20Resume%20Template.docx\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bold%20Serif%20Resume.png?width=415&amp;name=Bold%20Serif%20Resume.png\" alt=\"Bold Serif Resume\" width=\"415\" style=\"width: 415px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></a></p> \n<h3>5. Modern Chronological Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This resume template is available from Microsoft itself, and it’s one of many free templates the company has prepared for those who depend on Microsoft Office tools to create content. Yes, it is written in Times New Roman — don’t freak out.</p> \n<p>Designs like this can borrow an old-school typeface and still impress recruiters with a clean layout and subtle use of color. You can also change the font if you wish (and the same goes for every template in our list).</p> \n<h4>Download this template <a href=\"https://templates.office.com/en-us/Chronological-Resume-Modern-design-TM16402488\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/modern%20chronological%20resume%20template-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=modern%20chronological%20resume%20template-1.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Modern chronological resume template for MS Word\"></p> \n<h3>6. Digital Marketing Resume Template</h3> \n<p>The digital marketing resume below comes from our own collection of resume templates, all of which open directly in MS Word.</p> \n<p>Coming with two pages total, this sheet holds a wealth of information and offers the perfect amount of style while maintaining professionalism. Mid-level marketers all the way up to CMOs can find this template valuable.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-resume-templates\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/digital-marketing-executive-resume-template.png?width=455&amp;name=digital-marketing-executive-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Digital marketing resume template\" width=\"455\" style=\"width: 455px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>7. Simple and Clean Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This template is the perfect balance of creative and modest -- best for the professional who wants to seem casual, thoughtful, but not over the top.</p> \n<p>Not only does it feature a space for a headshot on the top-left, but you can customize the color of that entire panel. Created by Zoki Design, the resume template also comes with a matching cover letter template.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"http://zokidesign.com/portfolio/free-resume-template/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/simple%20and%20clean%20resume%20template-1.png?width=500&amp;name=simple%20and%20clean%20resume%20template-1.png\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Simple and clean resume template for MS Word\"></p> \n<h3>8. Black and White Resume Template</h3> \n<p>The Black and White resume template below suits professionals who prefer using color and shading to add structure to their resume.</p> \n<p>The black banner at the top contrasts the applicant's name nicely to help make him/her more memorable to recruiters. The gray banner just below the header is perfect for a summary or career objective — it makes one's goals known but doesn't overpower the experience listed below it.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://resumegenius.com/resume-templates/creative-resume-templates#the-pantheon-resume-templates\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/black-and-white-resume-template.png?width=455&amp;name=black-and-white-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Black and white resume template\" width=\"455\" style=\"width: 455px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>9. Urban Development Resume Template</h3> \n<p>The illustration on the top-left of this template shows who the designers at Hloom had in mind for this resume: civil engineers. But because it’s a Word document, that graphic is easy to edit and replace with an image that represents your line of work. Are you an analytics buff? Design a clever bar or line graph icon and place it next to your name in blue (or whatever color you’d like!).</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.hloom.com/get/urban+development/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/urban%20development%20resume%20template-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=urban%20development%20resume%20template-1.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Civil engineer's resume template for MS Word\"></p> \n<h3>10. Email Marketing Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Red color never fails to stick out on a sheet of paper, especially if it's included in small amounts. The resume template for email marketers, below, captures that balance.</p> \n<p>In addition to the professional title in the top-righthand corner, this template also stands out with a thin sans-serif font, helping make a lot of text easier for a recruiter to digest and read through.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-resume-templates\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-marketing-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=email-marketing-resume-template.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Email marketing resume template with red header text\"></p> \n<h3>11. Info Pop Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This one, also from Hloom, gives you exactly what the name suggests: ample space for the <em>info</em> you need, with headers that <em>pop</em> just enough to get your employer’s attention.</p> \n<p>Although the template fits a ton of text, its soft color palate prevents the document from seeming overwhelming.</p> Download this template \n<a href=\"https://www.hloom.com/get/info+pop/\">here</a>.\n<br> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/info%20pop%20resume%20template-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=info%20pop%20resume%20template-1.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Info Pop resume template for MS Word\"></p> \n<h3>12. Dark Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Ironically, a dark background could be just the thing to ensure your resume doesn't fall into the black hole of resumes piled on the hiring manager's desk.</p> \n<p>Using soft, yellow font, the resume template below inverts the usual color scheme of a resume without trying too hard to be creative.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/dark-resume-template-freebie-elegant-dark-grey/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dark-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=dark-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Dark resume template with black background and yellow font\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>13. Neat and Confident Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Similar to the Simple and Clean template mentioned earlier, this resume design by Nowpixelse communicates a truly professional tone. The template’s muted colors work very well with the side panel layered over the top header.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"http://nowpixelse.com/my-product/free-ms-word-resume\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/neat%20and%20confident%20resume%20template-1.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=neat%20and%20confident%20resume%20template-1.jpg\" alt=\"Neat and Confident resume template for MS Word\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>14. Inbound Marketing Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Here's another resume template dedicated to the digital marketer. This sheet offers all the inbound marketing language you need to express your values as a passionate, brand-loyal professional.</p> \n<p>Similar to a few other templates on this list, it also uses just a dash of vibrant color in the applicant's name at the top (where it matters most).</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-resume-templates\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/inbound-marketing-intern-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=inbound-marketing-intern-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Inbound marketing template for interns and marketers\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>15. Smart and Professional Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This is another sharp template that offers a basic but confident design for any professional. The warm-colored panel on the right-hand side is pre-formatted for a written profile, where you can write a summary of your background or a form letter to each employer.</p> \n<p>Just be sure to personalize this messaging to each new recipient so it works for the job you’re applying to. This template is available on Freesumes, and is free to users once they share the page to Facebook or Twitter.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/free-creative-resume-design-smart-professional/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/smart%20and%20professional%20resume%20template-1.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=smart%20and%20professional%20resume%20template-1.jpg\" alt=\"Smart and Professional resume template for MS Word\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>16. Spick and Span Resume Template</h3> \n<p>There isn't a better name for the template below. The Spick and Span resume might be the cleanest-looking sheet on this list.</p> \n<p>It uses boldface, all-caps, and gray typeface to structure various headers of the document differently and maximize the hiring manager's reading experience. And all that minimalism makes the professional headshot at the top pop off the page.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/spick-span-clean-resume-template-freebie/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/spick-and-span-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=spick-and-span-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Spick and Span resume template with clean, bold typeface and professional headshot\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>17. Timeline-Style Resume Template</h3> \n<p>Similar to the Centered Bar resume earlier in the post, Hloom’s Timeline template is a super simple but creative way to tell your story.</p> \n<p>You can convey your progression through various jobs you’ve held on one side of the vertical line, and more static elements of your background — such as skills and education — on the other.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.hloom.com/get/timeline/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/timeline-style%20resume%20template-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=timeline-style%20resume%20template-2.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Timeline-style resume template for MS Word\"></p> \n<h3>18. Content Production Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This basic resume template is suited for content producers at all stages in their career. By spreading out the header and \"Skills\" text horizontally, the resume below fits a lot of crucial information comfortably on one page (of course, it also comes with a second page if you need it).</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-resume-templates\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-production-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=content-production-resume-template.png\" alt=\"Content production resume template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>19. Fresh Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This is perhaps the most imaginative of all the Word-based resume templates on this list — with both a skills meter and a comic headshot.</p> \n<p>The template was designed by <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/venkatanaresh\">Venkata Naresh</a> and comes with 12 different versions of the design you see below. Have you created a <a href=\"https://www.bitmoji.com/\">Bitmoji</a> of yourself? Do you think your employer would find it creative? Match the template and add it as your photo.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"http://smashresume.com/downloads/professional-fresh-resume/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/fresh%20resume%20template-1.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=fresh%20resume%20template-1.jpg\" alt=\"Resume template for MS Word with space for comic headshot\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>20. CV Resume Template</h3> \n<p>The curriculum vitae-style resume below flips the typical two-column resume so the basic applicant information is listed across the right side, rather than the left.</p> \n<p>Feel free to change the color of this sidebar in Microsoft Word if dark-red isn't your thing — the template can pull off any color you wish.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/unconventional-cv-template-giveaway-avant-garde/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cv-resume-template.png?width=1500&amp;name=cv-resume-template.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Reverse two-column resume template in CV style with red sidebar\"></p> \n<h3>21. Goldenrod Resume Template</h3> \n<p>This template, also offered on Freesumes, dares to use yellow as the dominant color — but doesn’t sacrifice professionalism in the process.</p> \n<p>The document anchors the education section to a thick, bright banner across the bottom, but you can likely change this to a skills section with some simple editing in Microsoft Word.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.freesumes.com/goldenrod-yellow-a-free-clean-word-resume-template/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/goldenrod%20resume%20template-1.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=goldenrod%20resume%20template-1.jpg\" alt=\"Goldenrod yellow resume template for MS Word\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>22. Resume Template With Personal Endorsements</h3> \n<p>This resume template has quite a flashy header — no photography pun intended — but it’s not just for photographers. What makes this resume unique is the space for references on the lower right-hand side.</p> \n<p>Does your field need others to vouch for your experience? This resume gives you room for three solid recommendations.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Download this template <a href=\"https://www.hloom.com/get/personal+endorsements/\">here</a>.</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/resume%20template%20with%20personal%20endorsements-2.png?width=1500&amp;name=resume%20template%20with%20personal%20endorsements-2.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Photographer's resume template for MS Word with space for recommendations and endorsements\"></p> \n<h3>23.

successful sports coach how they win so many games, and they’ll tell you they have a unique plan for every single game they coach. To have a fighting chance against any of their opponents, they need to prepare a specific game plan tailored to each of their opponents’ strengths and weaknesses. Otherwise, they’ll get crushed.</p>  \n<p>The same logic applies to business. If you want to build a thriving company that can pull ahead of the competition, you need to prepare yourself for battle before you break into a market. Because companies who can find gaps in your business model will quickly learn how to fill those gaps and solve your customers’ problems better than you can.</p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">The business world moves fast, and it’s full of ambitious companies scrambling to gain the majority of their industry’s market share. So how do you keep up? Writing a viable business plan and following it religiously is one of the most important first steps.</p> \n<p>Business plans guide you along the rocky journey of growing a company. Referencing one throughout your voyage will keep you on the path toward success. And if your business plan is compelling enough, it can also convince investors to give you funding.</p> \n<p>But how do you actually write a viable and convincing business plan?</p> \n<p>Below, let's review the format of a business plan and sample business plans you can use to inspire your own.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Business Plan Format</h2> \n<p>Before you get started on your business plan, you might be wondering, <em>\"Where do I start? How should I format this?\"</em></p> \n<p>Typically, a business plan is a document that will detail how a company will achieve its goals.</p> \n<p>Most business plans include the following sections:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Executive summary: This section will include an overview of the company, your unique value proposition, and a team overview.</li> \n <li>Market opportunity: This is where you'll detail the opportunity in the market. Where is the gap in the current industry and how will your product fill that gap?</li> \n <li>Key features and benefits: At some point in your business plan, you'll review the key features and benefits of your products and/or services.</li> \n <li>Pricing and revenue: This is where you'll discuss your cost structure and various revenue streams.</li> \n <li>Target audience: This section will describe who your customer segments are in detail. What is the demographic and psychographic information of your audience?</li> \n <li>Marketing strategy: Here, you'll discuss how you'll acquire new customers with your marketing strategy.</li> \n <li>Competitive landscape: This is where you'll detail who the top competitors are.</li> \n <li>Financials: This is where you'll detail the funding that's required and discuss investment opportunities.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While some business plans might include more or less information, these are the key details you'll want to include.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind, that each of these sections will be formatted differently. Some may be in paragraph format, while others will be in charts.</p> \n<p>Now that you know what's included and how to format a business plan, let's review some templates.</p> \n<h2>Sample Business Plan Templates</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/one-page-business-plan?hubs_post-cta=imagesir\">HubSpot's One-Page Business Plan</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg\" alt=\"ffree editable one-page business plan pdf template\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=imagesir\"><em>Download a free, editable one-page business plan template.&nbsp;</em></a></p> \n<p>The business plan linked above was created here at HubSpot, and is perfect for businesses of any size -- no matter how much strategy they still have to develop.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Including fields such as Company Description, Required Funding, and Implementation Timeline, this one-page business plan&nbsp;gives businesses a framework for how to build their brand and what tasks to keep track of as they grow.

The images in this template are cutting edge, which makes sense for an innovative company like Plum. When you create your own business plan, make sure that the pictures and design you use make sense for your branding.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the financial charts included are incredibly helpful if you're not sure what financial information to include.</p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByPuznSKHuX_THJ5YmtDWjgxNDg/view\">LiveShopBuy Sample Business Plan</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/live-shop-buy-sample-business-plan.jpg?width=345&amp;name=live-shop-buy-sample-business-plan.jpg\" alt=\"LiveShopBuy business plan.\" width=\"345\" style=\"width: 345px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>With this business plan, the focus is the investment opportunity. This is an excellent template to use if you're going to use your business plan as a means to receive funding. The investment opportunity section is placed right up front and is several pages long.

Brand Awareness</h3> \n<p>As you may have guessed, these ads help <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness?_ga=2.203484816.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">increase people’s awareness of your business</a>. If you’re looking to introduce your brand to new audiences, this can be a great option. That's because Facebook will show these ads to members of your target audience who are more likely to pay attention to and recall the ads.</p> \n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1029827880390718?id=429023050853196\">predicts recall ability</a> by polling users on whether they remember seeing an ad and analyzing their past behavior and interactions with ads.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind the sole focus of these ads is to make people aware of your brand, so you shouldn’t expect significant engagement or click-throughs. However, they <em>will</em> help you establish brand familiarity and pique the interest of your target audience.</p> \n<p>Use these ads to keep consumers aware of, and able to recall, your brand as well as highlight what makes your business and product/service unique.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to increase the chances of your target audience recognizing and recalling your brand, and the features that make it stand out from competitors.</p> \n<h3>2. Reach</h3> \n<p>Facebook reach ads are shown to as many people in your target audience as possible while staying within your budget constraints. You can even specify the specific location you would like your audience to be in, so the ad only reaches people near your business. An added bonus is the ability to choose the frequency of these ads, meaning how many times someone will see the ad.</p> \n<p>On one hand, this strategy maximizes the number of people who see your ad. On the other, Facebook doesn’t take into consideration the likelihood of the user paying attention to the ad. Meaning, you may end up paying for your ad to be displayed to audience members who tend to scroll past any form of advertisement on the platform.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to send your business message to as many of your target audience members as possible, even if it means attempting to reach those who typically ignore ads. This objective can work well for local businesses.</p> \n<h2>Consideration Facebook Campaign Objectives</h2> \n<p>Consideration objectives encourage audiences to think and learn more about your business.</p> \n<h3>3. Traffic</h3> \n<p>The traffic objective aims to send people from Facebook to any URL of your choosing, such as your website’s homepage, online storefront, app, event page, etc.</p> \n<p>Facebook does this by showing your ads to users who are likely to click based on their past behavior on the platform (newsflash: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy\">Facebook knows a lot about its users</a>). By bringing more visitors to your featured destination, you’ll increase the likelihood of a user taking favorable actions on your landing page.</p> \n<p>Note that, with the traffic objective, Facebook is only responsible for collecting clicks and does not measure any action(s) — or lack thereof — a user takes once they leave the platform.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to direct viewers to a new URL destination so they can learn more about what you’re offering or promoting.</p> \n<h3>4. Engagement</h3> \n<p>Also based on past behavior, the platform shows engagement ads to those who they predict will engage with your ads in the form of likes, reactions, comments, and shares. The are 3 types of engagement ads: <strong>post engagement, page likes, and event responses</strong>.</p> \n<p>Post engagement and page likes will boost engagement for your ad and Facebook business page respectively. Event response engagement ads are a unique way to promote your event to increase attendance and get people excited.</p> \n<p>Engagement ads use social proof to determine where users are more likely to pay attention to, and be interested in, an ad after seeing how others interact with it.</p> \n<p>Take yourself for example — would you spend more time considering an ad with 473 likes or an ad with 14 likes? I’ll take the former, please.</p> \n<p>When others engage with your ads, their activity will also be shared with their Facebook friends, reaching even more people. Their validation will help your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/how-online-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-changing?_ga=2.216279574.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">online word-of-mouth marketing</a>.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to establish brand credibility through likes, comments, and shares and increase interaction with your business on Facebook.</p> \n<h3>5. App Installs</h3> \n<p>This objective helps drive mobile app installs by taking users directly to the App Store or Google Play store to download your app. Facebook shows these ads to members of your target audience who have previously downloaded apps from ads to increase chances of your app installations.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose app installs ads to increase app downloads for your business.</p> \n<h3>6. Video Views</h3> \n<p>Facebook will push video views ads to your target audience with the objective of getting as many views as possible. These ads can be a powerful way to tell your brand story or show your service in an engaging and consumable. After all, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-trends-global-preferences?_ga=2.216279574.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">a HubSpot report</a> found that over 50% of consumers want to see video content from brands.</p> \n<p>What’s really valuable about video view ads is their ability to help you retarget those who watched your video. You can retarget people who watched your video content to remind them of your brand and product/service in hopes of boosting brand awareness and conversions.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to use video to share information about your business and reach your audience via an engaging medium. Then, retarget your viewers to boost chances of conversion.</p> \n<h3>7. Lead Generation</h3> \n<p>Lead generation ads are a great way to embed <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creating-lead-generation-offers-from-blogs?_ga=2.13713847.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">lead magnets</a> and collect leads while allowing the user to stay on Facebook. Users submit their personal information in exchange for an offer created by your business, such as an email newsletter or workbook.</p> \n<p>The ability for the user to remain on Facebook is a huge advantage for this type of ad. This makes it easy for the user to fill in the ad’s form, while never leaving the page or straying too far from what it is they originally went to the platform for — this results in a seamless UX and can increase chances of conversion.</p> \n<p>Facebook can even auto-fill these forms by pulling contact information from the user’s account details so all they have to do is click \"Submit”.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to collect leads for your business with an enticing offer. This works best when the user is already in the consideration stage of their buyer’s journey and is therefore willing to exchange their information for something of value in return.</p> \n<h3>8. Messages</h3> \n<p>With the messages objective, viewers can directly message your business through the ad using <a href=\"https://www.messenger.com/\">Facebook Messenger</a>.</p> \n<p>This is an effective way to personally connect with users to generate more interest in your business. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/tips-for-connecting-with-your-prospects-on-facebook?_ga=2.13713847.1083519983.1595599444-826779246.1592840265\">Engaging with your audience through Messenger</a> allows you to connect with your audience versus talking <em>at </em>them.</p> \n<p>Leverage your conversations as an opportunity to answer any questions, offer customer support, build rapport with your audience, collect leads, and drive sales. Messenger is a great way to show your customers that there’s a human on the other end, ready to help them.</p> \n<p>With these ads, it’s crucial that you’re ready to respond quickly and effectively once the messages flow in. Otherwise, prospective customers may lose interest if you’re not responsive to their inquiries.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to encourage users to contact your business through Facebook Messenger, if you’re prepared to respond in a timely manner.</p> \n<h2>Conversion Facebook Campaign Objectives</h2> \n<p>Conversion objectives nudge audiences to buy or use your product or service.</p> \n<h3>9. Conversions</h3> \n<p>The goal of conversion ads is to encourage people to take valuable actions on your website or app, such as registering for an event, adding an item to cart, or making a purchase.</p> \n<p>These ads are most successful when delivered to people who are already familiar with your product — likely, those who have gone through the awareness and consideration stages and need an extra push toward conversion.</p> \n<p>Installing the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel\">Facebook pixel</a> on your website will be required for these ads to help Facebook optimize your campaigns. The pixel is a piece of code for your site that tracks each time a user takes action and converts through a Facebook ad. With each conversion, Facebook learns who to target in the ads to maximize conversions.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad to increase conversion actions on your site or app. These ads should be served to those who are already knowledgeable about your business.</p> \n<h3>10. Catalog Sales</h3> \n<p>The catalog sales ad is made with a holistic view of ecommerce stores in mind. Instead of promoting a single product or service, ads with this objective will show relevant products from your store to people who have demonstrated interest in them before. Facebook is able to recognize this behavior based on its understanding of your offerings and the user through its pixel.</p> \n<p>These ads require you to integrate your product catalog with Facebook so the platform can pull a selection from your store and adjust it as needed for audience members based on various factors, such as your latest arrivals.</p> \n<p>Catalog sales ads are also more specific than conversion ads because the end goal is to generate sales, whereas the goal of conversions ads can vary from increasing registration or adding payment information.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad if you prefer Facebook select which products from your catalog are most relevant for your audience, based on their <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/top-tips-to-machine-learning\">machine learning</a> predictions, in order to increase sales.</p> \n<h3>11. Store Traffic</h3> \n<p>The store traffic objective is perfect for businesses with physical locations as the goal is to remove the digital barrier and bring in-person foot traffic to your store.</p> \n<p>The ads are delivered to people who are physically near your store, so they are more likely to visit. It’s important to mention these ads target based on location only, which means audience demographics will not be considered.</p> \n<p>There are two necessities for store traffic ads to work. As the advertiser, you must ensure that all your business locations are properly entered in <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\">Business Manager</a>. For the consumer, their location services must be enabled so Facebook knows when to show the ad.</p> \n<p>With those stars aligned, you’ll be able to track your store visits at each location from the ad.</p> \n<p>TLDR: Choose this ad if your business has brick and mortar locations and you’re looking to increase store visits.</p> \n<p>Now, when you log into <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager\">Facebook Ads Manager</a>, you should have a better idea what all the campaign objectives mean.

Perhaps how-to posts are your forte. Or maybe you just can't resist the list. But just because you have a signature format, doesn't mean it's necessarily<em> right</em> for the topic you're blogging about.</p> \n<p>Aah ... decisions, decisions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It's okay though! We're here to help you through it. So in this post, I'm going to break down some of the most popular blog post types and formats to help you determine which one is right for the blog idea you've got milling around in that head of yours.</p> \n<p>That said, keep in mind that some posts may even straddle two or more formats. I've written thought leadership posts that could also probably be classified as list posts. And if I'd added a SlideShare to them? They would've straddled three!&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The point is to recognize that there isn't just one type of blog post you can create -- and some formats are much more suitable for certain ideas than others. Another thing to consider is that a lot of times, it will all boil down to the angle you take on a topic. For example, if I wanted to write a post about social media, there is probably a different angle I could take that would work for each of the following formats. It will all depend on the angle I decide to take.</p> \n<p></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Blog Post Types and Formats</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>The How-To Post</li> \n  <li>The Listicle</li> \n  <li>The Curated Post</li> \n  <li>The Thought Leadership Post</li> \n  <li>The Fun Post</li> \n  <li>The 'What' Post</li> \n  <li>The 'Why' Post</li> \n  <li>The Feature Story</li> \n  <li>The FAQ Post</li> \n  <li>The Interview Post</li> \n  <li>The SlideShare Post</li> \n  <li>The Infographic Post</li> \n  <li>The Newsjack</li> \n  <li>The Comparison Post</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3><strong>1. The How-To Post</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format: </strong>Step-by-step guide that tells your readers how to do something.</em>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-blog-post.jpg?width=600&amp;name=how-to-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"example of a how-to blog post format that has the title &quot;how to write an email signature&quot; with the steps displayed underneath it\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>This is one of the most common blog post formats for business bloggers. It makes perfect sense, considering how-to posts are inherently educational and great for generating traffic from organic search. Use how-to posts when your topic has to do with educating your audience about how to do something they might not know how to do.</p> \n<p>Oftentimes, how-to posts can also be strengthened by supporting visual components for concepts that lend themselves to visual explanations, like an instructional video or a visual aid.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?hubs_post-cta=inline&amp;_ga=2.205173456.1791040395.1555933654-1307414301.1541080541\">Download a Free&nbsp;How-To Blog Post Template Here</a></h3> \n<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/professional-email-signatures\">How to Write a Great Email Signature [+ Professional Examples]</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-social-media-report\">How to Create a Social Media Report [Free Template]</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\">How to Write a Blog Post: A Step-by-Step Guide [+ Free Blog Post Templates]</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>2. The Listicle</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format: </strong>List of similar items or content.&nbsp;</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/listicle-blog-post.jpg?width=600&amp;name=listicle-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"example of a listicle blog post with the title of the list &quot;interactive blog post examples&quot; and list items beneath it\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Another very popular blog post format, the list post (commonly referred to as a \"listicle\"), is characterized by content organized in a list. List posts are easily recognizable by their titles, since they usually include a number in headline, and they're great formats for beginner bloggers since they're very formulaic. Unfortunately, it's for this reason that listicles have gotten a bad rap, and are often perceived as low quality pieces of content ... probably because there&nbsp;<em>are indeed&nbsp;</em>a lot of crappy list posts out there.</p> \n<p>But when done right, lists posts are great for posts that seek to aggregate tips, tactics, or ideas under a certain topic, and they <em>can</em>&nbsp;result in high-quality content. Plus, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/9-reasons-you-cant-resist-list\">people love 'em</a>!&nbsp;To learn about how to create a high-quality list post,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32105/The-Top-10-Qualities-of-High-Quality-List-Posts.aspx\">check out this post</a>. <em>(Bonus: It also happens to be a great example of a list post in and of itself, in addition to the few below.)</em></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?hubs_post-cta=inline&amp;_ga=2.239777475.1791040395.1555933654-1307414301.1541080541\">Download a Free&nbsp;Listicle Blog Post Template Here</a></h3> \n<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/interactive-blog-post\">10 Ways to Make Your Blog Post Interactive</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-calendar-tools\">10 Social Media Calendars, Tools, &amp; Templates to Plan Your Content</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-techniques\">12 of the Best Marketing Techniques for 2020</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>3. The Curated Post&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format: </strong>Highlights and curates (usually external) content around a certain theme.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/curated-blog-post.gif?width=1321&amp;name=curated-blog-post.gif\" alt=\"example of a curated blog post that has compiled a list of ted talks with embedded video\" width=\"1321\" style=\"width: 1321px;\">Another post that has historically (yet undeservingly) gotten a bad rap is the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6800/A-Marketer-s-Guide-to-Content-Curation.aspx\">curated post</a>. Although it's sometimes perceived as lazy and unoriginal, curated content can actually be extremely helpful to readers, since the research component of them can be very time consuming, and the end result is a compilation of helpful resources all in one place.</p> \n<p>The curated post is ideal for aggregating content such as industry examples, statistics, quotations, and videos -- <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/19044/10-Great-Ideas-for-Valuable-Curated-Content.aspx\">among other things</a>. It's also great for building relationships with the other bloggers and businesses you highlight within your curated content.</p> \n<h4><strong style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/15-phenomenal-ted-talks\">15 Phenomenal TED Talks You Need to Watch Today</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/messaging-app-stats\">43 Messaging App Stats That Marketers Should Know</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34006/15-Examples-of-Brilliant-Homepage-Design.aspx\">15 Examples of Brilliant Homepage Design</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>4. The Thought Leadership Post&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format: </strong>Original data or opinions intended to make the reader think.</em></p> \n<p><em><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/thought-leadership-blog-post.jpg?width=600&amp;name=thought-leadership-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"example of a thought leadership post that includes original data from an experiment along with a section titled &quot;what we learned&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></em></p> \n<p>One of the more difficult types of posts to write, thought leadership-style posts usually take the form of pontification about things like where the industry is headed or industry trends that seem to be emerging and what they mean.</p> \n<p>For this reason, they're not really the type of post you can just decide to write at the drop of a hat, like, \"I'm going to write a thought leadership post today!\" Rather, they're usually the result of thoughtful examination of things you've noticed or have been thinking about over time, and they tend to be speculative and sometimes controversial in nature. They also tend to spark some great discussions!</p> \n<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/predictive-seo-hubspot\">Predictive SEO: How HubSpot Saves Traffic We Haven't Lost Yet</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-b2c-marketing\">Can B2C Marketing Succeed on LinkedIn?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sprint-planning-marketing-hubspot\">How Our Marketing Team Used Sprint Planning While Working Remotely</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>5.

Content whose main purpose is to entertain <em>does</em> have a place in your content mix, and it can be very refreshing to your audience -- as long as it's in moderation.</p> \n<p>These types of posts are great for publishing during holidays, the end of the day, the end of the week, and other times when your audience is burnt out, winding down, or could use a break from some of the more, um, <em>intellectual</em> content on the web. Just make sure you stay true to the focus of your blog overall by ensuring the concept of your fun post has a relevant tie-in. For more on the benefits of entertaining content, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/why-publish-content-entertainment-value\">here's why you should publish content for entertainment value alone</a> every once in a while.</p> \n<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/the-12-best-sales-movies-of-all-time-list\">The 20 Best Sales Movies of All Time [Updated for 2020]</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/funny-weird-interview-questions\">15 Fun, Weird, &amp; Unexpected Interview Questions (With Sample Answers)</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/funniest-social-media-tweets\">26 of the Funniest Tweets About Social Media We've Ever Seen</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>6. The 'What' Post</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format: </strong>Explanation of a concept.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/what-blog-post.jpg?width=600&amp;name=what-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"example of a what blog post with the title of a concept &quot;purpose of marketing&quot; along with an explanation of that concept underneath\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>The 'what' post is perfect for introductory-style content geared toward a beginner audience. In general, the 'what' post serves to introduce and explain a concept, whether it be an industry trend, tactic, or tool; and it typically highlights what it is and why you should care. Linking to or including a call-to-action for more in-depth, intermediate content (like an ebook or another blog post) about the topic at the end of the post is a great best practice for 'what' posts.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?hubs_post-cta=inline&amp;_ga=2.239777475.1791040395.1555933654-1307414301.1541080541\">Download a Free&nbsp;\"What Is\" Blog Post Template Here</a></h3> \n<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33894/what-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx\">What Is Context Marketing, and Why It Matters [Quick Guide]</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog\">What Is a Blog, &amp; Why Should You Create One</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-marketing\">What is the Purpose of Marketing?

The 'Why' Post&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format: </strong>Explanation of why a concept is important.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/why-blog-post.gif?width=600&amp;name=why-blog-post.gif\" alt=\"example of a why blog post that relies heavily on statistics to make a point\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>These posts are great when you're trying to call attention to and emphasize the importance or significance of a certain topic, whether it be a trend, a tool, or a concept in general. Given their nature, these types of posts tend to be pretty introductory as well. In these posts, it's smart to back up your <em>why</em>&nbsp;argument with supporting examples, facts, and statistics that will help convince the reader the topic is something they should care about. Think about it as something of a persuasive article.</p> \n<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/user-generated-content-stats\">Why Marketers Should Implement User-Generated Content: 23 Stats to Know</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/make-data-more-human\">Why HubSpot's Director of Analytics Wants You to Make Data More Human</a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/why-publish-content-entertainment-value\"><br></a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/why-purchasing-email-lists-is-always-a-bad-idea.aspx\">Why Buying Email Lists Is Always a Bad Idea (And How to Build Yours for Free)</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>8. The Feature Story</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format:</strong> Mimicks the style of a human interest story, detailing concepts and ideas of specific market interest.</em></p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/feature-story-blog-post.gif?width=1321&amp;name=feature-story-blog-post.gif\" alt=\"example of a feature story post that provides commentary on a trend\" width=\"1321\" style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px; font-family: AvenirNext, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; width: 1321px;\"> \n<p>This type of post is great for topics, people, or trends that are worth more in-depth, detailed research and commentary. One of the more journalistic types of blog posts, these articles tend to be hard to define in a blanket statement and more of a \"you'll know it when you see it\" kind of post.</p> \n<h4><strong>Examples:&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-data-download\">I Downloaded My Facebook Data and It Got Weird Fast</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lessons-from-remote-week\">HubSpot’s Marketing Team Worked Remotely for One Week.

The FAQ Post&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format:</strong> Question and answer (Q&amp;A) format.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/faq-blog-post.jpg?width=600&amp;name=faq-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"example of an faq blog post that contains multiple questions about seo and their answers\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>The FAQ post is another format that's great for beginner bloggers, considering the Q&amp;A format is a built in template. These posts are great for addressing common questions your audience has, grouped under a specific topic.</p> \n<p>A great way to generate posts like these is to ask your sales and services departments -- the people who are talking to prospective and current customers all the time -- to write down any common questions they hear. You can also collect questions you get from blog and social media commentary, as well as attendee questions during webinars. These questions are great fodder for Q&amp;A type posts, and as a result, they can become great <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33797/13-Types-of-Product-Content-Sales-Needs-to-Close-More-Deals.aspx\">resources for your sales and services teams</a> as well.</p> \n<h4><strong>Examples:&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-seo\">The Definition of SEO in 100 Words or Less [FAQs]</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-faqs-list-ht\">Answers to 18 SEO Questions You Were Too Afraid to Ask</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33466/answers-to-the-19-most-frequently-asked-questions-about-a-b-testing.aspx\">Answers to the 19 Most Frequently Asked Questions About A/B Testing</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>10. The Interview Post&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format: </strong>Quoted perspectives of a third party. May also manifest in Q&amp;A format.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/interview-blog-post.jpg?width=1027&amp;name=interview-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"example of an interview blog post with a stylized quote from the interviewee\" width=\"1027\" style=\"width: 1027px;\">Similar to Q&amp;A formatted posts -- since these posts may also be formatted as Q&amp;As -- is the interview post. Fantastic for introducing the perspective of a third party on a particular topic, interview posts are also great for developing relationships with the industry experts or influencers you interview. They also open up the opportunity for greater reach, especially if the interviewee shares the resulting post with their networks.<em><br></em></p> \n<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rise-above-marketing-mediocrity\">How to Rise Above Marketing Mediocrity, According to Ann Handley</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/affordable-ai\">How to Implement Affordable AI in 3 Steps, According to the Marketing AI Institute Director</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/trends-according-social-media-professor\">2020 Social Media Trends, According to HubSpot's Social Media Professor</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>11. The SlideShare Post</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>Format: </strong>Features an embedded SlideShare presentation.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/slideshare-blog-post.gif?width=600&amp;name=slideshare-blog-post.gif\" alt=\"example of a slideshare blog post with the hubspot culture code slide deck\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Posts that are built around a specific <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/11137/10-Ways-To-Become-a-SlideShare-Marketing-Master.aspx\">SlideShare presentation</a> do require a little bit more time investment and design savvy than the average text-based post, but the results are usually worth it. Content that lends itself well (but isn't limited) to SlideShare presentations include the curation of visual examples, quotes, charts, quick takeaways, and general storytelling. SlideShare-focused posts also make great social media fodder, since <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33800/Photos-on-Facebook-Generate-53-More-Likes-Than-the-Average-Post-NEW-DATA.aspx\">visual content is so shareable and social friendly</a>&nbsp;<em>(Hint: LinkedIn also owns SlideShare ;-) )</em></p> \n<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx\">The HubSpot Culture Code: Creating a Company We Love</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hidden-linkedin-hacks-revealed-slideshare\">21 Hidden LinkedIn Hacks Revealed [SlideShare]</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/10-best-storytellers\">10 of the World's Best Storytellers [SlideShare]</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><strong>12.

And, since we usually backup and save our data on auto-pilot, we might not realize just how much has been re-copied and re-saved, time and time again.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, over time, our data storage becomes unnecessarily burdened with redundant copies of data -- this could cost your company money, as data requirements become larger, or time, as processing time becomes slower.</p> \n<p>This is where data deduplication comes in.<br></p> \n<p>Andrew Le, an IT Helpdesk Technician at HubSpot, further explains the importance of data deduplication for a business looking to grow -- \"[Data deduplication] really improves scaling and efficiency when pulling data from one source. If you have lots of the same data in different spaces, your entire system can be slowed down.\"</p> \n<p>So, you might be wondering, <em>\"How does this work?\"</em> Let's dive into it below.</p> \n<h2>How does data deduplication work?</h2> \n<p>The data deduplication process might seem intimidating, but it's actually a simple process.</p> \n<p>You can use data deduplication software when you backup your computer. Additionally, some marketing automation software, like HubSpot, might have a deduplication feature to keep track of your marketing contacts.</p> \n<p>To ensure you're optimizing your data backup storage, we've cultivated a list of the best data deduplication software you can use to minimize unnecessary data copies, today.</p> \n<h2><strong>Examples of Data Deduplication Software</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/contacts/deduplication-of-contacts-companies-deals-tickets?_ga=2.176575980.81589904.1554671928-644648569.1551722047\">HubSpot's Deduplication Feature</a></h3> \n<p>If you use HubSpot's CRM to manage your contacts, you'll be impressed to find out you can also use HubSpot's machine learning-powered deduplication feature to keep your contact database clean. HubSpot contacts can be deduplicated by a user token set with a cookie in their web browser or email address -- additionally, contacts, companies, deals, and tickets can be deduplicated using a unique object ID.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.barracuda.com/resources/Barracuda_Backup_WP_Deduplication\">Barracuda Backup Deduplication</a></h3> \n<p>With a 9.1 user rating out of 10 on <a href=\"https://www.trustradius.com/products/barracuda-backup/reviews\">TrustRadius</a>, Barracuda Backup is a good option, offering a robust, secure, fully-integrated data deduplication solution. Their tool can help your business reduce bandwidth requirements and backup costs. Additionally, Barracuda is a good option if your business needs to protect multiple sites, since its cloud storage technology helps distributed networks stay protected.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/data-protection/avamar.htm#accordion0\">Avamar</a></h3> \n<p>Avamar, a solution from Dell EMC, provides variable-length deduplication, which reduces backup time by only storing unique daily changes while simultaneously maintaining daily backups. Avamar is an efficient, secure option and is particularly useful for virtual environments, remote offices, and enterprise applications.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://buy.hpe.com/b2c/us/en/storage/disk-storage-systems/storeonce-systems/storeonce-systems/hpe-storeonce-systems/p/5196525\">HPE StoreOnce</a></h3> \n<p>HPE StoreOnce, a solution from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, offers disk-based backup, deduplication, and secure long-term data storage. Their deduplication software is equipped for virtual backup machines in small remote offices, and equally capable of handling high-performance dedicated applications for larger businesses. Ultimately, this is an impressive tool to help you keep your data secure and efficient as you scale-up.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://exagrid.com/exagrid-products/product-architecture/\">Exagrid EX Series</a></h3> \n<p>Exagrid implements a highly efficient approach to data deduplicaton that allows six times the backup performance, and up to 20 times the restore and VM boot performance. With Exagrid, you can backup your data straight onto a disk without inline deduplication processing, enabling a shorter backup window.</p> \n<p>If your company stores a lot of data, it's important to begin the data deduplication process. By using software, you can simply automate this process.</p> \n<p style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdata-deduplication&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4f5256bb04b3a5f3f4d5776a29c900e7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdata-deduplication&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn70@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-23-021_2adf3bddfac19183.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336428},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Managing Remote Marketing Teams","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/managing-remote-marketing-teams","description":"<p>Behind many great teams are great managers.</p>  \n<p>Take my manager for example. Each day, she oversees a team of blog writers and editors, reports on the HubSpot Blog's progress to stakeholders, and also manages many of the logistics and processes that keep our site running smoothly.</p> \n<p>But, the blog's editorial processes and traffic strategies aren't the only things she focuses on. Most importantly, she takes time to empower each individual on our team. She mentors us as we lead projects that benefit the blog, plans team bonding activities, ensures that we're getting the tools and training we need to do our jobs, and checks in with us regularly to make sure the work we're doing is fulfilling.</p> \n<p>It sounds like she does a lot, right? And the kicker? Half of the team she manages, mentors, and empowers isn't even based in HubSpot's Cambridge office.</p> \n<p>By this point, you might know that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/management\">managing a team</a>, even isolated to one office, isn't for everyone. On any given day, you need to balance your own workload, overall team success strategies, and working with individuals within your department. To do this, you must balance being a team player and a leader. You also must be highly organized, strategic, and have a high level of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/emotional-intelligence\">emotional intelligence</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In a company that's primarily in-office, a manager can directly impact the success of their team. But, this role is even more important when it oversees a fully or partially remote team.</p> \n<p>Why? When your team is widely dispersed, a manager is tasked with bringing together their employees and giving them the tools to work well together. In times of confusion, questions, or ambiguity related to remote work styles, the manager is expected to make calls or answer critical questions.</p> \n<p>As the manager of a remote team, you need all the skills of an in-office manager -- and more. Not only do you need to be tactical and organized, but you also need to take extra time to make sure that colleagues feel in the loop, included, and like they can succeed at your company. This takes added time, much more communication, and a strong sense of inclusion and empathy.</p> \n<p>Whether you're a new or experienced manager, moving from leading an in-office to a dispersed team can be a major transition. To help you, I've compiled a guide of 10 tips for remote team management. These tips relate to logistically planning your remote team's processes, building an inclusive culture, and using emotional intelligence as a team leader.</p> \n<h2>How to Effectively Manage Remote Teams</h2> \n<h3>Creating Processes Around Remote Work</h3> \n<h4>1. Create an effective remote hiring and onboarding process.</h4> \n<p>Before you can manage a remote team, you'll need to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/recruitment\">hire</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/onboarding-remote-customer-support\">onboard</a> your talent.</p> \n<p>To get started, use digital platforms such as Indeed or LinkedIn to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/recruitment\">announce and promote your new job position</a>. Be sure to note that the position can be held remotely in any location. This descriptive language will make it easier for prospective candidates to find your listings via search engines, as well as your own promotions.</p> \n<p>Our managers have seen that one of the best ways to interview and evaluate a remote candidate is through a virtual hiring process. While this process could include video interviews with hiring managers and the candidate, it could also include other steps such as a writing test to evaluate a candidate's writing or other virtual tasks that allow a candidate to show off their level of skill in a given area.</p> \n<p>If you can accept candidates in different locations and timezones, you should also take steps to accommodate them in the hiring process. This could include hosting an interview during their work hours.</p> \n<p>When you interview remote talent, you'll also want to put any judgments related to a candidate's location aside and interview them in their natural work environment.</p> \n<p>Additionally, \"If you’re hiring for a position that is open to being remote or in office, conduct all interviews via video call to avoid any location biases in your hiring panel,\" says HubSpot Marketing, Sales, and Service Managing Editor Meg Prater.</p> \n<p>After you complete the hiring process, you'll want to welcome your new hire with a smooth virtual <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/onboarding-remote-customer-support\">onboarding process</a> that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/onboarding-process\">teaches how the company works</a> while allowing them to get to know their teammates remotely.</p> \n<p>As you prepare an onboarding process for a remote employee, identify ways that you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/onboarding-remote-customer-support\">digitize your current onboarding process</a>. For example, if there are documents or resources an employee should read up on, make sure they are in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/onboarding-remote-customer-support\">a PDF, Google Doc, or online format</a>. You might also want to create an internal training website, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/onboarding-remote-customer-support\">or knowledge base</a>, where employees can find these documents even after they've completed a new-hire orientation.</p> \n<p>If there's an aspect of your onboarding that is too complex for a PDF format, consider doing a virtual training session where you walk your employee through various tasks. This will allow them to see a demonstration of a process they'll do first-hand and ask you questions about it as they learn.</p> \n<p>On the HubSpot Blog team, each employee's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/onboarding-process\">onboarding process</a> lasts roughly 100 days and can be fully virtual. During this process, remote employees receive virtual training sessions, links to blog posts, and digital resources that relate to their role, self-paced mini-online courses that familiarize them with our software, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tips\">informal virtual coffee chats</a> which allow the new employee to get to know colleagues.</p> \n<p>On top of virtual onboarding, every employee has regular check-ins, career chats, and ongoing training with his or her supervisor to ensure that they're progressing in their role.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the goal any manager should have when <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/onboarding-process\">onboarding</a> remote employees is to make them feel supported, informed about how their company works, and more confident in their new role.</p> \n<p>To start an employee off on the right foot, think about your current onboarding processes and where they can be improved to add more communication and decrease confusion. Then, determine how you can make these processes virtual.</p> \n<p>As you identify elements of the onboarding process that can be made virtual, create an outline for your process. Then, to help you refine or improve on this process, ask new remote employees who undergo it for feedback at the end of their first few months. This will give you an idea of what's working and what needs to be improved.</p> \n<p>To learn more about the logistics behind onboarding, the paperwork you'll need to have your employee filled out, and the things you can do to make their experience feel welcoming, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/onboarding-process\">this detailed onboarding checklist</a>.

Schedule and run effective virtual team meetings.</h4> \n<p>When you or your team members are remote, team meetings will be a crucial means of communication. Not only do they allow you to all join on one video call to talk about projects or goals, but they also enable teammates to get to know each other and stay visible.</p> \n<p><strong>Determining Which Meetings You Need</strong></p> \n<p>When you have a remote or global team, you'll want to have at least one fairly regular meeting to regroup and get on the same page. For example, you might want a monthly meeting with your team and other stakeholders to discuss team performance and goals, and a weekly standup meeting to learn what your immediate team is doing.</p> \n<p>\"Conduct a weekly standup meeting for everyone on your team to be together in the same virtual room,\" advises Prater. \"It’s important to have that face-to-face time each week.\"</p> \n<p>\"Our team starts by giving a one-word overview of how they’re feeling, followed by an ice breaker, a roundup of what everyone’s working on, and then a discussion article provided by a different member of the team each week.\" Prater shares.</p> \n<p><strong>Preparing for a Virtual Meeting</strong></p> \n<p>If you haven't already, you'll want to designate a meeting software, such as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tools\">Zoom or GoToMeeting</a> based on your needs, budget, and how large your virtual meeting will be. Then, you'll want to make sure that all of your team members have the program on their computers.</p> \n<p>When you're ready to schedule the meeting, be sure to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-meetings-tips\">pick a time that works for team members in different timezones</a>. Stick to this meeting time and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-meetings-tips\">avoid canceling</a> to ensure that remote employees who didn't get a cancellation notice don't tune in.</p> \n<p>Send an email and calendar invitation to your team explaining why you've decided to hold the meeting and what they should do to prepare for it. You'll also want to include meeting login information or a number they can call into if they aren't near a computer.</p> \n<p>If you'd like employees other than yourself to present at the meeting, it can also be helpful to create a slide deck ahead of time so each teammate asked to speak can submit and get their slides approved by you beforehand.</p> \n<p>Allowing teammates to submit slides beforehand will help you ensure that each teammate will give the most valuable information to other remote employees in the time they have to present. Using one slide deck will also limit any issues related to switching screen-shares during the meeting.</p> \n<p><strong>Running the Meeting</strong></p> \n<p>Just before you launch the meeting, make sure that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-meetings-tips\">your computer's sound and video</a> are working and that you have a work-appropriate background. You should also ensure that the environment around you is quiet and not distracting to your teammates.</p> \n<p>Once you launch the meeting, wait a minute or two before starting the discussion, just in case other remote employees are running late from another virtual meeting. During this time, feel free to mingle with teammates and get to know them.</p> \n<p>If you have colleagues that can't attend the meeting, plan to record it. This way, someone who wasn't available or had technical difficulties can listen to the meeting discussion after to stay in the loop.</p> \n<p>If the meeting includes a small group of people or a new employee, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-meetings-tips\">leave time in the beginning for everyone to introduce themselves</a> and give a brief description of what they do at your company.</p> \n<p>You can also consider a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-meetings-tips\">quick virtual ice-breaker</a>. As Prater mentioned above, this is something that the blog team has embraced in our weekly meetings.</p> \n<p>\"Ice breakers might sound cringe-worthy, but they single-handedly transformed our meetings from transactional run-downs of everyone’s to-list to a fun, personal opportunity to get to know our teammates a little better,\" Prater says.</p> \n<p><strong>Wrapping Up the Meeting</strong></p> \n<p>At the end of the meeting, leave time for questions. If you have some in-office employees and some remote employees, it can be helpful to invite remote employees to ask questions first to avoid teams accidentally speaking over each other.</p> \n<p>Then, send the slide deck and meeting recording link to your team so they can reference these resources later on.</p> \n<p><strong>Refining Your Meeting Schedule</strong></p> \n<p>As you start to run multiple virtual meetings, Nataly Kelly, HubSpot's VP of Localization, says you should continue to evaluate their effectiveness.</p> \n<p>After each meeting, Kelly says you should try to answer questions like, \"Are the right people in the meeting?\", \"Is this the right frequency for meetings?\", \"Is the meeting too long or too short?\", and \"Is this the best use of everyone's time?\"</p> \n<p>\"Often, you only need to change one variable to make things work better for a remote team,\" Kelly says.</p> \n<p>While it might be tempting to book your team with tons of virtual meetings to stay on the same page, Kelly instead advises that you leave team members with some flexible calendar space each week.</p> \n<p>\"Make sure you're not filling your calendar with eight hours of video calls per day. Encourage your team to block time to work on other projects,\" Kelly adds. \"Or, if the team lends itself to it, consider doing most of your meetings in the mornings and leaving afternoons for other work. Just make sure you give people time in their day that is unscheduled.\"</p> \n<p>To learn more about scheduling an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-meetings-tips\">effective virtual team meeting</a>, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-meetings-tips\">this list of tips</a> and strategies.</p> \n<h4>3. Check-in with individuals on your team regularly.</h4> \n<p>When you or your teammate is working remotely, you can't easily turn to them to ask them a question, get to know them, or have a casual work conversation. This is why, on top of your roster of remote meetings, you should also consider booking one-on-ones or informal virtual coffee chats with people you don't often see daily.</p> \n<p>This will allow you to keep up with your employees, discuss their work with them, help them with any blockers they might be facing, and offer visibility so they can feel like you're an accessible manager.</p> \n<p>Aside from discussing work with each employee, Prater says you should also schedule times to discuss your employee's career growth and progress.</p> \n<p>\"The biggest worry I hear from remote folks or those being managed by a remote manager is that they won’t have the same opportunities for advancement,\" says Prater. \"I over-communicate when it comes to career growth.\"</p> \n<p>\"I have weekly check-ins with each of my direct reports where we talk about what they’re working on. But I also schedule quarterly career chats where I draw up a personalized growth plan for each of them, and we run through prompts to check their satisfaction in their current role and their aspirations for what’s next,\" Prater explains.</p> \n<p>Aside from scheduled one-on-ones, you should also consider leaving some areas of flexible time on your calendar. This way, if a remote colleague has a question or concern that's easier to discuss in person than via text-based message, you're able to quickly jump on a call.</p> \n<p>\"Be ready to jump on a phone call or video conference without having to schedule a time for it,\" advises,\" Susanne Ronnqvist Ahmadi, HubSpot's VP of International Marketing advises. \"Let your team know you're available over your instant messaging software and build “air-time” into your calendar for check-ins and quick talks.\"</p> \n<h4>4. Embrace and implement digital productivity tools.</h4> \n<p>On top of video call software, there are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tools\">many helpful tools</a> that you can use to manage remote or dispersed teams. Here just a few types of tools you should consider implementing:</p> \n<p><strong>Scheduling Tools</strong></p> \n<p>When everyone is remote, having an email or Slack discussion just to determine a good time for a meeting can be redundant and non-productive. Luckily, there are plenty of tools that allow you to request, manage, and schedule meetings with your team.</p> \n<p>For example, if you have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tools\">Microsoft Outlook or GSuite</a>, you can see your teammate's calendars, working hours, and availability. Then, you can send a meeting invite for a time that they're free. From there, your teammate can accept, reject, or suggest a new time for an event.</p> \n<p><strong>Task Management Systems</strong></p> \n<p>With a task management system <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tools\">like Trello or Asana</a>, you can create a joint team project and assign different team members to tasks virtually. You can also give tasks deadlines and check to see if they're been marked as completed.</p> \n<p><strong>Instant Messengers</strong></p> \n<p>Ever got caught up in a giant email thread where multiple people were replying to the same message? An <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tools\">instant messaging app</a>, such as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tools\">Slack</a>, will allow you to create group threads to discuss projects, upload assets within the conversation, and see when other team members have replied clearly. This is also a helpful way to communicate with your team about topics that don't require a full video call to discuss.</p> \n<p>Aside from quick conversations, you can also host mini-meetings on your instant messaging platform. For example, the HubSpot Blog has a weekly meeting where we submit blog titles to a group chat and request feedback on them virtually. This takes little time and provides us with an opportunity to work with in-office and remote employees.</p> \n<p>To learn more about 35 remote work tools, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tools\">check out this detailed guide</a>.</p> \n<h4>5. Be mindful of timezones and remote employee boundaries.</h4> \n<p>Remote work options allow you to hire talent from every area of the world. This is a great way to boost the level of diverse thinking on your team and learn about different marketers.</p> \n<p>However, one challenge global teams face is adapting to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/teams-in-different-timezones\">teammates in different timezones</a>.</p> \n<p>As a remote team manager, it's important to navigate around your teammates' differing work hours, while also encouraging teammates in your timezone to be mindful of other remote teammate schedules.</p> \n<p>As you onboard employees or implement a team calendar, ask remote teammates to mark their working and non-working hours on their schedule. You can also have an intro conversation with teams to discuss timezones and preferred work hours, just to ensure that all team members are up to date with who will be working when.</p> \n<p>If a large chunk of your team is in another timezone, you might also want to consider <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/teams-in-different-timezones\">working on that timezone's schedule</a> one day a week or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/teams-in-different-timezones\">doing a split shift</a>, where you complete half of your work hours when one chunk of your team is most active and another do another shift when a team in another timezone is online. This strategy could help you be more available to your global teammates and stay in the loop of what they're up to.</p> \n<h4>6. Align with outside teams virtually.</h4> \n<p>At a company with remote or dispersed employees, you shouldn't just focus on your own team. You should also be sure to communicate regularly with other departments to see where your team's work can align with there's and where you can benefit the bigger business.</p> \n<p>One example of this is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-smarketing\">sales and marketing alignment</a>. While marketers aim to reach goals related to traffic and brand awareness, salespeople are focused purely on the bottom line. While both teams are vital for their businesses, they can get disjointed due to their differing success metrics. However, when these two teams work well together, marketers can hit their KPIs while also benefiting the company's overall sales.</p> \n<p>As a marketing manager, you should try to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-smarketing\">plan virtual chats with sales managers</a> and other teams to discuss goals and where your team can align with theirs. You can also use digital tools, like marketing attribution software, to get an idea of how your work impacts the greater company.</p> \n<p>In the long run, these meetings will allow you to think of the company with a broader scope rather than just focusing on your team's efforts all the time.</p> \n<h3>Creating an Inclusive Culture</h3> \n<h4>7. Take steps to ensure all teammates feel included.</h4> \n<p>Commonly, remote employees struggle with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-visibility\">feelings of disconnection and a lack of visibility</a>.</p> \n<p>Without an office filled with people, remote employees don't have the opportunity to make small talk with colleagues, ask questions, or have a quick work-related chat. This can leave them feeling unincluded or out of the loop on team projects. They might also worry that it will be hard to excel at their company if <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-visibility\">they aren't as visible as other employees</a>.</p> \n<p>To help each employee feel a sense of belonging, identify where you can make processes and group events more inclusive.</p> \n<p>\"We often remind managers that it truly is the little things that can make a difference in allowing a remote employee to feel included,\" says Siobhán McGinty, a Principle Marketing Manager.</p> \n<p>\"That feeling of inclusion can make such a difference to employee retention, happiness, and performance — so the little things actually matter quite a lot,\" McGinty adds. \"During the remote week, we heard lots of examples of how managers and teams go above and beyond in ensuring that their remote counterparts are included in the day-to-day.\"</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lessons-from-remote-week\">recent post</a> about the HubSpot marketing team's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lessons-from-remote-week\">experimental work-from-home week</a>, McGinty offered a list of actions that could make remote teammates feel more included. These could include sending e-birthday cards, inviting remote teammates to in-person get-togethers via video call, or organizing a virtual gift exchange around the holidays.</p> \n<p>Aside from making your remote employees feel included through simple actions, you can also schedule activities that allow them to offer ideas or work virtually with the rest of the broader team.</p> \n<p>For example, you could host a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brainstorm-productive\">campaign brainstorm</a> where all remote members are invited to share their ideas. Or, before you leave for the holidays, you could expense your team's dinners and host a virtual hack night where you work ahead to ensure the business still runs smoothly when everyone's on vacation.</p> \n<p>Not only do team bonding activities allow the team to work together, but they also allow remote members to feel included and get to know their colleagues.</p> \n<h4>8. Identify opportunities for virtual team bonding.</h4> \n<p>It can be easy to think that your team is bonding during business meetings and team celebrations. But, the truth is, your colleagues might only see each other during these times.</p> \n<p>To build an even better team, consider virtual opportunities that allow teammates to get to know each other on a more human level.</p> \n<p>Just the other day, my team took part in a virtual Pictionary-like game called <a href=\"https://www.drawasaurus.org/\">Drawasaurus</a>. While this meeting had nothing to do with work, it allowed us to chat, learn about each other, and have fun with teammates we don't get to see daily.</p> \n<p>If your schedule is incredibly limited, you can also make time for virtual bonding in regular team meetings. For example, as Prater, noted earlier each of our blog meetings begins with at least two icebreakers.</p> \n<p>Aside from enabling teammates to get to know each other during virtual events, you should also identify opportunities where you can get to know the individuals on your team more personally. For example, rather than scheduling a one-on-one to discuss only work with a remote employee, you could schedule a remote coffee chat that's just devoted to getting to know teammates.</p> \n<p>\"As with any relationship, time spent together is important. And if you're remote, that time naturally is more limited. As a result, building rapport is even more challenging,\" says Susanne Ronnqvist Ahmadi, HubSpot's VP of International Marketing.</p> \n<p>\"I try and make an effort in getting to know the people I'm working with to understand how we can best work together, communicate, and interact with each other,\" Ronnqvist Ahmadi explains.</p> \n<h3>Using Emotional Intelligence</h3> \n<h4>9. Encourage empathy among in-office and out-of-office teammates.</h4> \n<p>When it comes to remote work, some of the biggest challenges that employees face are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tips\">feelings of loneliness and disconnection</a>. They also find it <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-stats?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">hard to unplug at the end of the day</a> because their work is not clearly separated from their home life.</p> \n<p>As a remote team manager, it's important to recognize the challenges your employees might face and give them any other guidance when necessary. If you have any teammates who are in-office, you should also encourage them to consider the challenges a remote employee might go through on a regular basis.</p> \n<p>Recently, to help in-office employees understand the benefits and challenges of working from home, HubSpot asked the entire marketing department <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-stats?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">to remote for one week</a>. While some people really enjoyed the opportunity to work remotely, some struggled with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-stats?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\">staying focused, communicating with teammates, and finding an effective workspace</a>. Although the experiment only lasted for a week, it gave in-office employees a taste of the workstyles benefits and challenges.</p> \n<h4>10. Use emotional intelligence at all times.</h4> \n<p>While you might be calm and collected when managing a team in the office, overseeing remote teams might feel different to you emotionally. Even though you can't see a team and they can't see you, you should still use<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/emotional-intelligence\"> emotional intelligence</a> at all times.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/emotional-intelligence\">Emotional intelligence</a>, also called EQ, is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-future-marketing-workplace\">a sought after skill</a> that enables you to understand your emotions and train yourself to react in an appropriate way to certain scenarios.</p> \n<p>For example, when managing a remote team, you might need to resist the urge to mistrust or micromanage colleagues that you can't see every day.</p> \n<p>In this scenario, leaders that lack emotional intelligence might panic about their team going off-course and begin to control every aspect of everyone's work. Meanwhile, an emotionally intelligent leader might address this concern by scheduling check-ins with teammates to make sure a project is on the right track.</p> \n<p>\"Resist the temptation to micro-manage, even if you feel uncomfortable about having less visibility into the day-to-day,\" says Kelly. \"Autonomy and flexibility are hugely important for managing remotely.\"</p> \n<p>\"Keep your team focused on the critical goals, and don't worry about how they get there,\" Kelly adds/ \"Trust them to solve problems and make good decisions, but set a high bar to show you trust them to accomplish great things with the privilege of autonomy and flexibility.\"</p> \n<p>In another common team management scenario, you might find that your employee made a big mistake when you were offline.</p> \n<p>While a less emotionally intelligent leader might send a long ranting email, someone who understands their emotions will take a minute to note what frustrated them about a situation and then plan a chat to discuss constructive feedback with the employee.</p> \n<p>\"No angry emails,\" Kelly advises. \"Trust and respect matter hugely for remote teams to operate well, and because email is more important for remote teams, it's important to keep emotions out of it where possible.\"</p> \n<p>Kelly explains that email and other digital communication should be respectful and \"not a place for venting.\"</p> \n<p>Emotional intelligence can also help you in scenarios when there's a disagreement amongst your teammates, according to Kelly.</p> \n<p>\"When you sense someone is angry or disagrees with a decision on a remote team, jump on a call quickly to resolve it,\" Kelly says. \"Don't let things fester.</p> \n<p>\"Sometimes, the lack of face to face interaction makes it easier for people to jump to conclusions or feel misunderstood. It's important that you signal to your team that if they are upset or concerned, that you're there for them,\" Kelly advises.</p> \n<p>While you should use emotional intelligence to manage your own responses, you should also encourage your team to use the skill in their work life, too.</p> \n<p>For example, if you find that someone is inappropriately venting over a communication platform. \"make it clear what people should do instead.\" Alternatively, ask your teammates to schedule one-on-ones or send polite messages requesting a quick chat to discuss a situation.</p> \n<p>\"Give your team an option to vent about things that won't be disruptive to others, and importantly, won't lead to side chatter either,\" Kelly says.</p> \n<p>When you use emotional intelligence properly, your teammates will feel comfortable coming to you with questions and concerns more often. They'll also develop a stronger sense of trust in you as their manager. Ultimately, a manager who understands their emotions and the emotions of others can manage teams in a number of different scenarios.</p> \n<h2>Navigating Remote Work</h2> \n<p>If you've never worked remotely or managed remote teammates, it might take time to develop the perfect dispersed team management strategy.</p> \n<p>As you build up your management tactics, your most important goals should be to help the team to function smoothly, build an inclusive work culture that enables employees to succeed, and use emotional intelligence at all times. While building solid processes is key to ensuring work gets done, taking time to build a positive company culture will allow team members from every region to feel like they can contribute their diverse <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychological-safety-according-to-edmondson\">thoughts, ideas, and strategies</a>.</p> \n<p>Want to learn more about the remote work style?

In fact, in 2020, infographics were considered the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?_ga=2.257152651.1039809124.1597073295-631527517.1595282187&amp;hubs_signup-url=www.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing-statistics&amp;hubs_signup-cta=null\">third-most effective type of marketing content</a>, just behind blogging and video.<br></p> \n<p>But before you design&nbsp;an eye-catching infographic, you must first do the research to determine what story you’re going to tell, and how you’re going to tell it visually. And that research stage can be pretty tricky -- especially if you don’t have a plan.</p> \n<p>That why we put together a helpful guide that’ll walk you through how to conduct research for an infographic, without driving yourself crazy.</p> \n<h2>Why Marketers Should Use Infographics</h2> \n<p>There’s a reason infographics are such a popular form of content: Viewers love, engage with, and remember them.</p> \n<p>When people hear information, they're likely to remember only <a href=\"http://www.brainrules.net/vision\">10% of that information</a> three days later. Meanwhile, if a relevant image is paired with that same information, people retain <a href=\"http://www.brainrules.net/vision\">65% of it after the same timespan</a>.</p> \n<p>This is clearly a type of content your readers search&nbsp;for, so how do you make an infographic that’s informative, beautiful, and <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/anatomy-of-winning-infographic\">shareable</a>?</p> \n<p>Siege Media conducted a study on what makes infographics inherently shareable (the results of which they turned into a <a href=\"http://www.siegemedia.com/creation/infographics\">great infographic</a>&nbsp;of their own), and as it turns out, the most oft-shared infographics had an average of just 396 words.&nbsp;(For a point of reference, you’re almost 300 words into this article.)</p> \n<p>That’s some seriously effective storytelling, and if you want to craft a killer story, no matter what the content format, you have to do great research.</p> \n<p>You might think that all research is created equal, but there are specific tasks to ensure that you tell the right story for a graphical interpretation.</p> \n<p>Check out our list below for tips on how to begin your infographic design journey with a strong foundation of research.</p> \n<h2><span>How to Conduct Research for an Infographic</span></h2> \n<h3>1.

Leverage keyword research to find image SEO opportunities.</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve determined <i>who</i> will be searching for your infographic, you’ll want to figure out exactly <i>what</i> they’re searching for.</p> \n<p>In her article, HubSpot Customer Demand Manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelsprung\">Rachel Liest</a> explains <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">how to conduct keyword research</a>&nbsp;for SEO.</p> \n<p>Key to this process is starting with broad topics and potential search terms, then&nbsp;working your way to more specific terms using quantitative data.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://google.com\"><strong>Google Search: </strong></a>At the bottom of a Google search engine results page, a list of related popular search terms appears. Below is an example of my search for “blogging.” (Remember -- start with broad search terms.)</li> \n <li>Use the related search results to dig&nbsp;into the information your audience searches&nbsp;for so you can better tailor your infographic research.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blogging%20%20%20Google%20Search.png?width=254&amp;height=145&amp;name=blogging%20%20%20Google%20Search.png\" alt=\"blogging   Google Search.png\" width=\"254\" height=\"145\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends:</a></strong> This tool shows you how searches for a specific word or term have evolved over time. If searches for a certain term are increasing, that may be an angle to pursue in a piece of content. <br><br>Below is the search history of “blogging” over the past five years. From this result, it’s reasonable to assume that search volume for this term is on a slight decline, and that my research process could benefit from more specific search terms to really pinpoint my audience.</li> \n</ul> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blogging%20%20%20Explore%20%20%20Google%20Trends.png?width=669&amp;name=blogging%20%20%20Explore%20%20%20Google%20Trends.png\" alt=\"blogging   Explore   Google Trends.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"blogging   Explore   Google Trends.png\"> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\">Google Ads Keyword Planner:</a></strong>&nbsp;This tool&nbsp;shows you the search volume of terms compared to similar terms. This is&nbsp;helpful to determine which words or set of several keywords, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-long-tail-keyword-100-words-sr\">long-tail keywords</a>, are the most popular in search. These long-tail keywords will help determine the angle your content should address.&nbsp;</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-trial-keywords-tool\">HubSpot SEO Marketing Software:</a></strong> If you're a HubSpot customer, this handy app has several of the above capabilities already built-in. You can use the tool to conduct general keyword research and narrow your focus when selecting a topic. For example, I once searched for “blogging” and found that “how to make money from blogging” has a high number of search terms, so I might consider that angle as the topic of my infographic.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Keep search terms broad to find lots of data.</h3> \n<p>Once you start to conduct&nbsp;research on the topic of your infographic, don’t limit your content by what angle you <em>think</em> the infographic should pursue. It’s smart to do general research on a topic so you gain a basic understanding, but be mindful that it can influence the information you’re searching for.</p> \n<p>For example, if you decided to focus your infographic on how to make money from blogging and only researched advertising as a means to achieve that goal, the data you pull won’t provide all of the information necessary to create a comprehensive infographic.</p> \n<p>Research a topic, not a particular story or angle, until you have more concrete data.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/\">Google Scholar:</a></strong>&nbsp;This resource serves as a great place to start your research. It’s a free search engine of scholarly literature on a variety of different topics and disciplines that will give you an idea of the type of data aggregated on the topics you research.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/\">JSTOR:</a></strong>&nbsp;This tool provides a&nbsp;database of primary resources, such as journals, original research, and books. You may need to purchase login access ($19.50/month) or log in through the credentials of an academic institution you’re associated with.</li> \n <li><i><strong><a href=\"https://hbr.org/\">Harvard Business Review:</a></strong>&nbsp;HBR</i>&nbsp;is a scholarly magazine that publishes research, case studies, and statistics on a variety of different topics, including business, leadership, strategy, and economics.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Pull data from reputable, original, and validated sources.</h3> \n<p>When you find data during your research process, we recommend the following standards to decide&nbsp;whether or not to use it in your content:</p> \n<p><strong>Is it original?</strong></p> \n<p>Find the original data source for any statistics you encounter during your research process. Due to the plethora of different blogs and news outlets, many different websites can cite the same statistic without citing its original source. If you find a compelling data point that you want to use in your infographic, trace it to the original research source.</p> \n<p>If you can’t find the original source, the statistic is unsubstantiated and shouldn’t be used.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it reputable?</strong></p> \n<p>Another question to ask yourself <i>when</i> conducting research is <i>where</i> you’re conducting research. Any individual or organization can start a website and publish content, but that doesn’t mean all content on the internet can be taken as fact.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.verticalmeasures.com/content-marketing-2/how-to-do-research-for-an-infographic-video/\">Vertical Measures</a>&nbsp;recommends starting internet research on .gov, .edu, and .org sites, which are associated with governing bodies, educational institutions, and organizations with greater legitimacy than blogs or individuals.</p> \n<p><strong>Can it be validated?</strong></p> \n<p>Even if you find a statistic on a reputable source, you’re not done yet. <a href=\"https://raventools.com/blog/infographic-research/\">Raven Tools</a>&nbsp;recommends that researchers make sure to properly fact-check information they find by a) determining if it’s cited by any other organizations or b) checking the methodology of its original research. If the data point seems unreasonable, trust your instincts and dig deeper.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/\">Pew Research Center:</a></strong>&nbsp;\"From economic conditions, to political attitudes, to social media usage, the Pew Research Center website has a ton of free research that you can use to better understand your target market,\" noted HubSpot Content Strategy Manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamioetting\">Jami Oetting</a>&nbsp;in her roundup of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-tools-resources#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">best market research tools</a>.&nbsp;Check out the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-tools-resources?&amp;_ga=1.230592218.7546083.1477915232#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">full article</a> for even more related tools.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Research:</a></strong>&nbsp;Our very own research hub offers free market research data and <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/charts?_ga=1.150021622.170111609.1470925141\">presentation tools</a> to visualize your data.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Use recent data.</h3> \n<p>You've put time and resources into researching and designing a great infographic.</p> \n<p>Make sure you cite recent data so other sources will be interested in referencing&nbsp;your graphic once it's published.</p> \n<p>We recommend sticking with data that’s one to two years old so your graphic will be relevant for months to come.</p> \n<p>As a caveat, some original research data that would make a compelling case for your infographic may have set the standard for its industry more than two years ago.</p> \n<p>For example, I’ve referenced research on the <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/PsychofCuriosity.pdf\">curiosity gap</a>&nbsp;that’s from 1994 in previous posts, as this original study coined the term that’s still used today.</p> \n<p>The trick is to find <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1308286\">more recent research</a>&nbsp;that re-tests and substantiates the original theory so it’s a legitimate data point, instead of simply dropping an older statistic into your infographic.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/advanced_search\"><strong>Google Advanced Search:</strong></a>&nbsp;This feature allows you to limit search results to a certain timeframe to search&nbsp;for only the most recent info available. If you have trouble, widen the time range slightly. To set this up, enter a search term, select ‘Search Tools’ in the menu bar at the top of the page, and narrow your results by choosing how recently you want the data to have been published.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google%20advanced%20search.png?width=640&amp;name=google%20advanced%20search.png\" alt=\"google advanced search results for blogging.png\" width=\"640\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;\"></p> \n<p>With the feature above, you can filter your search engine results according to when articles were published and according to their domains (.gov, .edu, .org, .com), among other features.</p> \n<h3>6. Imagine how your data could be visualized.</h3> \n<p>Remember what Siege Media found?</p> \n<p>The most-shared infographics had an average of just under 400 words. This means that the graphics relied on data visualizations, charts, and illustrations to tell the data’s story.</p> \n<p>Research for a blog post is different than research for an infographic because visitors expect to read a blog, but they don’t necessarily anticipate close-reading a graphic.</p> \n<p>Think about data that can be turned into visuals while you research. Numbers, such as percentages, survey results, and change over time can be easily <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/data-visualization-choosing-chart-0?hs_preview=SwwNpWDi-4361706628#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">visualized</a>&nbsp;using graphs and charts.</p> \n<p>Are there categories within your data that you can visualize using icons or illustrations? Can you turn a multi-step process into a mini-graphic instead of writing it out?</p> \n<p>Analyze all of your research findings wearing the hat of an illustrator and ask yourself if there’s a balance between data that can be visualized and data that must be written out.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva:</a></strong> HubSpot Senior Content Strategist <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandazantalwiener\">Amanda Zantal-Wiener</a>&nbsp;wrote an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-for-creating-infographics#sm.000825bf4hgvedv10qu25jm8py60v\">article</a>&nbsp;about tools to make your own infographics, and Canva made the top of the list. Even if you won't design your infographic yourself, experiment with this design tool (and others on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-for-creating-infographics?&amp;_ga=1.235833927.7546083.1477915232#sm.00001jv8k2j9vzembr7434ir2v3u3\">the list</a>) to see how easily your data can, or cannot, be visualized.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>7. Use the data you've compiled to craft a story.</h3> \n<p>When you think you’re done with your research, try to lay out the story that your graphic will tell. You may even want to storyboard your infographic: Write out your data points, and lay them out according to the order they’ll be visualized in the infographic. Does the story make sense? If the story isn’t clear or obvious, then you’re not done researching.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the story you think your graphic should tell, but does your research data actually tell the story? <a href=\"http://www.verticalmeasures.com/content-marketing-2/how-to-do-research-for-an-infographic-video/\">Vertical Measures</a>&nbsp;suggests that you let&nbsp;the research drive the topic and narrative of the infographic. If you’re stuck in what you think the data should be saying, you run the risk of citing your research in a way that manipulates the data.</p> \n<p>If a data point isn’t self-evident as a visualization, it’s probably not the right data point, or it doesn’t have the right context. Go back and gather more research if you can’t craft a story that makes sense with just the data -- If you have to fill in too much with text, it will make for a visually unappealing and potentially incorrect infographic.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/trello-board-tips-for-teams#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">Trello</a>.</strong>&nbsp;This interactive planning and organizing tool lets you create cards that you can move around your board to organize in any way you want. You can storyboard using Trello by creating cards with different statistics on them and rearranging them to create a skeleton for your infographic.</li> \n <li><strong>Index Cards:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so this one requires you to get a little crafty, but it's actually my personal favorite method. Write out the key facts of your story and start laying them out on your desk to get an idea of your infographic’s flow.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8. Choose a provocative fact to anchor your infographic.</h3> \n<p>Strong infographics are loaded with interesting data that’s beautifully illustrated. These infographics are shared when they prompt an emotional response.</p> \n<p>Content that shocks, disgusts, saddens, delights, or scares people performs well: Researchers Jacopo Staiano and Marco Guerini found that content that prompts feelings of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04723.pdf\">valence, arousal, and dominance</a>&nbsp;tends to go viral.</p> \n<p>Additionally, in an analysis of photos shared on Reddit,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.frac.tl/research/viral-emotions-study-2\">Fractl</a>&nbsp;found that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/shareable-content-emotions#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">positive emotions</a>&nbsp;were most likely to generate virality, but that content that provoked negative emotions with the right combination of arousal and dominance could be hits as well.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://raventools.com/blog/infographic-research/\">Raven Tools</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://killerinfographics.com/conducting-research-that-matters.html\">Killer Infographics</a>&nbsp;suggest finding a data point that gets to the heart of the topic you’re tackling to hook your reader and incite an emotion that will make them share your graphic. Then, use that hook as the infographic’s visual focal point, and build the rest of your story around it.</p> \n<p>Check out Siege Media’s meta <a href=\"http://www.siegemedia.com/most-popular-infographics\">infographic</a>&nbsp;about what makes infographics popular. They visualize and highlight the most surprising findings first to keep viewers scrolling, and then break down each finding with more research results.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/siegemedia.png?width=669&amp;name=siegemedia.png\" alt=\"siegemedia infographic example\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"siegemedia.png\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.siegemedia.com/creation/infographics\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Image Source</span></a></p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google Search:</a>&nbsp;</strong>To avoid being&nbsp;repetitive, &nbsp;“[topic] + infographic” to see what else is out there. Ask yourself:&nbsp;<span>Has this angle already been covered, or would you provide a unique view on the topic?</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>9. Get feedback from your peers.</h3> \n<p>This may seem obvious, but feedback is a critical step in determining when the research phase is over and when writing and designing your infographic can begin. Before presenting a design proposal to your manager or client, tap your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/peer-feedback-tips#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra\">peers</a>&nbsp;for their input. Ask questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you understand the story’s flow?</li> \n <li>Is the hook of the infographic interesting?</li> \n <li>Does this data need further explanation to make sense?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>It’s often challenging to remove yourself from a project you’re immersed in to honestly edit it, so feedback during the research phase will identify any weaknesses that may need to be addressed with the help of further fact-finding.</p> \n<h4>Tools:</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive:</a></strong>&nbsp;Teams can provide feedback on documents and images by sharing them on Google Drive&nbsp;and leaving feedback comments.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740\">PDF Preview:</a></strong>&nbsp;This tool lets you edit image files and share them with your team for feedback. They can add comments or delete items from the infographic and share their feedback with you by sending PDF or JPEG files back and forth.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Ready to Research?</h2> \n<p>In most cases, great&nbsp;data is the foundation of a successful infographic, so it’s worth investing time and efforts in finding the most relevant, current, and credible information out there.</p> \n<p>Key to the process is remaining open to letting the research inform the editorial strategy, instead of the other way around.

It tells you how they do things, what they prefer, and who they are.</p> \n<p>And when it comes to social media, our love for data doesn't fade.</p> \n<p>That's why we love analytics and insights. They help you measure the impact of your marketing efforts across different channels to see if there's something you need to do differently -- like target a different audience, post at a certain time of day, or experiment with a new content format.</p> \n<p>Instagram Insights are no exception. Here are the analytics on this channel that marketers need to know and understand -- and how to use them.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To use Instagram Insights, you must first have a business profile.</p> \n<p>If you're already using a personal account, you can switch to a business profile. In order to have a Business Account, you must also have a Facebook Page for your brand. Instagram will give you the option to create a new one during this process if you don't already have one. Here's how to convert your account in a few simple steps.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Once your set up as a Business Account, you can begin to use Instagram Insights. Here's how to get started.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Click the insights icon.</h3> \n<p>To view insights into your overall Instagram account, start by visiting your profile. Then, at the top, click the icon of a bar chart, which will take you to your overall insights.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2136%20copy.png?width=300&amp;name=IMG_2136%20copy.png\" alt=\"Instagram Profile with circled Instagram Insights Icon\" width=\"300\" title=\"IMG_2136 copy.png\" style=\"width: 300px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>From there, you'll see some general information about people are engaging with your profile, like how many followers you gained or lost in the past week.</p> \n<p>Next, we'll get into the more specific profile insights you can explore.</p> \n<h3>2. View your impressions and reach.</h3> \n<p>This insight represents how many times your ads appeared on users' screens. Reach reflects the number of unique users that have seen any of your Instagram posts.</p> \n<h3>3. Determine website clicks.</h3> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times any links you've included in your business profile have been clicked.</p> \n<h3>4. Track profile visits and followers.</h3> \n<p>Profile visits reflects the number of times your profile has been viewed. Followers reflect how many followers you've gained or lost over the past week, as well as the average times of day when your followers are using Instagram — data that can be highly beneficial when planning posts. To view insights for a specific Instagram post, start by visiting your profile. Tap on the post you'd like to look into, then click \"View Insights\" below the image.</p> \n<h3>5. Click view insights below a post for specifics.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>You may have also promoted a certain post -- if that's the case, an arrow icon that looks like this will appear:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg?width=59&amp;name=13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg\" alt=\"View Post insights button on Instagram\" title=\"13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg\" width=\"59\" style=\"width: 59px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>For these posts, you can either view insights on the original version of the post, or specific ones from its promotion. For the latter, tap \"Promotion.\"</p> \n<p>Next, we'll get into the more specific post insights you can explore.</p> \n<h3>6. View your posts likes, comments, and saves.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Likes speaks for itself, and reflects the number of users who liked your post.

View Instagram Story Insights</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Finally, Instagram users with a business profile are able to view insights into their ephemeral Stories. Instagram does not, however, offer such analytics for live videos.</span></p> \n<p>To view your Story insights, start by visiting your profile. Then, at the top, tap the icon of the bar chart, which will take you to your overall profile insights.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2136%20copy.png?width=300&amp;name=IMG_2136%20copy.png\" alt=\"Instagram profile insights feature\" width=\"300\" title=\"IMG_2136 copy.png\" style=\"width: 300px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Scroll down to the Stories section, and you'll be able to see insights for older stories, as well as any that have not yet expired.</p> \n<p>Next, we'll get into the more specific Story insights you can explore.</p> \n<h4>Impressions</h4> \n<p>This insight represents how many times your Story was seen.</p> \n<p>When viewing these insights, keep in mind that you're able to add multiple images or videos to your Story. When you do this, every piece of visual content in your Story is counted as a single photo or video in your post.</p> \n<p>Let's say you add six photos to your Story. Whether someone only views one or views all six, Instagram only counts your entire Story having received <em>one</em> impression.</p> \n<p>The same goes for Story content that has been viewed by a single user more than once. Instagram still only counts that interaction as the entire Story having received one impression.</p> \n<h4>Reach</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of unique users that have seen your Story.</p> \n<h4>Taps Forward</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times a user taps your Story photo or video to skip to the next piece of media.</p> \n<h4>Taps Back</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of time a user taps your Story photo or video to go back to the previous piece of media.</p> \n<h4>Replies</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times users send messages through the \"Send Message\" text box on your Story.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2138%20copy.png?width=300&amp;name=IMG_2138%20copy.png\" alt=\"Replies on Instagram Stories\" title=\"IMG_2138 copy\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h4>Swipe Aways</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times users swipe to skip to the <em>next account’s</em> Story -- not to be mistaken for \"tap forward,\" which reflects users skipping ahead to <em>your</em> next piece of Story media.</p> \n<h4>Exits</h4> \n<p>This insight reflects the number of times a user leaves the Stories section entirely to return to the home feed.</p> \n<p>Now that you know how to measure the effectiveness of your Instagram strategy using Insights, you can analyze that data and determine what's working for your audience. From there, creating content that gets a ton of engagement will be a lot easier as you consider those benchmarks.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in January 2018 but has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-use-instagram-insights&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"eecd826bb39f09b5e07cac1f62ae055f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Amanda Zantal-Wiener","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2136%20copy.png?width=300&name=IMG_2136%20copy.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn83@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-28-550_00850413dbb8e0b7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg?width=59&name=13717845_659368444211466_1452706666_n.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn5@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-21-096_5e5ecfb6bdc5c630.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.01.33%20PM.png?width=308&name=Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.01.33%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-21-102_c3a6f7de0bb3d9f2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.06.26%20PM.png?width=433&name=Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%202.06.26%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-22-24-359_4803b943f96aea89.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2138%20copy.png?width=300&name=IMG_2138%20copy.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn46@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-22-27-224_5b3c709865855896.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-use-instagram-insights&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-22-24-444_eea03947b9e34ff2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336428},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"Is Page One Overrated? The Truth About Organic Search Results","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/page-one-google-overrated","description":"<p>For many marketers, ranking on page one of Google is the ultimate sign that your piece of content has <em>made it</em>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Every SEO strategy ever devised aims to get you there. If you're lucky enough to land a high ranking, you'll enjoy a pretty big advantage over competitors when it comes to finding new customers. At least that's the prevailing belief among modern marketers and SEO specialists.</p> \n<p>But — just how valuable <em>is</em> a page-one ranking?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.teknicks.com/marketing-research-survey-google-search-behaviors\"><span>Teknicks surveyed</span></a>&nbsp;more than 1,000 internet users using a representative sampling method to uncover their Google search behavior and find out how far they'd go to find what they're looking for online.</p> \n<p>Answers were predictably varied, but they allowed us to draw some pretty clear SERP statistics and conclusions.</p> \n<p>For starters, marketers who say the first page is the only page that matters aren't exactly wrong.</p> \n<p>However, simply making page one might not be good enough — more than <a href=\"https://blog.teknicks.com/marketing-research-survey-google-search-behaviors#.XyrB-RNKiRY\"><span>43% of survey respondents</span></a> said they wouldn't be very likely to scroll down the page to see additional results. If you're going to aim high, you might as well aim for the very top.</p> \n<p>And if you think page two is good enough, you might want to reconsider this search engine traffic statistic: <a href=\"https://blog.teknicks.com/marketing-research-survey-google-search-behaviors#.XyrB-RNKiRY\"><span>roughly 56% said they would rather</span></a> try a different search query or engine than click on the second page of search results. That's a lot of traffic to miss out on.</p> \n<p>And as for clicks? Pages two and three get&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advancedwebranking.com/blog/google-organic-ctr/\"><span>just 5.59% combined</span></a>. The percentage of Google traffic by results page decreases drastically with every new page you click on.</p> \n<p>So what do these SERP statistics mean for you?</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3><strong>What Marketers Can Learn About Keywords, Rankings, and Users</strong></h3> \n<p>When you know how far people are willing to search, you have a better idea of what your goals should be. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\"><span>Getting to page one on Google</span></a> is far from easy. In fact, it requires a huge investment of time, and potentially money (depending on the keyword you want to rank for).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say a marketer knows that only the top three results for a particular term attract users. If they're nowhere near that ranking, then they should put some budget toward paid search or social (if applicable).</p> \n<p>Of course, such a big investment of time and money doesn't make sense for certain keywords, since the value of Google result positioning&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/10/30/the-value-of-search-results-rankings/#2c8cb72444d3\"><span>varies</span></a>. An easy way to calculate a keyword's traffic value is to multiply its earnings per click by the number of searches that incorporate it and then multiply that by the click-through rate. Just don't expect that value to remain constant.</p> \n<p>It's also worth noting that keywords shouldn't be the main focus of your content strategy. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/timeline/google-algorithm-updates\"><span>Google's algorithm</span></a> is constantly evolving thanks to machine learning. As it does, keywords are becoming less integral to a high ranking.</p> \n<p>This makes sense — keywords were useful during the early days of search, but computers have evolved to more effectively interpret human speech. So go ahead and write naturally, incorporating keywords only where it makes sense.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/\"><span>BERT update</span></a>, for instance, helps Google process words in relation to the rest of the sentence, rather than one at a time in order. For example, the search query <em>\"Can you get driver's license renewed for someone else?\"</em> forces BERT to acknowledge \"for someone\" changes the meaning of the query.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is especially important considering how often people use voice-controlled devices like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri. In fact, <a href=\"https://blog.teknicks.com/marketing-research-survey-google-search-behaviors#.XyrInxNKiRZ\"><span>over 25% of our respondents</span></a> have conducted a voice search, and we expect that percentage to increase in the coming years. To make page one, you should focus on answering these questions and securing featured or Google rich snippets.</p> \n<p>And if you're wondering why we're only talking about Google search results statistics, it's because the search engine has cornered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/search-engine-market-share\"><span>roughly 92%</span></a>&nbsp;of the total search market.</p> \n<p>Does that mean Google search stats are the only ones that matter? No, but we think it's safe to assume that Google search behavior is representative of broader user behavior.</p> \n<p>So let's talk about how you can capitalize on said behavior by getting to page one.</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Start With a Question</strong></h3> \n<p>On the basis of the Google search statistics our data provided (and corroborating stats from around the web), we'd recommend starting your SEO journey with a question:&nbsp;<em>Should I even aim for page one?</em></p> \n<p>To answer this, you'll need to have a general idea of where you're starting. If you already have a fairly robust content marketing program, you may not be that far away. But maybe you haven't heavily invested in content yet. That doesn't mean you can't start — just don't plan on reaching search results stardom overnight.</p> \n<p>You should also evaluate the competitiveness of the keyword you want to rank for and be realistic about your chances for success. Depending on how competitive the term is, you might want to focus on other discovery avenues such as <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/podcasts/skill-up/s01/e07-voice-search-future-seo\"><span>voice discovery</span></a> (and no, we can't emphasize this enough).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You might also conduct an eye-tracking study for your term to find out where a user's gaze typically goes when results appear. It might land on one of the top three results, but it might also drift down the page.</p> \n<p>That said, if you're going to attempt a page-one ranking, you should still aim for the top even if users scroll down (more on that in a moment).</p> \n<h3><strong>2. Try Pivoting to a PPC Strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>If you don't see yourself on the first page anytime soon — or ever, you can pursue plenty of other avenues. Put some budget toward paid search, which can be even more effective than organic search results.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Roughly 35% of our respondents weren't sure whether they could distinguish between an ad and an organic search result, and people who click on ads deliberately intend to make a purchase. And the top three advertising spots get <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tabid/6307/bid/1514/paid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx\"><span>46% of the clicks on the page</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, you may have a shot at achieving success on the first page organically. How? Let's dive into that, next.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Play the Long Game</strong></h3> \n<p>To land a high ranking for a fairly competitive term across all channels that your customers are using, you're going to need to put in the time. Here's what to focus on:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Get your FAQ page optimized.</strong>&nbsp;An SEO friendly FAQ page can be a great way to increase your rankings and CTR. Just don't overdo it: The primary purpose of this page is customer support, so be sure it adds value. You can then mark up that content using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/faqpage\"><span>FAQ schema</span></a>&nbsp;and be eligible to have a rich result.</li> \n <li><strong>Focus on link building.</strong>&nbsp;Search engine algorithms are driven by links, which is why&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software\"><span>link building is critical to SEO</span></a>. Build highly resourceful content, develop relationships with other site owners, and work on getting links on their pages to your best content. Pro tip: Focus on quality over quantity.</li> \n <li><strong>Be relevant.</strong>&nbsp;You should be creating content consistently, and that content should be fresh. Regularly update old blog posts and pay attention to current events. The news can be a great source of inspiration, and building content around trending topics enhances its visibility.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Search engines want to give their users the best experience possible because they want those users to keep searching. Google search query statistics<strong>&nbsp;</strong>show that the tech giant's algorithm is constantly improving, leading users to more relevant results and more useful content.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>People want to find what they're looking for fast. If you want them to find you, make sure your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/seo-trends\"><span>strategy is constantly evolving</span></a>, as well. The moment you stop trying is the moment you slide onto page two.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpage-one-google-overrated&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":7159,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c7744ba3c7f10efec0ae07b935662e62","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Nick Chasinov","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpage-one-google-overrated&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn70@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-22-22-073_e704e2eac39e7cbc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311336425},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:22:16","title":"8 Really Cool Ways to Use Video in Email Marketing","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-email-marketing","description":"<p>This morning, as usual, I started my day by checking my emails.</p>  \n<p>While this process doesn't usually excite me and is just my method for waking up, I came across a subject line that made my heart race with excitement:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/6%20Effective%20Ways%20to%20Use%20Video%20in%20Your%20Email%20Marketing.png\" alt=\"An example of a video in a subject line. \" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Knowing that I would be starting my day with a new music video from one of my favorite bands made me smile. It also made me feel valued as a subscriber to their record label's emails — with just one video, <a href=\"https://shop.specialistsubjectrecords.co.uk/\">Specialist Subject Records</a> strengthened the consumer relationship I have with them.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This is why video email marketing is such an effective strategy. With a simple embed and subject line, you can build stronger relationships with customers, generate leads, and strengthen the content behind your brand.</p> \n<p>Let's talk a little more about it.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What is video email marketing?</h2> \n<p>Video email marketing is simply including videos in email marketing. If you're unsure about how to do that, we have a quick how-to post <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/embed-video-in-email?_ga=2.210323100.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\">here</a>.</p> \n<p>Because video is an extremely popular medium in marketing, (in fact, <a href=\"https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-platforms/video-marketing/video-marketing-statistics-to-know/\">83% of marketers</a> feel its importance is only growing) including it in your email marketing can engage your subscribers and increase your conversions.</p> \n<p>Additionally, did you know that over <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data?_ga=2.193425637.939240069.1576511670-940436819.1565181751\">80% of businesses use video</a> in their marketing efforts? This is likely because of the results video implementation gives them. While using video in email can seem like a taboo topic, it can be very effective.</p> \n<p>By using video, you can tap into the imagination of an audience that absorbs information visually — sometimes text just doesn't do it. With video, you have a chance to make dense topics more compelling for your audience.</p> \n<p>Next, let's talk about ways you can use it in your next email campaign.</p> \n<h2>How to Use Video in Email Marketing</h2> \n<p>Videos can dramatically increase click-through rate (CTR).</p> \n<p>For example, B2B software company Igloo Software decided to show off their workplace culture by creating 200 videos in three months for future email content. This approach <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/customers/how-igloo-boosted-email-ctr/\">doubled their CTR</a>.</p> \n<p>This is one way to use video in email marketing — showcase your brand in email and use it to increase CTR. We have six more, which we'll explore now.</p> \n<h3>1. Use video for bonus content to delight your subscribers.</h3> \n<p>Consider using emails to give subscribers bonus content. Email subscribers are likely<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats?_ga=2.244845068.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\"><span> to enjoy a variety of your content</span></a>, so going the extra mile with a surprise bonus could delight your audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For instance, if you share weekly newsletters about Instagram content, you can add a link for early access to a live webinar you're hosting about Instagram Stories at the end of the month. That way, you can build interest for the event, keep subscribers in the loop about things going on within your company, and give them an incentive to keep checking your emails.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alternatively, you can use emails to alert subscribers about bonus material you offer through other channels. For instance, this is an email I received from creators I subscribe to on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\"><span>Patreon</span></a>, a subscription-based content service:</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/C1bMv68XXlDrJ9NxRkHWFxq5E0FIuLZE1UyLEsIbmVMdxxNI83CcMM1qSBIEg9FShJFOCLUd8FW_Lc3I1LfBkPvzNRvpD2_opNLzqw6D0orEHbNwGQZoq_BN8FqFAdcw4tw2Bnty\" width=\"624\" height=\"361\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"LGTC video email marketing example\"></span></p> \n<p>The email served as a reminder to check my Patreon dashboard to see other offers. I could also play the video directly in the email, which is a great method for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-delivery-deliverability?_ga=2.244845068.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\"><span>email deliverability</span></a> <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/personalize-emails-with-smart-content?_ga=2.244845068.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\"><span>personalization</span></a>. It was a wonderful surprise, and kept the email format readable.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Make emails a more personalized experience.</h3> \n<p>Do you have a backlog of video content on your website? Consider using that to your advantage and sending personalized emails.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say someone watches a portion of a video on your website that they don't finish, and you're noticing this is a pattern when you analyze your website data.<a href=\"https://www.marketo.com/\"> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Marketo</span></a>'s formula is to automatically send that video in an email to remind that user to finish.</p> \n<p>By doing this,<a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/customers/marketo-video-enabled-business-case-study/\"> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Vidyard reported</span></a> that Marketo raised their CTR by over 144% due to the personalization of that email. If I were sent a video I meant to finish in an email, I'd surely open it to complete that video. I'd also feel pretty important to the company as a customer.</p> \n<p>From a business perspective, this means more clicks for you, a better relationship with the customer, and more views on videos.</p> \n<h3>3. Display company culture with a video.</h3> \n<p>If you're struggling with thinking of out-of-the-box ideas for email content that shows off company personality, consider heading to YouTube.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yes, you read that right: YouTube.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What better way to show subscribers the culture in your company than going straight to the source? Let's look at this email from beauty company, <a href=\"https://www.glossier.com/\"><span>Glossier</span></a>, to illustrate:&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SwF82M2gjY7Eb8Dn0XHCS6a_xdbWMpBQ3lruimwvEzu4xddI2lXyKamx-ow0iuAQ44p9Ji-mv5uTfdtmcXm932ubLSh_W-jeHccghGcQBbgedmB-qd4P1B_mPhop7oc_yMvxhvQk\" width=\"624\" height=\"487\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Example of Glossier inserting a YouTube video into email marketing.\"></span></p> \n<p>This email embeds a simple video from a Glossier influencer, showing viewers her morning routine using the company's products. If you click on the video's image, you're taken to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD2wWteW5vA&amp;list=PLWpusBRtNAW9CQwXDRCUo-N9D238vFEiP&amp;mi_u=115134%3Fmi_u%3D115134&amp;utm_source=glossier&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=9c0d6a58-a0ad-490c-bfef-76f212a62b26&amp;utm_content=1910c6fd-1137-4a48-8d3f-8e1301175604&amp;utm_term=\"><span>YouTube playlist</span></a> that highlights the makeup routines of Glossier affiliates, celebrities, and employees.</p> \n<p>Getting a peek into how Glossier employees use the skincare and makeup in their daily routines adds a sense of normalcy and relatability to the company. I got to see the people behind the marketing emails, and what I saw were employees who were just like me.</p> \n<p>Framed as a fun, <em>\"TGIF!\"</em> email, this messaging also had a promotion. If you click on the CTA, you're brought to Glossier's main product page with a reminder to spend Friday's payday at the company's ecommerce store.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Email marketing doesn't have to be a blatant show of products. Sometimes, you can subtly promote your products within a display of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-culture?_ga=2.42354476.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\"><span>company culture</span></a>. Try experimenting with a blend of public-facing content to promote your brand, like Glossier.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, let's say you want to bring attention to that new advertising metrics tool you've just launched. You might consider asking your marketing team to film a short video of the product's daily value. Then, you can embed the product page in the video's thumbnail. (Consider giving employees a heads-up that their response might be part of a marketing email).&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Announce an event with a video.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>If your company hosts events, whether internal or external, take videos of the events for a recap to send subscribers. This way, you can give subscribers a taste of how your brand works in-action and build interest in your company's events overall.</p> \n<p>For instance, do you host or participate in quarterly industry mixers? Try including a video in an email about the most recent one, along with a CTA for subscribers to learn more about the next one. The video can also serve as social proof that these events are well-attended and informative for other people in your industry.</p> \n<h3>5. Announce a product line or launch with a video.</h3> \n<p>Confession: I'm a <em>little</em> obsessed with makeup company, <a href=\"https://www.fentybeauty.com/\"><span>Fenty Beauty</span></a>. When it was first announced, I immediately signed up for emails. It seems fitting, then, that the team at Fenty Beauty teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.fentybeauty.com/fentyskin\"><span>Fenty Skin</span></a> for its initial launch.</p> \n<p>Fenty Beauty subscribers were sent an exclusive video from CEO, Rihanna, about the new company and what it would entail. It's a great strategy to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-marketing?_ga=2.42354476.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\"><span>market complementary products</span></a> through email, since&nbsp; subscribers are already interested in what your company offers.</p> \n<p><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZDtG-fLxEmoylT-RaArPi27qMzZWrWOLPItNhVbw-ueKmyfT9XEY2X2z19yZUn6AgPF6i9nx75nWtp0bYMhneP75LAD3LDQ--ue_oGoulQg0pY4YOFjMYCh1WMA-VW9U_B2BWhc3\" width=\"624\" height=\"471\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Using video email marketing for a product launch.\"></span></p> \n<p>If you're launching a new product in the upcoming quarter, maybe it's a good idea to include email subscribers in the pre-launch phase. For instance, if you're launching a chatflow bot as part of a CRM update, let email subscribers know first. That way, dedicated customers can express their interest in the product and bring in that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30490/the-qualities-of-a-powerful-word-of-mouth-marketing-strategy.aspx?_ga=2.42354476.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\"><span>word-of-mouth marketing</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Send out newsletters with videos.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>If you're giving subscribers scheduled newsletters with no video, you're missing out! There's a lot of ways to include video in newsletters so they can be effective. Video-heavy businesses can benefit from newsletter video embeds so subscribers can catch up on content they may have missed — especially if your subscribers prefer watching over reading.</p> \n<p>Another way to use video in newsletters is to round-up popular videos in your industry. If your company doesn't do many videos, this is an excellent avenue for you. Alternatively, if a member of your team is interested in a routine video schedule, try filming a round-up of weekly content in video-form.</p> \n<p>For instance, if there was a commercial that rocked your industry recently, include that video in your newsletter with a corresponding blog post about your thoughts to increase traffic on your blog.</p> \n<h3>7. Move leads along their customer journey.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Email marketing isn't just limited to loyal customers — you can also use it to nurture leads. Just use workflows in your CRM to automate videos that will move them along the customer journey. This works with forms you can add right into that video.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These forms might give your sales team enough information to follow up with interested customers. Or, give leads an opportunity to watch your latest crash course in SEO link building — in exchange for the completed form fields, of course.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you're currently thinking, <em>\"I'm no tech wiz, how do I do that?\"</em>, don't worry. <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/video/wistia?_ga=2.243830668.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\"><span>HubSpot's integration with Wistia</span></a> makes it easy to add this widget into your marketing emails. Check with your CRM software to see if it offers something similar.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"border: none;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QL8inYniLHNtmnD8mlUaXQU32PrPdNzWKAYTVD5_aQN_diuBltjwh8W-PjUOCu_nRmp8I4oI02EA-iI0aI4Mo4gf1bFfB6zybZ-GqgE4pbWw8Ge2AHuSFIGlWSg0MwbD6UGevToA\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" alt=\"Using Wistia to include video email marketing in a campaign.\"></span></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times;\"><a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/video/wistia?_ga=2.243830668.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p>With this integration, you can add HubSpot forms into a Wistia video for higher engagement. If a lead converts within the video, their viewing data will sync with their contact record. This can be useful for future customer research with video marketing campaigns.</p> \n<p>Think about piloting a video email marketing campaign for conversion. If you download viewing data, you can see how to tweak video content to further delight your customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>8. Include video in email subject lines.</h3> \n<p>Formatting is super important in emails and it starts with the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-email-subject-line?_ga=2.243830668.820272776.1598034036-940436819.1565181751\"><span>subject line</span></a>. As a consumer, if I see an email with emojis in the subject line, I'm immediately more interested in the email because emojis stick out to me and feel more inviting.</p> \n<p>Try including \"Video\" or a corresponding emoji in your subject line to entice subscribers to open it. You'll likely want to A/B test a variety of subject lines in the beginning to figure out what your readers prefer.</p> \n<p>Another important formatting tip is to embed the video in the email in a place that keeps readers interested. Putting videos at the beginning of an email is a good idea, but placing it near the end invites readers to keep reading to better understand the video.</p> \n<p>Video is an incredible way to engage subscribers, old and new. I just received a new one in my inbox, and I'll prioritize that over other emails. If it sounds pretty hectic to produce new videos for email campaigns, think about using the ones you already have. You may be able to repurpose them into great content for your audience.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<p></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>  \n<img
