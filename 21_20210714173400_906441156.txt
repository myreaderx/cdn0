The often campy cult hit uses a rotating retinue of actors playing different characters each season, and it&#8217;s a lot of gross, gory fun. The first season, <em><strong>American Horror Story: Murder House </strong></em>debuted in 2011 and quickly gained notoriety for its wild storylines, taste for melodrama, and fantastic performances from some of genre&#8217;s finest. A decade later and the series is still going, having gone through every horror subgenre, from killer nuns and alien abductions in season 2&#8217;s <em><strong>Asylum</strong>,</em><em> </em>to the straight-up end of the world in season 8&#8217;s <em><strong>Apocalypse</strong></em><em>. </em>Here&#8217;s what we know about what&#8217;s in store for season 10 of this continually surprising series.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683480\"></span></p>\n<h2>American Horror Story Season 10 Release Date and Where You Can Watch It</h2>\n<p>The 10th season of Murphy and Falchuk&#8217;s deliciously sensationalist anthology series was supposed to debut in late 2020 but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, <em>American Horror Story</em> season 10 will premiere on FX in the U.S. on <strong>Wednesday, August 25</strong> at 10 p.m. EST, and will be available for streaming the next day on FX on Hulu. There&#8217;s no official listing of the number of episodes yet, but the previous seasons have all had between 10 and 13 episodes a piece, each debuting every week after the premiere. (So, basically, if you wanna be among the first to watch, you&#8217;ll need to set aside your Wednesday nights or Thursday mornings this fall!)</p>\n<h2>So What&#8217;s Season 10 Going to Be About?</h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where it&#8217;s all kind of weird guesswork, so bear with me. The <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/american-horror-story-season-10-poster/\">posters</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CMni7mknbB4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">few cryptic Instagram comments from Murphy</a> about one story taking place in the sand and another taking place by the sea are really all we have to go on. Murphy has also confirmed on his Instagram that fans will be getting &#8220;two stories for the price of one,&#8221; so the <em>Double Feature </em>subtitle for this season appears to be quite literal. My best guess, given the poster and &#8220;by the sea and by the sand,&#8221; is that one story will focus on mermaids or sirens and be a nautical-themed horror story, and the other will be an Area 51/abduction type story, probably set in the American Southwest. Whether or not they&#8217;ll be connected by any story through-lines or we&#8217;re actually just getting two anthology stories in one season is anyone&#8217;s best guess.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s the Difference Between This and American Horror Stories?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s okay to be a little confused — the names are pretty similar. <em>American Horror Story</em> season 10 will continue in the vein of its previous seasons, with a single (or in this case, double) anthology story told over the course of the season. <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/american-horror-stories/\">The new spin-off series, <em><strong>American Horror Stories</strong></em></a>, will tell a different story each episode, more in the vein of something like <em><strong>Black Mirror</strong></em><strong> </strong>or <em><strong>The Twilight Zone</strong></em><em>. </em></p>\n<h2>American Horror Story Season 10 Cast</h2>\n<p>One thing <em>American Horror Story</em> has going for it is its huge rotating cast of genre and character-acting heavies. While fan favorites and regular players <strong>Emma Roberts</strong> and <strong>Jessica Lange </strong>are sitting this season out, there will be plenty of familiar faces for fans to get excited about. <strong>Sarah Paulson</strong>, who should basically crown herself queen of the franchise at this point, is back once more. <strong>Evan Peters</strong>, <strong>Kathy Bates</strong>, <strong>Billie Lourd</strong>,<strong> Finn Wittrock</strong>, <strong>Lily Rabe</strong>, <strong>Leslie Grossman</strong>, <strong>Adina Porter,</strong> and <strong>Angelica Ross </strong>will all return.</p>\n<p>Newcomers this season include model-actress <strong>Kaia Gerber</strong> and former child star and current internet personality <strong>Macaulay Culkin</strong>. Culkin&#8217;s joining the cast is honestly going to be the thing that makes me check out the newest season after the disappointment of the end of season eight and well, just skipping nine completely. While we don&#8217;t know what Culkin&#8217;s character is, we do know that <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/american-horror-story-season-10-first-look-macaulay-culkin/\">he will have a &#8220;crazy erotic sex&#8221; scene with Bates</a>, which makes for must-see WTF TV.</p>\n<h2>American Horror Story Season 10 Special Poster</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-683499\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ahsposterdbl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"699\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ahsposterdbl.jpg 699w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ahsposterdbl-360x457.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/american-horror-story-season-10-release-date-cast-and-more/\">&#8216;American Horror Story&#8217; Season 10: Release Date, Cast and More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HmzQ49d0kpk:Bs9DFrf7KOs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HmzQ49d0kpk:Bs9DFrf7KOs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HmzQ49d0kpk:Bs9DFrf7KOs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HmzQ49d0kpk:Bs9DFrf7KOs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HmzQ49d0kpk:Bs9DFrf7KOs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HmzQ49d0kpk:Bs9DFrf7KOs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HmzQ49d0kpk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:07:47 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ahs10header-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"d0e225b33f2e8e43fa7706ad5692d36f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn28@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-39-313_4b44ea618fec8c65.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":46376,"destBytes":32806,"author":"Danielle Ryan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ahs10header-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn28@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-39-313_4b44ea618fec8c65.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ahsposterdbl.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn52@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-33-47-524_7bae0cc9de6ece32.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-46-881_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HmzQ49d0kpk:Bs9DFrf7KOs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn60@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-46-165_1b880c82cd47dabc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-47-600_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HmzQ49d0kpk:Bs9DFrf7KOs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn16@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-46-771_369f19262962f630.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HmzQ49d0kpk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-33-47-487_4adf98f29c845c37.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284004433},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","title":"What is the Worst DCEU Movie?

So&#8230;you know, it&#8217;s not really that exact. On top of that, this survey is flawed because it completely omits<em> <strong>Suicide Squad</strong></em>, <em><strong>Birds of Prey,</strong> </em>and <strong><em>Shazam!</em></strong> At first I thought that this survey just must be old and outdated – but no. The Snyder Cut, AKA <strong><em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em></strong>, is on here, and so is <strong><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em></strong>, and both of those came out after <em>Suicide Squad</em>, <em>Birds of Prey,</em> and <em>Shazam!</em> Meaning that when the Survey Monkey swung down from his tree with bananas on his breath to put this survey together, he really goofed up. Smooth move, Mr. Monkey. Go back into your tree and think about what you did.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now that that&#8217;s out of the way, let&#8217;s take a look at the numbers, shall we? Here are the Worst DCEU Movies, according to this easy-to-ignore survey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Batman v Superman 22.19%</li>\n<li>Snyder Cut 21.37%</li>\n<li>Justice League 14.68%</li>\n<li>Wonder Woman 1984 13.70%</li>\n<li>Aquaman 11.42%</li>\n<li>Man of Steel 10.77%</li>\n<li>Wonder Woman 5.87%</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/aquaman-10-e1623414326456.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-676019\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/aquaman-10-e1623414326456-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"aquaman 2 title\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/aquaman-10-e1623414326456-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/aquaman-10-e1623414326456-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/aquaman-10-e1623414326456-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/aquaman-10-e1623414326456.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\"><strong>Do You Dare Disagree With the Mighty Survey Monkey?</strong></h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really have any qualms with this list. I mean, I don&#8217;t <em>agree</em> with it, and it&#8217;s immediately flawed because it omits three movies, but hey, I&#8217;m not going to get all bent out of shape. If I were ranking such a list, I&#8217;d probably say that <em>Suicide Squad</em> (which, again, isn&#8217;t even part of this survey) should be at the top – and therefore classified as the &#8220;worst DCEU movie.&#8221; Because&#8230;c&#8217;mon, it&#8217;s awful.</p>\n<p><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> would be next, then <em>Batman v Superman</em>, then <em>Justice League</em>, then <strong><em>Man of Steel</em></strong>, followed by <em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em>. <em>Shazam!</em> and <em>Birds of Prey</em> (which also aren&#8217;t even on here, you stupid Survey Monkey) would be next, probably tied, followed by <strong><em>Wonder Woman</em></strong>, with <strong><em>Aquaman</em></strong> at the bottom – meaning <em>Aquaman</em> would be the best entry in the DCEU.</p>\n<p>I know that&#8217;s a controversial claim for many, but I firmly believe <em>Aquaman</em> is the best DCEU movie. Why? Because it understands how to have fun. <em>Aquaman</em> is inventive, and strange, and funny, and features an octopus playing drums. If you can&#8217;t get behind that, well, I don&#8217;t know what to tell you, kids.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/worst-dceu-movie/\">What is the Worst DCEU Movie?

In a recent interview, Gunn confirmed that after he was fired by Disney and Marvel over offensive past tweets, Warner Bros. approached him and asked if he&#8217;d be interested in directing a new <strong><em>Superman</em></strong> movie. Gunn turned the offer down and eventually decided on <em>The Suicide Squad</em> instead. And based on Gunn&#8217;s sensibilities, that&#8217;s probably for the best.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683691\"></span></p>\n<p>In a new interview with the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/movies/james-gunn-the-suicide-squad.html\">New York Times</a>, James Gunn reveals that after Marvel gave him the boot for offensive tweets, Warner Bros. came calling – and asked if he wanted to helm a new Superman movie. &#8220;They proposed that to me,&#8221; Gunn says. &#8220;Toby Emmerich [the Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman], he works out with my manager, and every morning he would say, &#8216;James Gunn, Superman. James Gunn, Superman.'&#8221; Of course, we know that Gunn didn&#8217;t take the gig – he ended up picking <em>The Suicide Squad</em> instead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At that time I said I can’t commit myself to something right now,&#8221; Gunn says. &#8220;It was traumatic. I had to deal with myself. I just have to take a step back. So I took the different possibilities of projects I could work on, and for a month, every day I worked on a different project. I really wanted to make sure that whatever I was going to write was going to be a great story, and if it worked out and I felt like directing it, I could. <em>Suicide Squad</em> was just the one that came to life immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the end, Gunn was able to have the best of both worlds, because not only did he get to direct <em>The Suicide Squad</em> for Warner Bros., but Disney and Marvel eventually came to their senses and re-hired him to come back for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em>. But <em>The Suicide Squad </em>came first.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really loved [the original comic book writer] John Ostrander’s take, which was taking these Z-grade villains and throwing them into black-ops situations where they were totally disposable and they wouldn’t come out alive,&#8221; Gunn says. &#8220;I loved <em>The Dirty Dozen</em> as a kid. It’s that same concept, mixed with a DC comic.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Superman-reboot-Ta-Nehisi-Coates.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-659767\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Superman-reboot-Ta-Nehisi-Coates-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Superman reboot Ta-Nehisi Coates\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Superman-reboot-Ta-Nehisi-Coates-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Superman-reboot-Ta-Nehisi-Coates-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Superman-reboot-Ta-Nehisi-Coates-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Superman-reboot-Ta-Nehisi-Coates.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>The Future of Superman</strong></h2>\n<p>I really enjoy James Gunn&#8217;s work, but I also think he made the right call here. While Gunn is capable of sweetness with his work, he also has a built-in cynicism and off-kilter style that I don&#8217;t think would lend itself to Superman. As for what happens next for Supes, Warner Bros. is currently working with <strong>J.J. Abrams</strong> and writer <strong>Ta-Nehisi Coates</strong> on a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/superman-reboot-ta-nehisi-coates/\">new <em>Superman</em> movie</a> that will have a Black actor playing the Man of Steel.</p>\n<p>Some have assumed this means Henry Cavill&#8217;s days of playing Superman are over, but it&#8217;s still unclear if that&#8217;s accurate. Sources have said that the Abrams/Coates Superman is going to be outside the DCEU continuity, similar to both <em>Joker</em> and the upcoming <em>The Batman</em>. Which means that if they wanted to bring Cavill&#8217;s Superman back, they could. For now, though, everything remains up in the air – much like Superman himself.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/james-gunn-superman/\">Warner Bros.

As an unfortunate cynic, I actually do enjoy drama films about familial love. Even though I consider <em>Poltergeist</em> to fall under this category, there is clearly a timely relevance and seriousness with<em> Blue Bayou</em>. I also love how layered Cho&#8217;s character is and how the film seems to explore Asian American identity. &#8220;Where are you <em>really</em> from&#8221; is an often uncomfortable and ignorant question that many people experience in our melting pot of a country so it&#8217;s nice to see that written into the script.</p>\n<p>Focus Features describes <em>Blue Bayou</em> as &#8220;the moving and timely story of a uniquely American family fighting for their future. Antonio LeBlanc (<strong>Chon</strong>), a Korean adoptee raised in a small town in the Louisiana <span class=\"il\">bayou</span>, is married to the love of his life Kathy (<strong>Alicia Vikander</strong>), and step-dad to their beloved daughter Jessie (<strong>Sydney Kowalske</strong>). Struggling to make a better life for his family, he must confront the ghosts of his past when he discovers that he could be deported from the only country he has ever called home.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The cinematography is also noteworthy because of how sunshine and shadows are all captured. The approach makes the scenes simultaneously weathered but hopeful. Cinematographers <strong>Ante Cheng</strong> and <strong>Matthew Chuang</strong>&#8216;s use of lighting capture a notion of hard work, grit, sweat, and dirt in a lot of these scenes. This style also compliments <strong>Linda Ronstadt</strong>&#8216;s song &#8220;Blue Bayou,&#8221; which is where the film gets its title. With lyrics like &#8220;Saving nickels, saving dimes, Working &#8217;til the sun don&#8217;t shine, Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou,&#8221; it seems like an apt choice.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-576833\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ms.-purple-e1568378001603-700x308.jpg\" alt=\"justin chon interview\" width=\"700\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ms.-purple-e1568378001603-700x308.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ms.-purple-e1568378001603-360x158.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ms.-purple-e1568378001603-768x338.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ms.-purple-e1568378001603.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Building Borders and Breaking Hearts</h2>\n<p>Immigrant stories are American stories. Over the past few years, there have been some films that challenge the notion of what it means to be American and have sparked conversations that should respectfully continue. Director Lee Isaac Chung&#8217;s Oscar-winning film <em>Minari</em> is a prime example of what constitutes an American story, or an American film. Justin Chon tackles these themes in his films like critically acclaimed films like <em>Gook</em>, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/justin-chon-interview-ms-purple/\"><em>Ms. Purple</em></a>, and now <em>Blue Bayou</em>.</p>\n<p>There is an assortment of films that center around immigration, even in animated form with the lovable <em>Paddington</em>. There are also several films that depict what the American Dream looks like as well as stories of American families. However, <em>Blue Bayou</em> seems to potentially stand out because it is a feature film that specifically mentions ICE and the immigration reform that has devastated so many American families. In addition to examining American identity and culture, it appears as though Chon&#8217;s latest film is a heartfelt effort to portray a problematic and divisive topic through an empathetic lens.</p>\n<p><em>Blue Bayou</em> will be released only in theaters on <strong>September 17th, 2021</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/blue-bayou-trailer-justin-chon/\">&#8216;Blue Bayou&#8217; Trailer: Justin Chon&#8217;s Latest Film Promises to be Both Intimate and Timely</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=D3wQve8I3yU:HY4HF8qLf0Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=D3wQve8I3yU:HY4HF8qLf0Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=D3wQve8I3yU:HY4HF8qLf0Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=D3wQve8I3yU:HY4HF8qLf0Q:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=D3wQve8I3yU:HY4HF8qLf0Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=D3wQve8I3yU:HY4HF8qLf0Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/D3wQve8I3yU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 12:47:02 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blue-bayou-e1626266328589-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"7c12599b78ede36f82124ec484f05871","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-29-075_818df7782992b726.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":31178,"destBytes":18762,"author":"Marisa Mirabal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blue-bayou-e1626266328589-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-29-075_818df7782992b726.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ms.-purple-e1568378001603-700x308.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn84@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-47-524_0373cb3394980db0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-46-881_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=D3wQve8I3yU:HY4HF8qLf0Q:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn99@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-46-404_9bf9a1da6994ce14.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-47-600_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=D3wQve8I3yU:HY4HF8qLf0Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn68@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-33-58-658_d5d99ffe19509a82.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/D3wQve8I3yU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn72@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-33-47-056_28fec44bb827b26f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284004433},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","title":"Death on the Nile: Release Date, Cast and More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683472","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/death-on-the-nile-release-date-and-more.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-683520\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/death-on-the-nile-release-date-and-more-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"death on the nile release date and more\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/death-on-the-nile-release-date-and-more-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/death-on-the-nile-release-date-and-more-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/death-on-the-nile-release-date-and-more-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/death-on-the-nile-release-date-and-more.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <strong>…And More</strong>, our no-frills, zero B.S. guide to when and where you can watch upcoming movies and shows, and everything else you could possibly stand to know.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong>&#8216;s attempt to create an entire film series around Agatha Christie&#8217;s Hercule Poirot continues with <strong><em>Death on the Nile</em></strong>, a movie that has already had its release date rescheduled multiple times. And the way things are going for some of the cast members, it might just get rescheduled again. For now, though, <em>Death on the Nile</em> is set for 2022, and I went ahead and rounded up what you need to know in advance.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683472\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Death on the Nile Release Date and Where You Can Watch It</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Death on the Nile</em> is currently scheduled to open on <strong>February 11, 2022</strong>. That could always change – it&#8217;s changed several times already, after all. For now, the film is a theatrical release. However, since this is owned by Disney, the studio could always decide to drop it onto Disney+. They could also attempt to release it in both theaters and on Disney+ with Premiere Access. As of the writing of this story, though, <em>Death on the Nile</em> is destined for theaters.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is </strong><strong>Death on the Nile</strong><strong>?</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Death on the Nile</em> is the follow-up to 2017&#8217;s <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>. Calling it a sequel seems wrong, but it&#8217;s yet another story about Belgian detective Hercule Poirot trying to solve a murder with a cavalcade of suspects. The film is based on the Agatha Christie novel of the same name – a novel that&#8217;s been adapted several times before already, including a 1978 feature film starring Peter Ustinov.</p>\n<h2><strong>Death on the Nile Synopsis</strong></h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the <em>Death on the Nile</em> synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot’s Egyptian vacation aboard a glamorous river steamer turns into a terrifying search for a murderer when a picture-perfect couple’s idyllic honeymoon is tragically cut short. Set against an epic landscape of sweeping desert vistas and the majestic Giza pyramids, this tale of unbridled passion and incapacitating jealousy features a cosmopolitan group of impeccably dressed travelers, and enough wicked twists and turns to leave audiences guessing until the final, shocking denouement.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Death on the Nile Director, Crew, and More</strong></h2>\n<p>Kenneth Branagh directs <em>Death on the Nile</em>, just as he did with <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>. <strong>Michael Green</strong> penned the script.

It&#8217;s almost a blessing in disguise that Marvel&#8217;s movies were pushed back, allowing <strong><em>WandaVision</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Loki</em></strong> to shine. In fact, the finales of both <em>WandaVision</em> and <em>Loki</em> have set the stage for a huge even that will have repercussions across the entire next phase of the MCU.<span id=\"more-683664\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683711 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-hewhoremains-desk-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Loki - He Who Remains\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-hewhoremains-desk.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-hewhoremains-desk-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Loki Finale</h2>\n<p>Before we get into the nitty gritty of how the events of <em>Loki</em> and <em>WandaVision</em> will impact the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, let&#8217;s dig into the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-finale-review/\">finale of <em>Loki</em></a> a little bit.</p>\n<p>When Loki (<strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>) and Sylvie (<strong>Sophia Di Martino</strong>) reach the end of time, they meet a character referred to by Miss Minutes as He Who Remains, and he&#8217;s played by <strong>Jonathan Majors</strong>. This realization seems to confirm the theories about Kang the Conqueror being behind the Time Variance Authority since Jonathan Majors has already been reported to play Kang the Conqueror in <em>Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania</em>. But it also debunks them in a way.</p>\n<p>He Who Remains is really <a href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/He_Who_Remains_(Multiverse)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an entirely different character</a> in Marvel Comics. Not only is he the creator of the Time Keepers, but he&#8217;s also the final director the TVA in the Citadel at the End of Time, which is the last remaining reality of the multiverse. However, it seems that label has now been applied to Kang the Conqueror.<em> Loki</em> gives us a version of He Who Remains, who is a variant of Kang. Though the name is never uttered, the &#8220;conqueror&#8221; label is briefly mentioned.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, He Who Remains warns that his death and the creation of the multiverse will bring about multiple variants of himself. Since Kang the Conqueror is known for conquering timelines, it&#8217;s safe to assume that all of his variants will be creating trouble across the multiverse. But besides that, the mere creation of the multiverse will pave the way for what&#8217;s to come in the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-582322 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-farfromhome-panic-endcredits-700x294.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man: Far From Home Honest Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-farfromhome-panic-endcredits-700x294.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-farfromhome-panic-endcredits-360x151.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-farfromhome-panic-endcredits-768x323.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-farfromhome-panic-endcredits.jpg 962w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h2>\n<p><em>Loki</em> has officially paved the way for the multiverse to break open in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it looks like the <em>Spider-Man</em> franchise will be the first Marvel Studios movie to feel the aftermath.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been hearing for awhile now that <strong><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em></strong> will tap into the multiverse by not only bringing in multiple versions of Spider-Man with the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield from their respective franchises (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/spider-man-3-tobey-maguire-andrew-garfield/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">despite denials of such a concept</a>), but also the return of villains like Doc Ock (<strong>Alfred Molina</strong>) and Electro (<strong>Jamie Foxx</strong>), from what we can now assume will be branded as alternate universes/timelines created by the death of He Who Remains.</p>\n<p>In <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>, we&#8217;ve heard that Peter Parker (<strong>Tom Holland</strong>) seeks refuge in the Sanctum Sanctorum with Doctor Strange after his secret identity was revealed by J. Jonah Jameson (<strong>J.K. Simmons</strong>) via Mysterio (<strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong>). Joining him are MJ (<strong>Zendaya</strong>) and Ned (<strong>Jacob Batalon</strong>), who have been labeled as Spider-Man&#8217;s accomplices. Without getting into specifics until a trailer is officially revealed, it has been said that Peter Parker stumbles upon something in the Sanctum Sanctorum that will put him on a path to discovering the effects of the multiverse that was only previously teased as a lie told by Mysterio.</p>\n<p><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> arrives on <strong>December 17, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-548519 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Road-to-Endgame-Doctor-Strange-3-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Road-to-Endgame-Doctor-Strange-3.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Road-to-Endgame-Doctor-Strange-3-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</h2>\n<p>Since Doctor Strange (<strong>Benedict Cumerbatch</strong>) will be part of <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>, we&#8217;re assuming the events of the webslinger&#8217;s sequel will also plant the seeds for whats to come in <strong><em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em></strong>. Though what unfolds in <em>No Way Home</em> will clearly be focused on how the multiverse impacts Peter Parker, the events of that movie will likely signal a bigger problem that Doctor Strange will have to deal with in his own sequel. And the presence of <strong>Elizabeth Olsen</strong> as Scarlet Witch in that movie may give us an idea of what one of those problems could be.</p>\n<p>At the end of <em>WandaVision</em>, a credits scene (which was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wandavision-credits-scene-updated/\">mysteriously updated recently</a>) showed us Wanda Maximoff living in a cabin deep in the mountains. However, she wasn&#8217;t just enjoying a much needed getaway. Though Wanda was seen getting ready to enjoy a cup of tea, she was also seen in the form of an astral projection of the Scarlet Witch, reading through the Darkhold book of spells that will help enhance and grow her powerful magical and mystical abilities. But while Scarlet Witch was reading through the Darkhold, she was interrupted by echoes of her children yelling for help. That&#8217;s especially interesting since it was believed that her twin sons <span class=\"ILfuVd\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">Billy and Tommy</span></span> were only manifestations of her own magic within The Hex.</p>\n<p>Since Elizabeth Olsen has been reported to be a major player in <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>, we&#8217;re betting a major plot point will be Scarlet Witch trying to track down her kids in another universe. Could a variant of Kang the Conqueror be responsible for holding her kids captive in another universe? Will that be something that triggers the madness of the multiverse, or is it just part of the larger debacle that Doctor Strange is trying to deal with?</p>\n<p><em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em> is slated for release on <strong>March 25, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-481471 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/antmanandthewasp-trailerbreakdown-antman-wasp-facing-700x288.jpg\" alt=\"Ant-Man and the Wasp Box Office\" width=\"700\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/antmanandthewasp-trailerbreakdown-antman-wasp-facing-700x288.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/antmanandthewasp-trailerbreakdown-antman-wasp-facing-360x148.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/antmanandthewasp-trailerbreakdown-antman-wasp-facing-768x316.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/antmanandthewasp-trailerbreakdown-antman-wasp-facing.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania</h2>\n<p>Well, now that we&#8217;ve met one version of Kang the Conqueror in the <em>Loki</em> finale, it only makes sense that we&#8217;ll meet a variant of him in the upcoming third installment of the <strong><em>Ant-Man</em></strong> franchise. We&#8217;re not entirely sure what to expect from this one, but there is one detail from <em>Ant-Man and The Wasp</em> that will likely be a key component of the villain&#8217;s presence in this sequel.</p>\n<p>In <em>Ant-Man and The Wasp</em>, when Janet Van Dyne (<strong>Michelle Pfeiffer</strong>) is rescued from the Quantum Realm by Hank Pym (<strong>Michael Douglas</strong>), <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/quantum-realm-mcu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can see an entire city in the background</a>, implying that there&#8217;s a whole civilization in this subatomic world. Could a version of Kang the Conqueror be stuck there? Perhaps he&#8217;s been working on a way to escape, and after being left behind by Janet Van Dyne, maybe he&#8217;s pissed and wants to take it out on the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Majors <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-3-villain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was already cast</a> as Kang the Conqueror in<em> Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania</em> before <em>Loki</em> premiered, which is why so many theories about the character popping up in the show manifested themselves after the very first episode. What will this version of Kang the Conqueror bring to the table?</p>\n<p><em>Ant-Man and The Wasp</em> is slated to arrive in theaters on <strong>February 17, 2023</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683709 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-multiverse-tvascreen-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Loki - TVA Multiverse Screen\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-multiverse-tvascreen.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-multiverse-tvascreen-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Loki and The Future of the MCU</h2>\n<p>Now that his presence in the MCU has been confirmed, along with plenty of variants across the multiverse, there are endless possibilities for how the villain will have an impact on the next phase of the MCU, and that&#8217;s exactly what <em>Loki</em> head writer <strong>Michael Waldron</strong> intended.</p>\n<p>Before <em>Loki</em> even premiered, head writer Michael Waldron <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-mcu-ramifications-michael-waldron/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">teased major ramifications</a> for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now he&#8217;s confirmed how Kang the Conqueror fulfills that threat in a conversation with <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/loki-he-who-remains-jonathan-majors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marvel.com</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We knew that we wanted this show to be huge, and we wanted it to really end with a bang and have a huge impact on the MCU moving forward. Knowing that Kang was probably going to be the next big cross-movie villain, and because he is a time-traveling, multiversal adversary, it just always made so much sense. I came up with that big multiversal war mythology and pitched it out in the room one day to our producers. And they said, yeah, let&#8217;s go for it. We knew we were going to end up meeting the man behind the curtain. And then it was just on us to make sure that that meeting really delivered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Does this make Kang the Conqueror the new Thanos? The villain started out as a looming threat in a credits scene from <em>The Avengers</em>, but the full breadth of his threat wouldn&#8217;t be felt until <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>. Could we see multiple versions of Kang the Conqueror coming together as the next major threat for the entire MCU? That seems possible with how Waldron intentionally teased what&#8217;s to come. The writer said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You had to leave a lot of meat on the bone in terms of how evil he could be, because that&#8217;s He Who Remains&#8217; whole thing, that it&#8217;s not me who you should be afraid of. ‘It&#8217;s the other versions of me that are going to come.’ It was trying to really hint at that terrifying evil within without going all the way there.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>So instead of giving us a full-on villain, Waldron gave us a version of Kang the Conqueror who was at the end of his rope, tired of ruling over time. But he still wrote the character as a &#8220;very charismatic sociopath,&#8221; hinting at the madness that any of his variants could bring. Imagine how crazy and deadly a version of Kang the Conqueror could be when he&#8217;s not sick of living for eons.</p>\n<p>On a side note, the introduction of the multiverse in this fashion is an interesting way to retroactively make every Marvel movie or TV show every made part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

For starters, it looks like sugar, with its candy-like aesthetic – it&#8217;s a visual treat from director <strong>Navot Papushado</strong> and one of the all-time great cinematographers, <strong>Michael Seresin</strong>. Seresin shot several of filmmaker Alan Parker&#8217;s films, including <em>Angel Heart</em>, <em>Midnight Express</em>, and the joyous <em>Bugsy Malone</em>. To say Papushado was excited to work with him is an understatement. But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself.</p>\n<p>Papushado made an impression with his 2013 film, <em>Big Bad Wolves</em>, which Quentin Tarantino called <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/quentin-tarantino-calls-israeli-thriller-big-bad-wolves-the-best-film-of-the-year/\">the best film</a> of that year. Since then, Paushado shot a segment for the horror anthology <em>ABCs of Death 2</em>, but after a long wait, he got back behind the camera for this original but extremely referential action movie starring<strong> Karen Gillan</strong> and <strong>Lena Headey</strong>, among others (read our review <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/gunpowder-milkshake-review/\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>During our interview ahead of the film&#8217;s release on Netflix today, the filmmaker shared a long list of influences in his action-packed genre blender.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-681364\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>You have obviously one of the greatest cinematographers around shooting this movie. Did you two ever talk about<em> Bugsy Malone</em>? That feels like an influence.</strong></p>\n<p>I think we left that unspoken. We didn&#8217;t want to touch that stuff. No, I grew up on<em> Bugsy Malone</em>, and I think I grew up on that duo, Michael Seresin and Alan Parker, before I even understood there are people who are actually making those movies. For me, movies magically appeared in a cinema or on TV.</p>\n<p>I had video cassettes of <em>Bugsy Malone</em>, <em>Birdie</em>, and <em>Angel&#8217;s Heart</em>. I was a big fan of Michael Seresin before I even made the connection there&#8217;s a camera or the DOP behind it. So when hearing Michael Seresin might be available, I was like, &#8220;All right. Everyone knows their job. Everyone knows what to do.&#8221; And then he read it. He was living just two blocks from where I was living back then. And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, yeah, why don&#8217;t you come over for dinner? We&#8217;ll open a bottle of wine and talk about our influences and discuss the script?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I went there, and we just spent a wonderful day. And then the next day, we met again, and we just realized we loved the same movies, some of his, but many others more. And the approach I wanted to bring to this movie was exactly what he represents. It&#8217;s this understanding of the rich history of film, the mythology behind all the movies that I adore and love, which is pretty much some of his favorites. We wanted to see if we can bring it into something modern and contemporary and do the whole movie wide lenses, very colorful, something that is almost been done on a Technicolor era of, maybe it&#8217;s a <em>Vertigo</em>. What would have happened if Hitchcock [did this]?</p>\n<p>I apologize for trying to put me and him in the same sentence. It&#8217;s just for demonstrating my ambitiousness. And yeah, Michael, I learned so much from him. I&#8217;m very lucky to call him a friend. I was just on the phone with him a couple of hours ago. He&#8217;s shooting the new Noah Baumbach movie, and he&#8217;s very excited about that. He&#8217;s a legend.</p>\n<p><strong>What were some of the other movies you two talked about? </strong></p>\n<p>It always starts with this holy trinity of three filmmakers I adore and keep watching their moves again and again, and it&#8217;s Alfred Hitchcock, Akira Kurosawa, and Sergio Leone. For me, it all starts there and especially when you discuss the assassin genre. It goes all the way back to the gunslingers and the contract killers and the hired hitmen. And then it evolves into what Jean-Pierre Melville introduced. And from John-Pierre Melville, let&#8217;s stay a little bit in the French cinema.</p>\n<p>Jacques Denys is someone I adore. So, we say, &#8220;Okay, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we incorporate those Technicolors, those <em>Umbrellas of Cherbourg</em>, <em>Singing In the Rain</em>, into an Alfred Hitchcock, Sergio Leone kind of genre blender?&#8221;And then we discussed a little bit later on, the Michael Mann and Michael Cimino effect that on the &#8217;70s and Frankenheimer, Friedkin, and Scorsese. And being an &#8217;80s kid, I was born into the Spielberg-Zemeckis era.</p>\n<p>So I felt like this is who I am. This is what I want to bring in. I think those filmmakers were also influenced by the same eras that I was. So it became very clear that we want to do something colorful, super stylish, very meticulous, wide lenses, dim lights, almost give it a nostalgic, retro-chic, but without holding the contemporary or the kind of modern aspect of it, so it wouldn&#8217;t feel like we are indulging our own kind of, &#8220;Oh, we want to show you all the movies we like.&#8221;</p>\n<p>No, we wanted them to be there, in the presence and in spirit. We wanted to do justice to all the rich mythology, all the names we mentioned. I always felt like that when you&#8217;re doing a movie in a specific genre, you have to acknowledge and respect everything that came before you, try not to copy too much, but at least acknowledge that.</p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about the action, starting with the hospital fight sequence, which gives the character such a fun challenge to overcome. With the stunt team, how did you want to incorporate physical comedy into that fight? </strong></p>\n<p>For me, the two best action heroes are Buster Keaton and Jackie Chan. Their action sequences are funny, but more than anything else, they provoke emotion through storytelling. For them, it&#8217;s all about either the plot moving forward or the character&#8217;s arc. It&#8217;s never about nihilistic, shoot-em-up kind of a thing.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also a big fan of Asian cinema and Korean cinema and Japanese and Chinese and everything. In those movies, guns play a part, but it&#8217;s actually the challenges that you throw on your characters. It&#8217;s also a challenge on yourself as a writer, how can I push my heroine into the most difficult, absurd surrealist situation and see how she can come up or recover from that?</p>\n<p>Now, having said that, those action scenes were written the way that they are. But once the entire [stunt] team came on board, they kept pushing the envelope. They would come to me, and they would say, &#8220;Listen, Karen is good. Lena is good. We can push it a little bit more. How about this and about that?&#8221; And then Michelle joined in, then Angela joined in, and then Carl joined in. Okay, we needed to rethink it a little bit. We need to create more challenges for ourselves. I&#8217;m not going to put just two guns at Michelle&#8217;s hand. I mean, she jumped on a moving train with the bike. I can come up with something a little bit more creative. So, a chain would be more fitting, that will challenge us and her a little bit.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-644877\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/gunpowder-milkshake-1-700x312.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/gunpowder-milkshake-1-700x312.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/gunpowder-milkshake-1-360x160.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/gunpowder-milkshake-1-768x342.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>But from the beginning, it was always about the storytelling. And for me, the clinic fight also kind of represented little evolutionary step that the movie takes, from something that is more Jackie Chan, Buster Keaton-oriented, like the bowling alley fight, into the more cartoonish kind of Looney Tunes, Chuck Jones meets <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</em> And later on, you have the car chase, which is more of a &#8217;70s kind of a thing. And later on, you have more of a <em>Wild Bunch</em>, Sam Peckinpah, let&#8217;s go down in a blaze of glory. This is where we make our stand.</p>\n<p>So we tried to keep engaging with ourselves, with our characters, and also with the audience, with fresh new takes on, okay, not just another thing of what you already got used to seeing. No, let&#8217;s try to confuse you and dazzle you and then play with you. I always love to make the audience part of the movie, not just a spectator, keep guessing. So, she&#8217;s got her hands paralyzed. Hmm. I wonder what you&#8217;re going to do now.</p>\n<p><strong>The car chase is another good example of that. It&#8217;s big but in a small location. </strong></p>\n<p>Exactly. It was written like that. I think most of the car chases are being done with the budget of our entire movie. Now, what if you go smaller? And by going smaller, by giving yourself more restrictions, by thinking more confined, you actually come up with something that feels not only bigger but much more entertaining.</p>\n<p>I was wanting to kind of make my little homage to <em>Bullitt</em>, to <em>The French Connection</em>, but given them my own little take. How would that kind of a car chase be translated into something narrow and small and confined and how to make it cat and mouse, kind of a thing?</p>\n<p><strong>The ending is where you go big. What was challenging about putting all those moving pieces together? </strong></p>\n<p>That was a challenge. I remember Michelle, I think she was flying from<em> Avatar</em>, and she just came for one day, for fitting, for seeing the action. We were all in awe, because it&#8217;s Michelle Yeoh, coming to the training stage. It took everyone else a week or two. She just comes in and very elegantly, just nails everything. We were all like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s Michelle Yeoh.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Everything that comes to play in the action to do with the colors, the location that was firstly designed by our production designer and by Michael Seresin, but also with the costume designer, <strong>Louise Frogley</strong>, which did an incredible job, I think. We wanted them to be practical, professional, but still stylish. Like, this is their territory. This is their turf. So it&#8217;s a lot of moving parts. But if you have the most amazing team and the most amazing cast, you just need to make sure you don&#8217;t screw it up, I guess.</p>\n<p><strong>Having said all that, it&#8217;s a close-up of Michelle Yeoh&#8217;s face that, to me, is the high point. </strong></p>\n<p>She&#8217;s an icon. I think all these ladies are iconic. And yes, you have Michelle Yeoh in this one shot, which I think is a very also emotional moment. Like I said, most of the movie was shot with these wide lenses. For certain moments, we really wanted to emphasize something, like where it was Carla&#8217;s moment, just before the last fight. Those moments where we savor them. We wanted to savor them. You don&#8217;t see them a lot. Because they&#8217;re happening at the very specific moment of the script, they have that impact on you.</p>\n<p><strong>How about the bowling alley fight? How was it timing that fight? </strong></p>\n<p>So we wanted to establish how badass she is, even before she starts fighting. So it&#8217;s all the build-up. It&#8217;s her standing there, and the three stooges, they&#8217;re far away from her, and they&#8217;re not even jumping at her. They&#8217;re almost like they&#8217;re prolonging the way. And you can just go at her, like 3, 2, 1. But by building and establishing the weight, you kind of like, all right, she&#8217;s a badass. And they&#8217;re a little bit intimidated and afraid, although she&#8217;s outnumbered and outgunned or out-weapon-ed.</p>\n<p><strong>She towers over them.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. She kind of plays with them. She&#8217;s like this little cat, knows these three mice are coming. She taunts them and humiliates them in a way that will come and haunt you later. But when the fight starts, we wanted to create the first part of it in one long take, to kind of demonstrate how badass she is and how capable she is. I think for Karen, maybe I&#8217;m wrong, but I think that was most challenging and rewarding because then that&#8217;s the thing we worked the hardest.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the clinic fight doesn&#8217;t require the same set of skills, is more of an acting kind of thing, because of the restrictions. But this was pure skills. Karen needed to be well versed in the ways of martial arts and kicking ass. It was a challenge because we wanted to show the choreography. So again, it&#8217;s this couple of things working together. It&#8217;s the wild lenses, the long take, them, and the neon. You can see them as a silhouette.

She returns in 2021 with <strong><em>Titane</em></strong>, an even more stylized, violent and resonant work set to shake up the main competition for Palme D’or.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683653\"></span></p>\n<p>The film begins in a car trip, with a haughty teen obnoxiously prodding the father in the front seat. After excoriating her to stop, she rebels, removing a seatbelt. A moment later the car smashes into a barrier, her head lacerated and requiring surgery to implement a titanium plate that gives the film its name. The result is a grisly scar on the side of her head, and a sense of rebellion and anger that is not soon quelled.</p>\n<p>We’re never sure on the gender of the character (we hear it’s a her only in surgery), and this gender fluidity will play a large role throughout the film. At the outset, however, it’s clear that Alexia is outwardly presenting as female, twerking and grinding at an auto show while vapid men circle to admire in order to get autographs. There’s a shower scene that follows that plays with the prison trope of a dropped bar of soap to tragicomic effect, her wild hair locked in the nipple piercing of her neighbor.</p>\n<p>This is one among many moments where the mix of pain and pleasure is at the fore, and it also speaks to the way the character themselves navigates their sullen and withdrawn air with an apparent need to surround themselves with companionship, if only briefly. Walking in the parking lot only to be chased by an admirer, the film again turns expectation, twisting the notion of a dame in distress on its head and thrusting us into the most brutal of altercations.</p>\n<p>Alexia returns to the car show to spend time alone with her flame-covered Cadillac. Naked and dripping with water from her post-rampage second shower, she straps herself in on the cadaverous-colored upholstered seats and quite literally is fucked by the automobile. David Cronenberg, whose divisive <em>Crash</em> won a special jury award in 1996 for &#8220;daring and audacity,&#8221; would hopefully be pleased that a new generation has taken up his kind of cinematic kink.</p>\n<p>The following is a series of murders and mayhem that showcase the true sociopathy of the central character, only to land, in both elegant and startling ways, into an almost sweet family drama with a father who has lost his son. Think of this as Ken Russell’s <em>Yentl</em> and you’ll see how two individuals can share a lie for mutual benefit. Set in a fire house, there literally are flames that erupt between the two, yet in each they manage to find something to make each other just a tiny bit more whole.</p>\n<p>The film soon doubled down on the body horror component, and it’s here that it all feels a bit underbaked. I for one didn’t need the long, grand, protracted reveal, and it’s frankly a bit superfluous and supernatural for what otherwise would have for me been an absolute gem. It’s this insistence to further one-up what was already confidently a weird and wild ride that makes it feel as if it’s gone off the rails, while certainly the gasps from the audience may indicate others will feel far differently. I could have lost the entire storyline that leads to the final scene and had a far more satisfying experience, but I may be in the minority on this one.</p>\n<p>At any rate, thanks to committed performances by Agathe Rousselle, Vincent Lindon, and the rest of the cast, there’s plenty to bite into on both the character and narrative level. The dynamic between the two individuals who essentially adopt each other brings out much of the film’s heart, and it’s extremely effective how it all plays out.</p>\n<p>Take a dash of Miike and Refn, a whole heap of Cronenberg and, above all, Ducournau’s uniquely acidic vision, and you have a unique cinematic alloy that does far more than rely upon shock and horror. It’s a film that’s at its best when things matter and you’re empathizing even during moments of total butchery. It’s never easy to inject humanity into inhumane acts, yet <em>Titane</em>, like the metal, manages to do something remarkably strong in a compact form. The film does excess without being excessive, drawing us into Alexia and Vincent’s tumultuous world and finding that the deepest connections are based on the lies we choose to share.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 7.5 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/titane-review-cannes/\">&#8216;Titane&#8217; Review: &#8216;Raw&#8217; Director Julia Ducournau Returns With a Shocking Body-Horror Show [Cannes]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Pw9nfzK0IgY:CjeGmy6IXhc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Pw9nfzK0IgY:CjeGmy6IXhc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Pw9nfzK0IgY:CjeGmy6IXhc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Pw9nfzK0IgY:CjeGmy6IXhc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Pw9nfzK0IgY:CjeGmy6IXhc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Pw9nfzK0IgY:CjeGmy6IXhc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Pw9nfzK0IgY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:49:23 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/titane-e1626269617865-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"aec0a18efa8a984a7002ab8a99f4d909","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn20@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-39-275_bf897afa3a5d3bfd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":23077,"destBytes":14366,"author":"Jason Gorber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/titane-e1626269617865-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn20@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-39-275_bf897afa3a5d3bfd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-46-881_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Pw9nfzK0IgY:CjeGmy6IXhc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-46-536_24ce8563a287de15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-47-600_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Pw9nfzK0IgY:CjeGmy6IXhc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn99@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-33-46-882_ec5a839bf1610ba1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Pw9nfzK0IgY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn31@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-47-244_0373a14ea4348ef5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284004433},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","title":"What is the Multiverse?

Marvel&#8217;s <strong><em>Loki</em></strong> streaming series is only the latest in a long line of stories that plays fast and loose with the idea of multiple or parallel timelines. <em>Loki </em>follows the God of Mischief (<strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>) after he gets involved with the Time Variance Authority, or the TVA, as they try to correct problems in individual timelines. This provides us a chance to see lots of variant Lokis (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/alligator-loki/\">including our favorite chompy green boy</a>) and opens up opportunities for a lot of zany storytelling that doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to impact the primary timeline.</p>\n<p>The idea of multiple universes existing at the same time isn&#8217;t anything new. Some of the earliest examples date back to Norse mythology, which divided existence into nine worlds. DC Comics first introduced the idea of the DC multiverse in its comics in <em>All Star Comics #3</em><strong> </strong>in 1940, and Marvel later followed suit, starting with their <strong><em>What if?</em></strong> series in the 1970s. While the concept of parallel universes might feel a little daunting to contemplate on your own, these five television episodes will help you understand the magic of the multiverse.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683401\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683521 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/theparallel-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/theparallel.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/theparallel-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>&#8220;The Parallel&#8221; — The Twilight Zone</h2>\n<p>When it comes to television that changed the way we think, <strong>Rod Serling</strong>&#8216;s <em><strong>The Twilight Zone</strong></em><em> </em>is the forebear of them all. The original series ran from 1959 to 1964 and contained stories from science fiction greats like <strong>Ray Bradbury </strong>(<em><strong>Farhenheit 451</strong></em>) and  <strong>Richard Matheson </strong>(<em><strong>I Am Legend</strong></em>). Each episode in the anthology series told a different short story, most with the intent of exploring some political or social allegory.</p>\n<p>In 1963&#8217;s &#8220;The Parallel&#8221;, Major Robert Gaines (<strong>Steve Forrest</strong>) is orbiting earth in his space capsule when he suddenly blacks out and wakes up on Earth with no memory of how he got there. He&#8217;s uninjured, but the world he&#8217;s arrived in doesn&#8217;t quite match the one he left. His daughter suspects he&#8217;s someone else, his house suddenly has a white picket fence that his wife swears has always been there, and everyone keeps calling him Colonel, which matches his uniform but not his memories. He&#8217;s a little shaken until he comes to the conclusion that he&#8217;s in a parallel universe, and then takes steps to get back to his own timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Parallel&#8221; marks the first instance of multiverse storytelling on TV. It doesn&#8217;t do anything particularly groundbreaking and is a middle-of-the-road <em>The Twilight Zone</em> episode, but it&#8217;s the first, which means it paved the way for everyone else to tell TV stories about parallel universes and doppelgangers.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683524 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/startrekmirror-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/startrekmirror.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/startrekmirror-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>&#8220;Mirror Mirror&#8221;/&#8221;Crossover&#8221; — Star Trek/Star Trek Deep Space Nine</h2>\n<p>Did I say doppelgangers? If there&#8217;s one franchise that has capitalized on the potential fun of meeting your alternate self, it&#8217;s <em><strong>Star Trek</strong></em>. In the &#8220;Mirror Mirror&#8221; episode of the original series, a teleporter mishap sends Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, and Uhura to a parallel dimension where everything is reversed. The Federation has become an evil Empire, Kirk is a tyrant, and Spock has a goatee (that&#8217;s how you know he&#8217;s evil). The episode started several tropes about doppelgangers (including the whole goatee thing), and paved the way for future <em>Star Trek</em> iterations to really go wild with the Mirror Universe.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine </strong></em>explored the Mirror Universe more than any other <em>Star Trek</em> series, with stories taking place there over five different episodes. The first of these, &#8220;Crossover,&#8221; is the most important and sets the stage for the later mirror episodes. In &#8220;Crossover,&#8221; Major Kira (<strong>Nana Visitor</strong>) and Doctor Bashir (<strong>Alexander Siddig</strong>) have an accident inside of the wormhole near the planet Bajor, sending them to the Mirror Universe. It&#8217;s been decades since Kirk and co. crossed over, but things are still pretty backwards in the Mirrorverse. Instead of the Federation, there&#8217;s a coalition between the Klingons, Cardassians, and Bajorans. Terrans (a fancy word for Earthlings) have been enslaved. The space station Deep Space Nine is instead a mining operation, run by the alternate Kira, the Intendant.</p>\n<p>There are few things in the world as enjoyable as watching Visitor play her double role. The entire cast really gets to go for it with their Mirrorverse personas, and you can tell they&#8217;re having a blast. The Mirror Universe in <em>Deep Space Nine</em> gave the actors a chance to explore their characters in new ways, and it provided more insight into their individual pathos. Sure, the Mirrorverse versions were the &#8220;evil&#8221; versions of themselves, but there were still versions of themselves. Kira is a strong leader with a dry sense of humor, regardless of whether she&#8217;s the former Bajoran freedom fighter or the Intendant. &#8220;Crossover&#8221; set up the following four <em>Deep Space Nine</em> Mirror episodes, including episodes where Captain Sisko (<strong>Avery Brooks</strong>) must pretend to be his doppelganger and deal with the fact that his dead wife is still very alive in the parallel universe. Some of the episodes are silly fun, and some are a bit more heady, but they all get to explore sides of these characters that we&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-683704 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/eviltroyandevilabed-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/eviltroyandevilabed.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/eviltroyandevilabed-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>&#8220;Remedial Chaos Theory&#8221; — Community</h2>\n<p>The NBC sitcom <em><strong>Community</strong></em> frequently made its own riffs on popular tropes, and it had an utter field day with parallel universes. In the season 3 episode, &#8220;Remedial Chaos Theory,&#8221; viewers are treated to seeing six different ways the same evening could have played out. The friends, who met in a Spanish study group at their community college, are all celebrating Troy (<strong>Donald Glover</strong>) and Abed (<strong>Danny Pudi</strong>) moving into a new apartment. When the pizza arrives, group leader Jeff (<strong>Joel McHale</strong>) suggests they roll dice to see who has to go get the pizza. Abed, who is sensitive to tropes, points out that Jeff is creating new timelines by introducing chance, and then we get to see each of them play out.</p>\n<p>What &#8220;Remedial Chaos Theory&#8221; does is brilliant. It&#8217;s a bottle episode, all set in one location with no visible impact on the overall plot. However, by seeing how the situations change each time a single character is removed from the group dynamic, we&#8217;re able to learn so much more about the group as a whole. The episode gives us insight into the characters and their relationships by changing up the formula just a pinch and removing one element. In the Darkest Timeline, which leaves Pierce (<strong>Chevy Chase</strong>) dead and severely maims the rest of the group, it&#8217;s revealed that things fall apart without Troy in the mix. At the end of the episode, the prime timeline continues and it&#8217;s Jeff who has to go get the pizza. This ends up being the most positive of the timelines, which means maybe the group is better off without Jeff at all. It&#8217;s a great piece of character storytelling and even ends with the Darkest Timeline versions of Troy and Abed making felt goatees for themselves before declaring they are Evil Troy and Evil Abed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683527 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rixtyminutes-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rixtyminutes.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rixtyminutes-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>&#8220;Rixty Minutes&#8221; &#8211; Rick and Morty</h2>\n<p><em>Community </em>showrunner <strong>Dan Harmon</strong> clearly has a love for stories involving parallel timelines, so it&#8217;s no surprise that he expanded on those ideas in <em><strong>Rick and Morty</strong></em>, the adult animated series he developed with <strong>Justin Roiland</strong>. <em>Rick and Morty</em> is a kind of <em><strong>Back to the Future</strong></em><em> </em>for twisted adults; it follows the adventures of alcoholic mad scientist Rick Sanchez (Roiland) and his hapless grandson Morty Smith (also Roiland) as they travel through space and time. In the first season episode &#8220;Rixty Minutes,&#8221; Rick introduces the entire Smith family to the many parallel timelines that exist. He and Morty watch Interdimensional Cable in the A plot, which gives Roiland a chance for lots of fun improvisational gags, but the B plot is more interesting. In order to enjoy his cable watching, Rick gives Morty&#8217;s parents and sister a helmet that will let them see through the eyes of some of their alternate selves.</p>\n<p>Jerry (<strong>Chris Parnell</strong>) finds a version of himself that&#8217;s a huge Hollywood player who parties with <strong>Johnny Depp</strong>. Beth (<strong>Sarah Chalke</strong>) finds a reality where she&#8217;s not a horse surgeon, but a human surgeon, like she always wanted. Their teenage daughter Summer (<strong>Spencer Grammar</strong>) discovers that she was an unplanned pregnancy and that her parents argued about whether or not to get an abortion. In the parallel universes, she either doesn&#8217;t exist or her life is hopelessly boring. This leads to a pretty massive existential crisis, but she&#8217;s stopped by Morty, who has already had his fair share of timey-wimey weirdness.</p>\n<p>Morty takes Summer upstairs and shows her two dirt mounds in the backyard. He explains that he&#8217;s not the Morty from this timeline, and that he and Rick had to come here after things in their timeline got too bad. The Rick and Morty in this timeline had just died, so they slipped in unnoticed. Then, Morty gives Summer a bit of advice that shows he&#8217;s beginning to grow up a bit on his madcap adventures.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere.

Many fans woke up one morning in July 2018 to the social media firestorm regarding Gunn and many wildly ill-advised tweets that were disingenuously unearthed by far-right commentators, posts that featured inappropriately crass jokes and made light of topics such as pedophilia and rape. The filmmaker, who only landed on Marvel&#8217;s radar in the first place thanks to his intentionally provocative work with schlocky B-movie studio Troma, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3/\">soon found himself fired</a> by Disney as a result of the backlash.</p>\n<p>Obviously, things have since improved for the controversial public figure. He subsequently added DC&#8217;s <em><strong>The Suicide Squad</strong></em> and its HBO Max spin-off series <em><strong>Peacemaker</strong></em> to his busy plate, followed soon after with <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-director-2/\">regaining his <em><strong>Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3</strong></em> gig</a>. Gunn has <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-firing/\">taken responsibility and discussed these events</a> previously, but a new interview has him giving his most in-depth conversation on the topic yet.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683701\"></span></p>\n<p>Gunn&#8217;s frank and introspective comments throughout a wide-ranging interview with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/movies/james-gunn-the-suicide-squad.html\">The New York Times</a> have the added effect of giving readers a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes process of any major studio, particularly when a high-profile employee finds themselves in hot water. Gunn describes the events of that day in detail, particularly the moment when he first realized that his tweets wouldn&#8217;t simply blow over and that his job was actually at risk:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was conveyed to me by <strong>Kevin Feige</strong> [the Marvel Studios president]. I called Kevin the morning it was going on, and I said, &#8216;Is this a big deal?&#8217; And he goes, &#8216;I don’t know.&#8217; That was a moment. I was like, &#8216;You don’t know?&#8217; I was surprised. Later he called me — he himself was in shock — and told me what the powers that be had decided. It was unbelievable. And for a day, it seemed like everything was gone. Everything was gone. I was going to have to sell my house. I was never going to be able to work again. That’s what it felt like.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, any filmmaker or public figure in general who chooses to be active on social media runs the risk of posting the wrong thing at some point in time, having those posts exposed to a much wider audience, and then dealing with the inevitable consequences. That most definitely applies to Gunn, and he goes on to expand on what he&#8217;s learned, if anything, about choosing his words more carefully since then:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yes and no. I’m more considerate of people’s feelings today. I had talked about this a lot before those tweets were [resurfaced]. They are awful things, that’s what my sense of humor was back then. But before this ever happened, I realized that I had closed myself off to things I thought were schmaltzy because I didn’t want to be vulnerable. This attitude — I can make a joke about anything, look how great I am — that’s just not the fullness of me as a human being. And I learned that long before I got called out for the tweets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-419427\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamesgunn-groot-kevinfeige-guardiansride-700x351.jpg\" alt=\"Guardians of the Galaxy Ride\" width=\"700\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamesgunn-groot-kevinfeige-guardiansride-700x351.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamesgunn-groot-kevinfeige-guardiansride-360x181.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamesgunn-groot-kevinfeige-guardiansride.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Reckoning With His Past</h2>\n<p>As far as public accountability goes, this feels like the most any of us could possibly ask of someone who&#8217;s made some blatant mistakes in their past. Gunn has previously apologized for his actions, but what&#8217;s more encouraging is that he seems to recognize that this is now an inextricable part of his story on the path towards self-growth.</p>\n<p>Complicating matters is the fact that, while certainly a self-inflicted problem to begin with, these posts were only brought to light by far-right reactionaries who jumped at the chance to silence a vocal political adversary. Along those lines, &#8220;Cancel culture&#8221; is an example of a specific slice of rhetoric that gets thrown around a lot these days, which Gunn was also asked about in regards to whether he considers himself a victim.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I understand people’s preoccupation with that term. But it’s such a bigger issue than that. Because cancel culture also is people like Harvey Weinstein, who should be canceled. People who have gotten canceled and then remain canceled — most of those people deserved that. The paparazzi are not just the people on the streets — they’re the people combing Twitter for any past sins. All of that sucks. It’s painful. But some of it is accountability. And that part of it is good. It’s just about finding that balance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Again, these answers at least come across as honest and straightforward. There is certainly a broader discussion that needs to continue when it comes to which types of public figures are allowed to enjoy a redemption story vs those who are not afforded the same benefit of the doubt. Individually, however, we all can make our own judgment over whether Gunn appears changed by his experience.</p>\n<p>The Times interview also explore many less fraught topics, such as when WB/DC came knocking at Gunn&#8217;s door to offer him Superman (the very Monday after his firing by Disney, in fact!) as well as why he never even considered including <strong>Jared Leto&#8217;s</strong> Joker in his <em>Suicide Squad</em> film (an exceedingly good call, in our opinion). <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/movies/james-gunn-the-suicide-squad.html\">Click through</a> to read it in full yourself.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/james-gunn-on-being-fired-from-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3/\">&#8216;The Suicide Squad&#8217; Director James Gunn Reflects on Being Temporarily Fired From &#8216;Guardians of the Galaxy 3&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1wK3b9kvP5I:K6_Hg0D7Zb0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1wK3b9kvP5I:K6_Hg0D7Zb0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1wK3b9kvP5I:K6_Hg0D7Zb0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1wK3b9kvP5I:K6_Hg0D7Zb0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1wK3b9kvP5I:K6_Hg0D7Zb0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1wK3b9kvP5I:K6_Hg0D7Zb0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/1wK3b9kvP5I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:44:26 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/guardiansofthegalaxy-jamesgunn-davebautista-700x350.jpg","linkMd5":"1b4bc8f81fa293ced781e55fd910a2f8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn18@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-37-199_8387425f80bba192.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":38428,"destBytes":22760,"author":"Jeremy Mathai","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/guardiansofthegalaxy-jamesgunn-davebautista-700x350.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn18@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-37-199_8387425f80bba192.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jamesgunn-groot-kevinfeige-guardiansride-700x351.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn48@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-33-46-571_46cbe7c2d66ac524.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-46-881_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1wK3b9kvP5I:K6_Hg0D7Zb0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn95@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-59-226_bebe22a5351248f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-47-600_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1wK3b9kvP5I:K6_Hg0D7Zb0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn54@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-33-46-102_fe43ae2602d9b6d3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/1wK3b9kvP5I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn7@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-33-46-706_9c51b491e592532a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284004433},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","title":"‘Fear Street Part 3: 1666’ Trailer: Netflix’s Horror Trilogy Comes to an End, in the Past","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683668","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-683687\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"fear street part 3 trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all been leading to this. This week, the <strong><em>Fear Street</em></strong> trilogy comes to a close with <strong><em>Fear Street Part 3: 1666</em></strong>. And whatever you&#8217;ve thought of the trilogy so far, you have to admit it&#8217;s been an exciting event. So often now, streaming titles come and go. Whatever hype there is seems to fade after the initial release. But <em>Fear Street</em>&#8216;s unique strategy of releasing a new film every week has kept the conversation going, and helped make <em>Fear Street</em> one of the buzziest bits of entertainment this summer. <em>Fear Street Part 3: 1666</em> brings together all the threads (and surviving characters) from the previous two films while also going back in time to show us how all of this really began.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683668\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Fear Street Part 3: 1666 Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj3CXY8rKuY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Just what the heck is going on in the cursed town of Shadyside? Why is neighboring Sunnyvale so prosperous? What does the alleged witch Sarah Fier want? Who will survive and what will be left of them? These questions may or may not be answered in <em>Fear Street Part 3: 1666</em>, the third and final entry in Netflix&#8217;s wildly entertaining <em>Fear Street</em> trilogy. Inspired by the work of R.L. Stine, the series has served as a fun tribute to the horror genre as a whole, with the first film <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fear-street-part-1-1994-review/\">honoring the &#8217;90s slasher boom</a> trigged by <em>Scream</em> and the second film <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fear-street-part-2-review/\">paying homage</a> to earlier slashers like <em>Friday the 13th</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, here comes <em>Fear Street Part 3: 1666</em>, and as you can tell from the title, it&#8217;s going back even further in time. In the ongoing &#8217;90s plotline, the curse of Sarah Fier is still a big problem for high schooler Deena (<strong>Kiana Madeira</strong>), especially since her girlfriend Sam (<strong>Olivia Scott Welch</strong>) is now possessed by the malevolent power that turns Shadysiders into crazed killers. Can Deena save Sam, and the town? Maybe – but first we&#8217;re getting some backstory set in the early days of Shadyside. As you can see from this trailer, many of the previous cast members return here, playing different characters in the 1600s. And as you can probably guess by now, there&#8217;s more to the Sarah Fier story than what meets the eye.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-1666-image.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-683689\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-1666-image-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-1666-image-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-1666-image-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-1666-image-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fear-street-part-3-1666-image.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>The New World</strong></h2>\n<p>For this third entry, director<strong> Leigh Janiak</strong> drew on an unexpected source – a Terrence Malick movie. &#8220;As a filmmaker making<em> Fear Street</em>, but also just as a movie lover, I was so excited to pay homage to some of the great eras of horror movies,&#8221; Janiak said. &#8220;For 1994, <em>Scream</em> stood above all rest – it&#8217;s peak &#8217;90s horror and, I think, one of the most brilliant movies ever made, period. Then for 1978, I got to look at the heyday of slasher films — <em>Friday the 13th</em>, <em>Halloween</em>, <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. For 1666&#8230;I found the best inspiration for me lay in the beautiful world made rotten of Terence Malick&#8217;s <em>The New World</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Fear Street Part 3</em> features a cast that includes <strong>Kiana Madeira</strong>,<strong> Ashley Zukerman</strong>,<strong> Gillian Jacobs</strong>,<strong> Olivia Scott Welch</strong>,<strong> Benjamin Flores Jr.</strong>, <strong>Darrell Britt-Gibson</strong>, <strong>Sadie Sink</strong>,<strong> Emily Rudd</strong>,<strong> Mccabe Slye</strong>,<strong> Julia Rehwald</strong>,<strong> Fred Hechinger</strong>,<strong> Jordana Spiro</strong>,<strong> Jordyn Dinatale</strong>,<strong> Elizabeth Scopel</strong>, and<strong> Randy Havens</strong>.

Good, let&#8217;s get right to it.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the final episode, &#8220;For All Time. Always,&#8221; we&#8217;re left to ponder the multiverse-spanning ramifications of Sylvie (<strong>Sophia Di Martino</strong>) killing off <strong>Jonathan Majors&#8217;</strong> Kang the Conqueror, the all-powerful being revealed to have been behind the Time Variance Authority all along. But as all supervillains have a tendency to do, the mysterious &#8220;He Who Remains&#8221; is far from out of the picture for good. As explained to Sylvie and Loki (<strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>) throughout the episode, he seemingly has an army of his own variants ready to step in and wreak some havoc.</p>\n<p>Rest assured, a studio doesn&#8217;t cast an actor as <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/creed-3-cast-jonathan-majors/\">in-demand as Majors</a> for a brief appearance in the finale of a Disney+ show.</p>\n<p>While we can only speculate on <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-season-2/\">what will happen next season</a>, <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/loki-he-who-remains-jonathan-majors\">Marvel.com</a> talked with the creators and cast of <em>Loki</em> to get their insights on everything that went into the decision to wrangle Majors for this role. Creator and writer <strong>Michael Waldron</strong> goes into detail about the new supervillain&#8217;s backstory, his place in the greater MCU, and generally all things Kang:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We knew that we wanted this show to be huge, and we wanted it to really end with a bang and have a huge impact on the MCU moving forward. Knowing that Kang was probably going to be the next big cross-movie villain, and because he is a time-traveling, multiversal adversary, it just always made so much sense. I came up with that big multiversal war mythology and pitched it out in the room one day to our producers. And they said, yeah, let&#8217;s go for it. We knew we were going to end up meeting the man behind the curtain. And then it was just on us to make sure that that meeting really delivered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>As director, <strong>Kate Herron</strong> had the pleasure of collaborating with Majors up close and personal on set. Fittingly enough, his presence ties the entire series together and embodies much of the show&#8217;s main ideas.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was quite excited that we got to show him because he is the one that brings it all [together]. [He’s] the theme of our show. No one is completely good or completely bad, and people do fall into that gray area. I thought his reasoning with [Loki and Sylvie] that you can take me out, but I&#8217;ll be back here anyway&#8230;you&#8217;re going to awaken all these versions of me. And they are much scarier than me. I really believe him when he says that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683640 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-768x329.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Jonathan Majors Effect</h2>\n<p>The reason so many were excited about <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-3-villain/\">Majors&#8217; casting in the first place</a> mainly has to do with the amount of sheer charisma he brings to any role, which Marvel fans definitely got a taste of in the finale. Majors has enjoyed a much-deserved hot streak in the last few years, starring in the wonderfully understated <em><strong>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</strong></em>, <strong>Spike Lee&#8217;s <em>Da 5 Bloods</em></strong>, and the HBO series <em><strong>Lovecraft Country</strong></em>. As you might imagine, this screen presence factored in to just how to adapt the comic book villain Kang (whom Waldron describes as a &#8220;very charismatic sociopath&#8221;), toeing the line between being fun to watch and also genuinely up to no good, particularly when it comes to his variants.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You had to leave a lot of meat on the bone in terms of how evil he could be, because that&#8217;s He Who Remains&#8217; whole thing, that it&#8217;s not me who you should be afraid of. &#8216;It&#8217;s the other versions of me that are going to come.’ It was trying to really hint at that terrifying evil within without going all the way there.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In response to Marvel pulling off yet another magic trick with Majors&#8217; casting, Waldron goes on to call it, &#8220;So exciting and humbling. You have such an astounding actor who is that much more of a cool thing. You had to write him in a way that he felt worthy of being the villain at the end of our show<em>.</em>&#8221; It&#8217;s safe to say that few others but Majors could pull off such a casually easy-going attitude while still playing a convincing Big Bad, and Waldron seems to agree. &#8220;I knew I could always breathe a sigh of relief knowing we had Majors in that finale. We hung a lot of our hopes on [the character]. This guy is laying out, ‘Here&#8217;s the deal,’ and it’s one final test between our two Lokis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The universal adoration for Majors isn&#8217;t limited to the talent behind the camera, either. Hiddleston himself isn&#8217;t shy about heaping praise onto his villainous counterpart, as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just want to salute Jonathan Majors. He came in the last lap of this series and made an extraordinary impact. And it’s quite something to do that for a story, to get to its final chapter and to introduce the character of such breadth, and depth, and charisma, and intelligence. He was dazzling. It was our final week of filming, literally. He came in and blew us all away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was so exciting for me to watch because I knew that for Jonathan, as an actor, it’s his entry point into the MCU. To watch him come in and be so ready, and so agile, and so prepared, and so surprising. Sophia and I sat and watched him deliver this extraordinary performance of such wit and with such intelligence. It was a real thrill to watch him do that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>And according to co-star Di Martino, &#8220;He was so much fun and he absolutely blew it out of the park. As soon as he was on set, he was phenomenal. Like, no one could take their eyes off him. You knew something magical was happening and it was like, ‘Oh my god, are you watching this? This is going to be amazing.’&#8221;</p>\n<p>We could gush endlessly about Jonathan Majors, but fortunately he&#8217;s sure to be a fixture in the MCU for years to come.

After the final cliffhanger and a brief round of credits, we find ourselves right back at the offices of the Time Variance Authority that Loki first encountered in the series premiere. A familiar TVA stamp comes down onto Loki Laufeyson&#8217;s case file, but with a pretty major twist. &#8220;Loki will return in season 2,&#8221; reads the final teasing message. Yes, this officially confirms that the God(s) of Mischief will indeed have more adventures to come and more work to do while seeking their glorious purpose.</p>\n<p>Intriguingly, this is a stark departure from the precedent set by both previous Disney+ shows. <em><strong>WandaVision</strong></em>, which was billed as a limited series (and was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/2021-emmy-nominations/\">nominated for its 23 Emmys</a> under this designation), set up <strong>Elizabeth Olsen&#8217;s</strong> Wanda Maximoff next appearance on the big screen in <em><strong>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</strong></em> rather than in another future season of the show. Meanwhile, news quickly broke after the finale of <em><strong>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</strong></em> that <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/captain-america-4/\"><strong>Anthony Mackie</strong> would be leading a new <em>Captain America</em> movie</a> of his own. It&#8217;s understandable that fans may have expected more of the same with <em>Loki</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead, we&#8217;ll be seeing at least one more season of Loki and Sylvie on Disney+. Now, let&#8217;s get into the nitty gritty details about what this all could mean moving forward. Naturally, this involves talking <strong>spoilers</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Seriously</strong>.<strong> Major spoilers</strong> for the season finale of <em>Loki</em> lie ahead.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683640 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-768x329.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\n<p>So, Sylvie did <em>that</em>. After confronting the overwhelming presence of Kang the Conqueror, the man behind the curtain played by the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-3-villain/\">previously-announced for the MCU <strong>Jonathan Majors</strong></a>, Sylvie finally takes her destiny into her hands and shockingly plunges her sword through his chest. This immediately sets off major changes throughout the so-called Sacred Timeline and fractures reality into infinite branches, the likes of which Mobius (<strong>Owen Wilson</strong>) and the TVA at large have never seen before.</p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t say she and Loki weren&#8217;t warned, though! For the bulk of the episode, Kang (who goes unnamed throughout the episode except for his cryptic title, &#8220;He Who Remains&#8221;) carefully and ponderously outlines just what limited choices the intrusive variants have at their disposal: kill him and set off another multiversal war as his own variants once again wrestle for control, or peacefully replace him as the new leaders of the TVA and enjoy a fantasy-fulfilling life at each other&#8217;s sides. Naturally, their disagreement over what to do next is resolved by a fight, a romantic kiss&#8230; and a prompt kick back to the TVA through time and space so Sylvie could do what (she thinks) needs to be done.</p>\n<p>So what now? When Loki finds Mobius and Hunter B-15 (<strong>Wunmi Mosaku</strong>), the damage already seems to be done. Neither even seems to recognize him, leading to the final reveal of a Kang statue dominating the TVA offices where the ones memorializing the Timekeepers used to reside. And that&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s the tantalizing image we&#8217;re left with, and we must simply wait and see when season 2 will drop.</p>\n<p>Obviously, Kang appears to be positioned as the next multi-film big bad in the MCU after Thanos was finally dispatched once and for all in <em><strong>Avengers: Endgame</strong></em>. No rest for the weary, huh? Though Kang seemingly bit the dust in the <em>Loki</em> finale, we&#8217;ll be seeing either him or some form of his variants (or both!) pop up in <em><strong>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</strong></em>. And then there&#8217;s <strong><em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em></strong>, whose title certainly implies that it will double down on the multiverse that was merely winked at in <em><strong>Spider-Man: Far From Home</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>The MCU has taken pains to connect the Quantum Realm with the steadily-expanding multiverse, so brush up on your MCU continuity and be ready for these all-important feature films in the MCU. In the meantime, be sure to stay tuned to /Film as we scrutinize every inch of this <em>Loki</em> finale.</p>\n<p><em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em> will release in theaters on <strong>March 25, 2022</strong>. The wait for <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em> will be a bit longer, as it&#8217;s currently set for <strong>February 17, 2023</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-season-2/\">&#8216;Loki&#8217; Season 2 Confirmed: Let&#8217;s Talk About What Could Happen Next</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WzqPx4T4DmU:JtGTTkhpB-M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WzqPx4T4DmU:JtGTTkhpB-M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WzqPx4T4DmU:JtGTTkhpB-M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WzqPx4T4DmU:JtGTTkhpB-M:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WzqPx4T4DmU:JtGTTkhpB-M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WzqPx4T4DmU:JtGTTkhpB-M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/WzqPx4T4DmU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:14:28 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Finale-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"76ac4e4f7da5dd859c813bb927e2325c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-43-127_4590f8264dc22e75.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":19054,"destBytes":9106,"author":"Jeremy Mathai","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Finale-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-43-127_4590f8264dc22e75.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-season-2-700x291.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-47-540_69120364acd4eaec.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn88@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-46-706_1e6e3d72c93f295e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-46-881_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WzqPx4T4DmU:JtGTTkhpB-M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn75@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-33-46-779_25dd718810a90dde.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-47-600_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WzqPx4T4DmU:JtGTTkhpB-M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn11@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-33-46-478_2b8a98779efd7bf8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/WzqPx4T4DmU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn35@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-33-46-426_3627565559ed89fa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284004433},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","title":"Who is “He Who Remains?” Breaking Down the Bombshell Appearance in the ‘Loki’ Season Finale","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683633","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-683659 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217-700x302.jpeg\" alt=\"Who is the Loki Villain\" width=\"700\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217-360x155.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Alright, Marvelites.

Hello, Kang Country</h2>\n<p>It turns out that <em>Loki</em> makes use of not one, but two alumni of HBO&#8217;s <em>Lovecraft Country</em>. Sadly, that show was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lovecraft-country-cacnceled-at-hbo/\">unceremoniously canceled</a> this month, but we&#8217;ve already seen <strong>Wunmi Mosaku </strong>portray Hunter B-15 on <em>Loki</em>. Now, she&#8217;s joined by her <em>Lovecraft Country </em>co-star <strong>Jonathan Majors</strong>, who appears in <em>Loki</em>&#8216;s season finale as the mysterious &#8220;He Who Remains&#8221; in the <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/loki-he-who-remains-citadel-end-of-time-kang-statue\">Citadel at the End of Time</a>. The door slides open and he&#8217;s sitting there in his lounge chair, holding a green apple, as if this were the Garden of Eden and he was the serpent, there to tempt Adam and Eve (or in this case, <strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>&#8216;s Loki and <strong>Sophia Di Martino</strong>&#8216;s Sylvie). A big smile spreads across his face and he stands up and says, &#8220;This is wild.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It sure is. If you are or ever have been a comic book reader, the appearance of Majors in <em>Loki</em> is one of those moments that might take you back to the Wednesday afternoon thrill of a new issue where some mind-blowing twist was delivered. This is part of the joy of serialized storytelling, whether it be comics or TV or shared movie universes.</p>\n<p>We already knew that Majors had been <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-3-villain/\">cast as major Marvel villain <strong>Kang the Conqueror</strong></a> in <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>, and there have been Kang Easter eggs in <em>Loki</em> since <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-episode-1-easter-eggs/\">the very first episode.</a> Knowing Marvel Studios&#8217; history of mid-credits and post-credits teases, it was reasonable to assume that we might get something like that with Kang at the end of <em>Loki</em>. But that&#8217;s just it: <em>Loki</em>, the series, hasn&#8217;t ended yet. The mid-tease credits tease that we do get here is a stamp on Loki&#8217;s case file in the offices of the Time Variance Authority, telling us that <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-season-2/\">&#8220;Loki will return in Season 2.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>Majors, meanwhile, winds up having a much bigger role to play in the finale, so much so that he almost hijacks Loki&#8217;s show for a few minutes as he sits behinds his desk and explains his &#8220;gambit&#8221; through expository dialogue. He&#8217;s never explicitly named as Kang, and in fact, his appearance is more like that of Immortus, an alternate version of Kang in the comics.</p>\n<p>About that …</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683640 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-768x329.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Jonathan Majors Could Be Both Immortus and Kang</h2>\n<p>Immortus didn&#8217;t wear a mask, just a funny hat, purple cape, and green robes. Majors doesn&#8217;t have the hat but he does have the cape and colors. He immediately makes an impression as a much zanier, more vamping Immortus or Kang than we ever saw in the comics. At one point, he even jumps up on a piece of furniture like he&#8217;s Tom Cruise on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;m a disappointment,&#8221; he says. It&#8217;s as if he&#8217;s reading the minds of hardcore Kang fans, who might be disappointed to see yet another classic Marvel villain rendered maskless in the MCU. Daniel Bruhl&#8217;s Baron Zemo did finally don his ski mask this year in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, but it was only for one scene, and the MCU has a history of leaving the masks off other villains, like the Shocker in <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>. But I digress.</p>\n<p>As his name implies, Kang the Conqueror is a warlord in the comics. He&#8217;s a time-traveler from the year 3000 (we love him 3000?) and Immortus is his older self. The two characters fought on opposite sides in the <em>Avengers Forever</em> mini-series, a series that also notably featured the Time Keepers. Before <em>Loki</em>&#8216;s premiere, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/who-are-the-timekeepers/\">we speculated</a>, based on the first two episodes, that the show could be &#8220;grafting part of the comics story of Kang and Immortus onto <em>Loki</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That is exactly what it has done. In the same article linked above, we also speculated that the Time Keepers could be major power players in the MCU going forward. As it turns out, the joke was on us there: the Time Keepers were nothing more than &#8220;robotic puppets,&#8221; as <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/loki-he-who-remains-jonathan-majors\">Marvel.com</a> calls them. He Who Remains was the one pulling the strings. That major power player the show was setting up was, well, Jonathan Majors&#8217; Kang. <em>Loki</em> does utilize more of the comic book backstory for the Time Keepers, however, when it takes us into the aforementioned Citadel at the End of Time and introduces us to the first and last Time Keeper.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-683673 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Kang-Statue-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Kang-Statue-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Kang-Statue-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Kang-Statue-768x329.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Kang Could Also Open the Door to the Fantastic Four</h2>\n<p>In <em>Loki</em>, we&#8217;ve now seen multiple variants of the god of mischief, including <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/alligator-loki/\">an alligator</a>. The info dump that He Who Remains delivers in the season finale (can we just call him Kang, for the sake of convenience?) reveals that there have been other, more dangerous variants of him, too. This one is the glue holding together the Sacred Timeline, and if Sylvie kills him, which she does, it could open the door to a whole universe (multiverse?) of trouble in the form of other Kangs.</p>\n<p>In the comics, another version of Kang goes by the name of Nathaniel Richards. That&#8217;s not the same Nathaniel Richards who is the grandfather of Reed Richards, AKA Mr. Fantastic, the leader of the Fantastic Four. However, the character could be a descendent of the same man, which would give him a viable connection to Marvel&#8217;s First Family. <em>Spider-Man: Far from Home</em> director Jon Watts is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-fantastic-four-movie/\">already attached</a> to a new Fantastic Four movie from Marvel Studios, so we know the FF is on the way in the MCU. Given the overlap between Kang and the Fantastic Four in the comics, it would make sense for him to help introduce them in the movies.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also Kang&#8217;s status as a Thanos-level threat, someone capable of mucking with the temporal fabric of reality and the fate of all our heroes. Thanos got a post-credits tease in <em>The Avengers</em> back in 2012, and he made an appearance in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> in 2014, but it wasn&#8217;t until six years after his onscreen debut that Marvel Studios finally fleshed him out as a full villain (on his own twisted, genocidal hero&#8217;s quest) in <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>.</p>\n<p>With Majors already locked in for <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania </em>in 2023, it&#8217;s probably safe to expect that Kang will have a more active and immediate presence in Phase 4 of the MCU than Thanos did in Phase 2. In the comics, the character also has history with <strong>Gugu</strong> <strong>Mbatha-Raw</strong>&#8216;s character, Ravonna Renslayer. They&#8217;ve been both lovers and enemies, so odds are strong they&#8217;ll be meeting in the movies or the show, too.</p>\n<p><em>Loki</em>&#8216;s season 1 finale sees the Sacred Timeline branching off into a true multiverse (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tag/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/\">of madness</a>). It leaves him marooned in a reality where Mobius (<strong>Owen Wilson</strong>) doesn&#8217;t know who he is, and where the statue of Kang stands in the atrium of the TVA in place of the Time Keepers. Mark that statue and mark its likeness, because it&#8217;s an important new face that you&#8217;ll be seeing more of in the MCU in the years to come.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/who-is-the-loki-villain/\">Who is &#8220;He Who Remains?&#8221; Breaking Down the Bombshell Appearance in the &#8216;Loki&#8217; Season Finale</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Uf01YnVnE3k:XBEjvO8HWOI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Uf01YnVnE3k:XBEjvO8HWOI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Uf01YnVnE3k:XBEjvO8HWOI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Uf01YnVnE3k:XBEjvO8HWOI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Uf01YnVnE3k:XBEjvO8HWOI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Uf01YnVnE3k:XBEjvO8HWOI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Uf01YnVnE3k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:33:22 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217-700x302.jpeg","linkMd5":"877e0126667b221407f23131ac1ca5d4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn29@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-33-39-131_dfd8e2da80d07ba1.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":302,"sourceBytes":24461,"destBytes":11900,"author":"Joshua Meyer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217-700x302.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn29@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-33-39-131_dfd8e2da80d07ba1.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Miss-Minutes-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn83@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-46-702_6c15f32c7c38f450.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn88@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-46-706_1e6e3d72c93f295e.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Kang-Statue-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn80@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-33-47-060_782251b536541b1a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-46-881_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Uf01YnVnE3k:XBEjvO8HWOI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-46-343_b59842e9a83efb06.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-47-600_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Uf01YnVnE3k:XBEjvO8HWOI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-47-475_328d84c6a83c0914.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Uf01YnVnE3k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn91@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-46-665_a1ebe3ec7b848afc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284004433},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","title":"‘Loki’ Finale Reveals Who’s Behind the TVA Curtain – and That Answer Brings Up a ‘Multiverse’ of Questions","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683655","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-683657 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cit1020_106_comp_v005_afa9d2b6-700x294.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cit1020_106_comp_v005_afa9d2b6.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cit1020_106_comp_v005_afa9d2b6-360x151.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The first season of <strong><em>Loki</em></strong> is done.

Then, however, we hear other Avengers saying some of their favorite catchphrases (We hear Steve Rodgers say “I could do this all day,” for example).</p>\n<p>And then things get trippy. We zoom in and out of space and time in a very <em>Doctor Strange</em>-esque manner as quotes from IRL folks like Maya Angelou join the voiceover. Things eventually coalesce into a cosmic ring (AKA The Sacred Timeline) around The Citadel in The Void At The End of Time, and we’re back with our two Lokis (<strong>Tom Hiddleston </strong>and <strong>Sophia Di Martino</strong>).</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-683658 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rns1220_106_comp_v008_6a60bcbd-700x293.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rns1220_106_comp_v008_6a60bcbd.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rns1220_106_comp_v008_6a60bcbd-360x151.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>It Was Miss Minutes All Along</strong></h2>\n<p>Okay, not really. We <em>do</em> see the TVA’s animated clock (voiced by <strong>Tara Strong</strong>) when Sylvie and Loki walk into the Citadel. And in quest-like fashion, tempts our two anti-heroes with whatever their hearts’ desire.</p>\n<p>Miss Minutes also clues us in that there’s one being behind everything, who she ominously calls He Who Remains. (It’s also here where MCU fans start screaming, “It’s Kang the Conqueror!” at their TVs.)</p>\n<p>Sylvie and Loki decline the offer, concluding (correctly, I’d guess) that it was a lie. Or maybe it was a “test” they had to pass? Just like the kids in <em>Willy Wonka</em> went through to see who could take over Wonka’s factory?</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of Willy Wonka vibes going on in this episode. (And Wizard of Oz, but we’ve seen that already in the show.) And that brings us to the MCU’s version of Wonka: He Who Remains, played by <strong>Jonathan Majors</strong>. While the show doesn’t call him Kang the Conqueror, that’s who he is! We know this not only because news of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-3-villain/\">Majors’ casting</a> has been out for months now, but because we get his character’s entire origin story.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-683640\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-768x329.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Let the Exposition Flow</strong></h2>\n<p>Kang (I’m going to call him that because He Who Remains is too pretentious for me, plus it takes too long to type) is a quirky guy. This version of him anyway. It turns out that he’s a human from the 31st century who discovered how to travel between multiverses. Other versions of him figured it out as well, and for a while they all got along.</p>\n<p>And then they didn’t! Some versions of Kang weren’t so nice…they were conquerors even. (In my headcanon, however, one Kang Variant <em>is</em> Willy Wonka. Don’t tell me I’m wrong, let me live with this fictional fiction.) The Kangs started fighting, and we got the Multiversal Wars.</p>\n<p>The Kang talking to Sylvie and Loki explains this all in his wacked out avuncular way (he also has little CGI figurines to help tell the tale), and then he offers the two a golden ticket. <em>They</em> can take over Kang’s job and stave off another Multiversal War from happening. If they did, they’d also have complete power over time and space, something that’d be appealing to many a Loki.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-683659 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217-700x302.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217-360x155.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>&#8220;You Can’t Trust and I Can’t Be Trusted&#8221;</strong></h2>\n<p>Kang lays this all out for Sylvie and Loki just as The Void crosses some threshold and he no longer knows what’s going to happen next. It’s here where we get the only major emotional moment of the episode (except for a short one between <strong>Gugu Mbatha-Raw</strong>&#8216;s Ravonna and <strong>Owen Wilson</strong>&#8216;s Mobius).</p>\n<p>This scene <em>is</em> moving — Di Martino and Hiddleston deftly convey how they care for each other, even if their respective Loki traits threaten to create a rift between them.</p>\n<p>It’s also not enough for me — so much of the series up to this point has been about these two characters and how they’ve grown and found a connection with each other. This finale veers away from that, something that’s arguably necessary given it has to set up whatever is coming in <em>Multiverse of Madness</em>. And the ultimate rift between the two — Sylvie sends Loki back to the TVA and kills Kang — also sets up good character fodder for the second season, so there’s that.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-683635\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Finale-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Finale-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Finale-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Finale-768x329.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Loki? What’s a Loki?</strong></h2>\n<p>After Sylvie successfully and anti-climatically kills Kang, the multiverse falls into madness! Just as this version of Kang warned, millions of branches pop up, causing million of versions of himself to wreak havoc across space and time.</p>\n<p>Back at the TVA, Loki desperately tries to find his friends and tell him what’s happened. He finds Mobius and B-15 (<strong>Wunmi Mosaku</strong>) and frantically explains everything. Mobius and B-15, however, give him blank stares: they have no idea who Loki is. That means that they not only don’t know this version of Loki, but any of the other Variants.</p>\n<p>The scene then cuts to one of the TVA’s monolith statues. The image isn’t one of the fake Time-Keepers — it’s Kang himself. The TVA’s timeline has veered off course, and only Loki, it seems, remembers how things were.</p>\n<p>That’s not <em>entirely</em> true. Sylvie likely still knows what’s up. And then Ravonna is also out there somewhere trying to “find free will” after she spared Mobius’ life and took a time portal to somewhere/when unknown, though my guess is it’s someplace with a less-evil version of Kang. (Side note: Ravonna being a school principal on Earth fits <em>perfectly</em> with her character.)</p>\n<p>And there we leave it! Lots of questions, but also the promise of a season 2 in a brief post-credit moment. Over six episodes, <em>Loki</em> accomplished a lot, and I’m not just talking about making a push for a Josta soda comeback.</p>\n<p>We got to delve deep into one of Marvel’s bad/not-so-great guys, and we also got the joy that is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/alligator-loki/\">Alligator Loki</a> and <strong>Richard E. Grant</strong> in a Classic Loki suit. What a vast place the MCU is, and what characters live within it. I can’t wait to see more of them as Phase 4 rolls out.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>All six episodes of the first season of <em>Loki</em> are now streaming on Disney+.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-finale-review/\">&#8216;Loki&#8217; Finale Reveals Who&#8217;s Behind the TVA Curtain – and That Answer Brings Up a &#8216;Multiverse&#8217; of Questions</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=klmfF5YnCTU:AcfUG7WjGLA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=klmfF5YnCTU:AcfUG7WjGLA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=klmfF5YnCTU:AcfUG7WjGLA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=klmfF5YnCTU:AcfUG7WjGLA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=klmfF5YnCTU:AcfUG7WjGLA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=klmfF5YnCTU:AcfUG7WjGLA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/klmfF5YnCTU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:09:30 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cit1020_106_comp_v005_afa9d2b6-700x294.jpeg","linkMd5":"d7bfcdc4dcb652bc908ce399160575f3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn36@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-33-41-152_a11daeed425e256e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":294,"sourceBytes":21083,"destBytes":9964,"author":"Vanessa Armstrong","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cit1020_106_comp_v005_afa9d2b6-700x294.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn36@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-33-41-152_a11daeed425e256e.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/rns1220_106_comp_v008_6a60bcbd-700x293.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn59@2020_1/2021/07/14/17-33-59-537_3e63d41e36aacc9c.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Season-1-Finale-Jonathan-Majors-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn88@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-46-706_1e6e3d72c93f295e.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/arc-106-18739_r2_12f8915f-e1626270910217-700x302.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn29@2020_5/2021/07/14/17-33-39-131_dfd8e2da80d07ba1.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Loki-Finale-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-43-127_4590f8264dc22e75.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_4/2021/07/14/17-33-46-881_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=klmfF5YnCTU:AcfUG7WjGLA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn16@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-33-46-393_6236d82200863251.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/14/17-33-47-600_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=klmfF5YnCTU:AcfUG7WjGLA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn44@2020_2/2021/07/14/17-33-46-952_2dc2d4ec9fa92fc1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/klmfF5YnCTU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn64@2020_3/2021/07/14/17-33-46-528_cb0220895a08fa8d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626284004433},{"createdTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","updatedTime":"2021-07-15 01:33:24","title":"Nicolas Cage Won’t be Adding Joe Exotic to His Roster of Memeable Roles as ‘Tiger King’ Series Gets Shelved","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=683733","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-616032 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Nicolas-Cage-Tiger-King-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Nicolas Cage Tiger King\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Nicolas-Cage-Tiger-King.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Nicolas-Cage-Tiger-King-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>You win some and you lose some and, in this case, we&#8217;re very much chalking this up to a win. For those of us who die on the hill that <strong>Nicolas Cage</strong> is an immensely talented actor (watch <em><strong>Leaving Las Vegas</strong></em>, to remind yourselves!) whose almost inhuman energy should not be wasted, we&#8217;re not <em>too</em> sad to report that Cage won&#8217;t be joining Amazon&#8217;s Joe Exotic series <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/nicolas-cage-tiger-king/\">as previously reported</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-683733\"></span></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/nicolas-cage-joe-exotic-amazon-series-1235019225/\">Variety</a>, the project has been placed on the shelf and may be shopped around to other outlets. Meanwhile, Cage himself broke the news that he is no longer attached to the role, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We should clear the record. I read two excellent scripts, which I did think were excellent, but I think Amazon ultimately felt that it was material that had become past tense because it took so long for it come together. They felt at one point that it was lightning in a bottle, but that point has since faded into the distance and it’s no longer relevant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That makes a lot of sense and, honestly, it&#8217;s kind of refreshing to hear an actor just come out and say that a once-exciting idea was little more than a momentary fad. Obviously capitalizing on Netflix&#8217;s flash-in-the-pan success with their <em><strong>Tiger King</strong></em> documentary, this project was meant to focus on the eccentric man at the center of the wildly popular show, as opposed to its revolving door of unconventional side characters.</p>\n<p>On the surface, at least, I suppose Cage made for a decently obvious casting choice for the wild zookeeper. But to me, it always seemed a poor fit to me and beneath the actor, somehow. This was always a project that needed Nicolas Cage more than Nicolas Cage needed it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-512354 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandy-box-office-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mandy box office\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandy-box-office-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandy-box-office-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandy-box-office-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandy-box-office.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Man, The Myth, The Cage</h2>\n<p>But not to worry, folks, because the Cage train simply does not stop.

And in an effort to compete with each other and woo subscribers, those services have been looking to acquire companies that would help them expand their libraries.

The moviegoing terrain has changed considerably since then, with the coronavirus shuttering theaters and bringing the industry closer to the feared &#8220;implosion&#8221; that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/steven-spielberg-and-george-lucas-predict-hollywood-implosion-look-towards-tv/\">spoke of back in 2013</a>. With the pandemic-best box office <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-widow-box-office-pandemic-record/\">success of <em>Black Widow</em></a>, there&#8217;s every sign now that things are rebounding, but for the time being, at least, that movie and most other new releases are still following the simultaneous theatrical and digital <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/warner-bros-2021/\">release strategy of Warner Bros.</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-638085 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/On-the-Rocks-film-still-Sofia-Coppola-1-1600x900-c-default-e1600949430660-700x320.jpeg\" alt=\"on the rocks review\" width=\"700\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/On-the-Rocks-film-still-Sofia-Coppola-1-1600x900-c-default-e1600949430660-700x320.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/On-the-Rocks-film-still-Sofia-Coppola-1-1600x900-c-default-e1600949430660-360x165.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/On-the-Rocks-film-still-Sofia-Coppola-1-1600x900-c-default-e1600949430660-768x351.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/On-the-Rocks-film-still-Sofia-Coppola-1-1600x900-c-default-e1600949430660.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>What Makes A24 Unique</h2>\n<p>We recently talked about the A24 brand <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lamb-trailer-noomi-rapace/\">in relation to horror</a>. The studio is known for its innovative marketing, like binding the 150-tweet thread that inspired <em>Zola</em> into a <a href=\"https://shop.a24films.com/products/the-story-by-aziah-king\">clothbound hardcover</a>. It&#8217;s also known for its spooky trailers, some of which have been slightly misleading, setting up audiences (and disgruntled CinemaScore responders) <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/it-comes-at-night-trailer/\">with monster-movie expectations</a>, when they were really about to experience <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/it-comes-at-night-misleading-trailer/\">a slow-burn psychodrama</a>. We should have known what to expect by the time <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hereditary-trailer/\"><em>Hereditary</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/midsommar-trailer-new/\"><em>Midsommar</em></a> rolled around, but alas.</p>\n<p>Of course, A24 isn&#8217;t only an indie-horror boutique. It&#8217;s also responsible for &#8220;sci-fi caviar&#8221; (as iTunes likes to package it) such as <em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>High Life</em>, and <em>Under the Skin</em>. In addition, the studio has received dozens of Oscar nominations for films like <em>Room </em>and a big Best Picture win in 2018 with <em>Moonlight</em>.</p>\n<p>Per Variety, the move to potentially sell is one that has been going on under the radar for the last year and a half, yet the trade cites sources within the studio that say A24 is now &#8220;focused on expansion and is not prioritizing a sale.&#8221; We often hear rumblings of this kind right before the deals go through, so if one does happen soon, what would A24 look like under a major media company? Would it get swallowed up or might it prosper in new ways?</p>\n<p>The studio already has an <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/apple-a24-deal/\">existing deal</a> with Apple, which has debuted Sofia Coppola&#8217;s <em>On the Rocks</em> and other films as Apple TV+ exclusives.

Alternatively, its niche appeal might get lost in the sea of subscription options and we may see the edges of a unique studio sanded off.

Burnham did the entire thing himself, that&#8217;s what. Over the course of a year during the coronavirus pandemic, he wrote, recorded, and edited together a musical comedy special that is both heartbreaking and hilarious. The entire special takes place in the one room, and we see Burnham as he processes everything. His hair and beard grow longer, the dark circles under his eyes get darker, and we watch as a man basically has an extended existential crisis. An entire historically horrific year is compressed into 90 minutes, an experience that occasionally feels like a complete nervous breakdown.</p>\n<p>Every element of <em>Inside</em> is excellent on a technical level as well as an artistic level. Burnham manages to make the one-room location into so much more through the use of a projector, lighting, and props. It would be easy to set up a single camera and just let it roll, but he uses multiple angles and a variety of cuts to make a visually cohesive, emotionally resonant work of art. On top of the writing, cinematography, and editing, the songs are absolute bangers.
