Designed originally for applications that rely on SMB file shares, Azure Files lets organizations move apps to the cloud without implementing Windows Server in a virtual machine (VM). Azure File Sync is a complimentary service that synchronizes file shares, leaving on-premises Windows Server file servers to act as a fast, local cache.</p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">Just like Windows Server SMB file shares, shares created in Azure Files can be assigned permissions. Before you can assign permissions, you must use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Azure AD Domain Services to configure <em><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-active-directory-integration-for-smb-access-now-in-public-preview/\" class=\"user-content_link link \" rel=\"noopener\">Azure AD authentication over SMB</a></em>. <em>Active Directory authentication for Azure Files</em>, which entered public preview earlier in 2020, lets users authenticated by Windows Server Active Directory mount file shares.</p> \n <div class=\"ad icpb\" align=\"center\"> \n  <!-- /1030620/in_content_premium_block --> \n  <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-138274153973-0\"> \n   <script> googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-138274153973-0'); }); </script> \n  </div> \n </div> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">For more information on <em>Active Directory authentication for Azure Files</em>, check out my article here on <a href=\"https://petri.com/active-directory-authentication-for-azure-files-enters-public-preview\" class=\"user-content_link link \" rel=\"noopener\">Petri</a>.</p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">Several new Azure Files features went into public preview earlier this year to help organizations move file shares to the cloud with confidence. Until recently, concerns about the ability to recover data in Azure Files were often a showstopper for customers reliant on Windows Server.</p> <h2 class=\"user-content_title title -h2 \">Soft delete acts as a Recycle Bin for file shares</h2> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">Microsoft introduced a new feature in preview called soft delete, which acts like a Recycle Bin for file shares. If a file share is deleted, it is put into a ‘soft deleted’ state. You can set how log soft-deleted file shares remain recoverable. Accidentally deleted files should be restored from snapshot backups (see below).\n  <div class=\"widget_content ad mobile-insert\"> \n   <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1522428278339-12\"> \n    <script> googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1522428278339-12'); }); </script> \n   </div>\n  </div></p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">File shares that have been soft deleted must be undeleted before you can mount them or view their contents. When a soft-deleted share is undeleted, it is restored with all its metadata and snapshots. Microsoft says that soft delete is currently turned off by default for new and existing Azure storage accounts. But later this year, it plans to enable soft delete by default.</p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">Soft delete will be enabled automatically for customers using Azure Backup protected instances.</p> <h2 class=\"user-content_title title -h2 \">Users with Azure Files shares mounted in Windows can use Previous Versions to restore items</h2> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">Using Azure Backup, you can restore files, folders, and shares in the Azure Portal. Customers without Azure Backup can manually restore items from snapshots. Users with Azure Files shares mounted in Windows can use the Previous Versions API to restore items without intervention from IT. AzCopy, version 10.4 or later, and Robocopy can also be used to restore data from snapshots.</p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">But the simplest way to restore data is to mount a snapshot and paste the items back to the primary file share. Customers using Azure File Sync can also use Windows Server Volume Shadow copy Service (VSS) snapshots with the Previous Versions API in Windows. Although VSS isn’t a replacement for backups of your shares in the cloud.</p> <h2 class=\"user-content_title title -h2 \">Microsoft is working on providing GRS and GZRS for standard file shares up to 100TiB</h2> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">Azure Storage redundancy options, which protect data against things like hardware failures and power outages, also apply to Azure Files shares. All shares can use locally-redundant (LRS) or zone-redundant storage (ZRS) options. Geo-redundant (GRS) and geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) are currently only available for standard file shares under 5TB. Microsoft is working on providing GRS and GZRS for standard file shares up to 100TiB.\n  <div class=\"widget_content ad mobile-insert\"> \n   <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1522428278339-22\"> \n    <script> googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1522428278339-22'); }); </script> \n   </div>\n  </div></p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">If you are using Azure Premium Files, which is optimized for performance using solid-state drives (SSD), you’ll need to perform some acrobatics to get geographic redundancy. Microsoft suggests using Azure File Sync to synchronize your Azure Files share to a mounted file share running on a virtual machine in another Azure region. AzCopy and Robocopy can also be used to copy data to a storage account in another Azure region.</p> <h2 class=\"user-content_title title -h2 \">Identity-based authentication and access control over SMB</h2> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">In addition to providing superuser permissions to anyone with a storage account key, Azure Files supports identity-based authentication and access control over SMB using Windows Server AD or Azure AD Domain Services. Share-level permissions can be assigned using Azure AD users and groups via role-based access control (RBAC). Folder and file level permissions can be access control lists (ACL) copied across from Windows Server. Azure Files supports preserving, inheriting, and enforcing Windows Server ACLs.</p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">&nbsp;</p> \n <div class=\"newsletter mobile-insert\"> \n  <div class=\"newsletter__header\">\n   <h3 class=\"newsletter__title\"><span class=\"supertitle\">Subscribe to Petri Newsletters</span>Office 365 Insider</h3>\n  </div> \n  <div class=\"newsletter__content \" data-hsPortalID=\"2512652\" data-hsFormID=\"9171b650-a314-42d8-911d-df9b39ee0fb5\" data-hsPropertyName=\"subs_o365ins\"> \n   <div class=\"newsletter__form\"> \n    <p class=\"newsletter__desc\">\n     <div>\n      Our Petri Office 365 Insider is dedicated to sharing detailed knowledge from top Office 365 experts.

But today, the company is announcing that they are bringing transcription to Word.</p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">The new feature is about as simple as it sounds, you can now record and upload audio conversations to Word (on the web) and have the data transcribed. Once transcribed, the content is shown in the side panel of the Word window and allows you to review and insert the text into your document.</p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">There are a couple of limitations that you should know about including that as of the time of this post, this feature only works for the web version of Word but it will be coming soon to mobile devices as well. Other limitations include that you must have an active Microsoft 365 subscription and there is a limit of 5hrs of transcribed data per month along with a max upload file size of 200mb.</p> \n <div class=\"image-expand aligncenter\" data-expand=\"https://petri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/GIF_Transcribe_Audio-upload.gif\"> \n  <figure id=\"post-652073\" class=\"user-content_figure figure align-aligncenter\">\n   <img alt=\"\" data-normal=\"https://petri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/GIF_Transcribe_Audio-upload.gif\" class=\"_js \">\n    <noscript>\n     <img src=\"https://petri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/GIF_Transcribe_Audio-upload.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n    </noscript></img>\n  </figure> \n </div> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">This feature is going to be quite helpful for teachers, journalists, and many others who need to quickly turn audio recordings into text. For example, we transcribe podcasts here on Petri using a third-party service but now can use Word to accomplish this task. But, at 5hrs of transcription allowed per month, we may hit that limit quickly but for others who infrequently need this type of functionality, this is a quality update for Word.</p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">Initially, only English will be supported with this feature but other languages will eventually be added to the service.\n  <div class=\"widget_content ad mobile-insert\"> \n   <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1522428278339-22\"> \n    <script> googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1522428278339-22'); }); </script> \n   </div>\n  </div></p> <p class=\"user-content_text text \">While this feature is not ‘free’, considering that most companies are already paying for some sort of Microsoft 365 subscription, many users should be able to access this functionality for no additional cost. But, keep in mind that it only works with Word on the web, hopefully but hopefully this feature arrives in the desktop app in the near future.</p> \n <div class=\"newsletter mobile-insert\"> \n  <div class=\"newsletter__header\">\n   <h3 class=\"newsletter__title\"><span class=\"supertitle\">Subscribe to Petri Newsletters</span>Office 365 Insider</h3>\n  </div> \n  <div class=\"newsletter__content \" data-hsPortalID=\"2512652\" data-hsFormID=\"9171b650-a314-42d8-911d-df9b39ee0fb5\" data-hsPropertyName=\"subs_o365ins\"> \n   <div class=\"newsletter__form\"> \n    <p class=\"newsletter__desc\">\n     <div>\n      Our Petri Office 365 Insider is dedicated to sharing detailed knowledge from top Office 365 experts.
