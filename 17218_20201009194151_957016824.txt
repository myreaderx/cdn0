In the research, Keen Security Lab performed an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of both hardware and software on in-vehicle infotainment Head Unit, Telematics Control Unit and Central Gateway Module of multiple BMW vehicles. Through mainly focusing on various external attack surfaces, (including GSM network, BMW Remote Service, BMW ConnectedDrive System, Remote Diagnosis, NGTP protocol, Bluetooth protocol, USB and OBD-II interfaces), Keen Security Lab has gained local and remote access to infotainment components, T-Box components and UDS communication above certain speed of selected multiple BMW vehicle modules and been able to gain control of the CAN buses with the execution of arbitrary, unauthorized diagnostic requests of BMW in-car systems remotely.<br><a id=\"more\"></a></br></p> \n<h2 id=\"Vulnerability-Findings\"><a href=\"http://keenlab.tencent.com/2018/05/22/New-CarHacking-Research-by-KeenLab-Experimental-Security-Assessment-of-BMW-Cars/#Vulnerability-Findings\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Vulnerability Findings\"></a>Vulnerability Findings</h2> \n<p>After conducting the intensive security analysis of multiple BMW cars’ electronic control units, Keen Security Lab has found 14 vulnerabilities with local and remote access vectors in BMW connected cars. And 7 of these vulnerabilities were assigned CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) numbers.<br>All the following vulnerabilities and CVEs have been confirmed by BMW after we submitted the full report and collaborated with them on technical details:<br><img src=\"http://keenlab.tencent.com/en/img/New-CarHacking-Research-by-KeenLab-Experimental-Security-Assessment-of-BMW-Cars/Vulnerabilities_and_CVEs_in_Our_Research_Confirmed_by_BMW.jpg\" alt=\"Table: Vulnerabilities and CVEs in Our Research Confirmed by BMW\" /></br></br></p> \n<h2 id=\"Attack-Chains\"><a href=\"http://keenlab.tencent.com/2018/05/22/New-CarHacking-Research-by-KeenLab-Experimental-Security-Assessment-of-BMW-Cars/#Attack-Chains\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Attack Chains\"></a>Attack Chains</h2> \n<p>In our research, we have already found some ways to influence the vehicle via different kinds of attack chains by sending arbitrary diagnostic messages to electronic control units. Since we were able to gain access to the head unit and telematics control unit, these attack chains are aimed to implement an arbitrary diagnostic message transmission through Central Gateway Module in order to impact or control electronic control units on different CAN buses (e.g. PT-CAN, K-CAN, etc..).<br><img src=\"http://keenlab.tencent.com/en/img/New-CarHacking-Research-by-KeenLab-Experimental-Security-Assessment-of-BMW-Cars/Local_Attack_Chain.png\" alt=\"Figure: Local Attack Chain\" /></br></p> \n<p><img src=\"http://keenlab.tencent.com/en/img/New-CarHacking-Research-by-KeenLab-Experimental-Security-Assessment-of-BMW-Cars/Remote_Attack_Chain.png\" alt=\"Figure: Remote Attack Chain\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"Vulnerable-BMW-Models\"><a href=\"http://keenlab.tencent.com/2018/05/22/New-CarHacking-Research-by-KeenLab-Experimental-Security-Assessment-of-BMW-Cars/#Vulnerable-BMW-Models\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Vulnerable BMW Models\"></a>Vulnerable BMW Models</h2> \n<p>In our research, the vulnerabilities we found mainly exist in the Head Unit, Telematics Control Unit (TCB), and Central Gateway Module. Based on our research experiments, we can confirm that the vulnerabilities existed in Head Unit would affect several BMW models, including BMW i Series, BMW X Series, BMW 3 Series, BMW 5 Series, BMW 7 Series. And the vulnerabilities existed in Telematics Control Unit (TCB) would affect the BMW models which equipped with this module produced from year 2012.<br>Table below lists the vulnerable BMW models we’ve tested during our research and each with its firmware versions of the specific components.<br><img src=\"http://keenlab.tencent.com/en/img/New-CarHacking-Research-by-KeenLab-Experimental-Security-Assessment-of-BMW-Cars/Vulnerable_BMW_models_in_our_test.jpg\" alt=\"Table: Vulnerable BMW models in our test\" /></br></br></p> \n<p>As different BMW car models may be equipped with different components, and even the same component may have different firmware versions during the product lifecycle. So that from our side the scope of the vulnerable car models is hard to be precisely confirmed. Theoretically, BMW models which are equipped with these vulnerable components could be compromised from our perspective if the corrective measures had not already been effectively implemented by BMW.</p> \n<p>BMW confirmed, that the found vulnerabilities are present in the infotainment and T-Box components mentioned above. Updates have already been developed and implemented by BMW (see below).</p> \n<h2 id=\"Disclosure-Timeline\"><a href=\"http://keenlab.tencent.com/2018/05/22/New-CarHacking-Research-by-KeenLab-Experimental-Security-Assessment-of-BMW-Cars/#Disclosure-Timeline\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Disclosure Timeline\"></a>Disclosure Timeline</h2> \n<p>The research to BMW cars is an ethical hacking research project.
