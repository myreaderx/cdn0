My. Word. This is just the tip of the absolutely breathtaking iceberg that is the work of New York based artist and educator <a href=\"https://beverlysemmesstudio.com/\">Beverly Semmes</a>. She’s a sculptor who incorporates painting, film, photography and performance so, yes, her portfolio is immense. That said, I clearly have a thing for her series of large-scale dresses that flow across the floor, filling entire rooms! She became known for these works in the 1990’s, but if you keep an eye out you can still find recent additions to the series <em>{ie., the piece at the top, titled “Bow (Blue Curtain)”, is from 2016.} </em>This is how Beverly describes these installations:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Imposing and majestic, the dresses cascade down walls, conjuring wearers of power and size.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>So powerful. Just imagine seeing that pink piece <em>{complete with wearer!}</em>, titled “Petunia, 2002”, in person? Majestic, indeed.</p>\n<h5>*Images found via <a href=\"https://www.inglettgallery.com/\">Susan Inglett Gallery</a> &#38; <a href=\"http://shoshanawayne.com/\">Shoshana Wayne Gallery</a>.</h5>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 08:00:53 +0000","feedId":16219,"bgimg":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/beverlysemmes584-1.jpg","linkMd5":"beeb1b829a914d7d5fbf34c13245b30b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2021/09/30/16-15-54-203_2f5f55a65800aec6.webp","destWidth":584,"destHeight":3616,"sourceBytes":1631027,"destBytes":249196,"author":"the jealous curator","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/beverlysemmes584-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2021/09/30/16-15-54-203_2f5f55a65800aec6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633018547310}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-10-01 00:15:47","updatedTime":"2021-10-01 00:15:47","feedId":16219,"fetchDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 16:15:47 +0000","fetchMs":10615,"handleMs":12585,"totalMs":30632,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"f306b40366a93aa712f78b685bea0f01","hostName":"us-025*","requestId":"dc49b12f3fad4478b618e3e901667b19_16219","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":249196,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx10":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:12:21","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 13:30:53","id":16219,"name":"The Jealous Curator","url":"http://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/feed/","subscriber":206,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":249196,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1633018524093,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":10632,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":12585,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/beverlysemmes584-1.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":584,"destHeight":3616,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_1/2021/09/30/16-15-54-203_2f5f55a65800aec6.webp","sourceBytes":1631027,"destBytes":249196,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":16219,"totalSpendMs":7272,"convertSpendMs":132,"createdTime":"2021-10-01 00:15:47","host":"europe63*","referer":"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/?p=38232","linkMd5ListStr":"beeb1b829a914d7d5fbf34c13245b30b,beeb1b829a914d7d5fbf34c13245b30b","githubUser":"myreaderx10","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"1.6 MB","destSize":"243.4 KB","compressRate":"15.3%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx10":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
