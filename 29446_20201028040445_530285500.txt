The veterinarian thinks she’s a Walker Hound and Beagle mix, though, as she has characteristics of both breeds.</p>\n <p><b>What do you love most about your pet?</b>&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Floppy Ears gives me unconditional love that makes everything in my world better. She’s excellent company too and is always up for a walk, play or cuddle.</p>\n <p><b>What makes Floppy Ears happy?</b></p>\n <p>Like most dogs (and hounds in particular) Floppy Ears is very food motivated so mealtime is always a source of happiness! More seriously, though, she’s a loving family dog so is happiest being with her family whether that’s lounging at home, playing with toys, out on a walk or going for a ride in the car.</p>\n <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZabpwPfx9_4/X5OZvSibcRI/AAAAAAAAGIA/1VyRIYMX_BMNXjfTOA3yOt7WnI4Sln33QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Jen-Gilroy-dog-sleeping.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img alt=\"Romance writer Jen Gilroy's dog sleeping: The Writer's Pet\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"206\" data-original-width=\"320\" height=\"258\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZabpwPfx9_4/X5OZvSibcRI/AAAAAAAAGIA/1VyRIYMX_BMNXjfTOA3yOt7WnI4Sln33QCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h258/Jen-Gilroy-dog-sleeping.jpg\" title=\"The Writer's Pet: Jen Gilroy, her dog, and A Wish in Irish Falls\" width=\"400\" /></a></td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo: Jen Gilroy</td>\n   </tr>\n  </tbody>\n </table>\n <p><br /></p>\n <p><b>Does your pet help or hinder your writing?

She snoozes in her bed by my desk as I work toward my daily word count, is always happy to go for a walk when I need to take a break to solve a tricky plot problem, and often features in my social media posts.

Although it’s the second book in a series, it can also be read as a standalone story.</p>\n <p>Both grieving losses, Tara, the bakery owner heroine who is a military widow, and Walker, the veterinarian hero who is new in town, aren’t looking for love. But with a little wishing tree magic, a special tree believed to make wishes come true, and a stray dog who brings them together, Tara and Walker might just find second chances in life, as well as love, family and community.</p>\n <p><b>What role do animals play in your fiction?</b></p>\n <p>Each of my books includes animal characters, usually dogs and cats as both have been important in my life. As in <i>A Wish in Irish Falls</i> where a dog brings the hero and heroine together, animals help characters grow and change and often (thanks to their unconditional love and lack of judgment) help characters learn to trust in themselves and others again.</p>\n <p><br /></p>\n <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-family: georgia; font-size: large;\">\"I call Floppy Ears my “author assistant” because she’s a huge and helpful part of my writing life.\"</span></p>\n <p><br /></p>\n <p><b>What do you want readers to take away from your books?</b></p>\n <p>I write the kind of books I enjoy reading and I’m delighted when readers describe them as heartwarming stories filled with emotion that make their hearts happy.
