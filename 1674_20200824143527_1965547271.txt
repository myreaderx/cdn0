The national study included data for patients 65 and older who were hospitalized for a reason besides a fall.</p>\n<p>They found that fall risk jumps about 33% per week in the month before hospitalization. This spike is much higher (310% per week in the month prior to hospitalization) for patients who also fell while in the hospital. For those patients, risk decreases only 4% per week after discharge.</p>\n<p>One of the big implications of the findings is that patients bring a lot of fall risk into the hospital, and so it&#8217;s even more imperative that hospitals provide better in-hospital as well as discharge <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/virtual-reality-falls-elderly-1407522/\">fall-prevention</a> efforts, Hoffman says.</p>\n<p>Although fall injuries are among the costliest diagnoses in Medicare, little has been done to partner hospitals with other care providers along the care continuum, he says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know that care coordination is critical for helping patients manage risk. But when it comes to falls—a primary indicator of function—our system typically interacts with patients after an injury and isn&#8217;t broadly successful at managing risk proactively or longer term, or assigning interdisciplinary teams to patients moving through various parts of the health care system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Falls can prove fatal for older adults. Every year, about one-third of older Americans fall, and 10-15% get injured.</p>\n<p>Both fatal and nonfatal injuries have increased and will likely keep rising given the burgeoning older adult population, Hoffman says. Medicare spends $15 billion to $35 billion annually on fall injury treatment.</p>\n<p>Fall risk naturally increases with age but that doesn&#8217;t have to mean a loss of independence, Hoffman says. With preparation, older adults and caregivers can reduce risk and negative outcomes associated with falls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All activities come with risk, and it’s important to maintain independence,&#8221; Hoffman says. &#8220;The best way to do that is to be cognizant of <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/sleep-medications-adults-falls-1569912/\">fall risks</a>—environmental safety hazards, issues with mobility—and, if comfortable, aim to do something about them. Find a yoga class, work on muscle strengthening and flexibility.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not all falls are dangerous, and families can help determine the proper tradeoff between risk and independence, he says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It might be worth being more active even if fall risk slightly increases, as long as the older adult is comfortable with that risk,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://news.umich.edu/balancing-act-falls-are-often-early-signal-of-underlying-health-problems-in-older-adults/\">University of Michigan</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org/older-adults-fall-risk-hospitals-2427262/\">Fall risk rises for older adults before and after hospitalization</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org\">Futurity</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:21:35 +0000","feedId":1674,"bgimg":"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/older-adults-falls_1600-770x440.jpg","linkMd5":"d133dad89d8c85c5605e59a9d86bbdc4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn21@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-35-24-449_d26ca2af086f9533.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":94989,"destBytes":75050,"author":"Laura Bailey-Michigan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/older-adults-falls_1600-770x440.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn21@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-35-24-449_d26ca2af086f9533.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279656862},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","title":"‘SMILES’ are the brightest fluorescent materials ever","link":"https://www.futurity.org/?p=2426062","description":"<img width=\"640\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smiles-fluorescent-materials_1600-770x440.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Hands hold 3 different colored SMILES fluorescent materials, one glowing green, one blue, and one pink\" style=\"padding:0 0 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smiles-fluorescent-materials_1600-770x440.jpg 770w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smiles-fluorescent-materials_1600-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smiles-fluorescent-materials_1600-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smiles-fluorescent-materials_1600-1536x878.jpg 1536w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smiles-fluorescent-materials_1600.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p>Materials called small-molecule, ionic isolation lattices, or SMILES, are the brightest-known fluorescent materials, researchers report.</p>\n<p>The patent-pending materials could address key setbacks to using fluorescent <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/flurosescent-dye-ocean-microplastics-1613422-2/\">dyes</a> as solid-state materials in academic and commercial applications.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are several commercial applications for SMILES, including medical diagnostics, solar concentrators, lasers, and more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Think of SMILES like a light bulb, but instead of being turned on with electricity, they are turned on with light, including ultraviolet and visible light,&#8221; says Amar Flood, professor of chemistry at Indiana University. &#8220;These SMILES pack a lot of dyes inside a material that can absorb a lot of light and then re-radiate it as light without much loss.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fluorescence is critical to applications in optical materials and polymers including diagnostics, photonics and solar energy,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While fluorescent dyes are potential key components of these materials, electronic coupling between them in the solid state quenches their emission, preventing their reliable use in applications.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The key advancement made with SMILES is their brightness, which contrasts with the quenching of the emission typically seen in other fluorescent materials. Normalized for volume, the SMILES materials operate at 7,000 brightness units, which is the highest-known level.</p>\n<p>Flood says the brightness is the result of the molecular glue that makes the small-molecule dyes stick together in a checkerboard lattice. When the dyes are isolated from one another in the alternating checkerboard pattern, they &#8220;turn on their bright properties,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>The researchers are interested in using the dyes in academic research topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A range of exciting new uses can be envisioned,&#8221; Flood says. &#8220;We will use SMILES in light upconversion, which is considered for <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/solar-energy-femto-second-laser-pulses-black-metal-2272052/\">solar harvesting</a>, and in circularly polarized luminescence needed for 3D displays. We also will use the dyes in switchable materials, which are common to photochromic glass that becomes darker when it is exposed to light or ultraviolet radiation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are several commercial applications for SMILES, including <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/amyloids-alzheimers-disease-1860842/\">medical diagnostics</a>, solar concentrators, lasers, and more,&#8221; Flood says. &#8220;Additionally, SMILES materials are simple to incorporate into commodity products such as polymers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Flood disclosed his discovery to the Indiana University&#8217;s Innovation and Commercialization Office, which has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

These signals act like a kind of early warning system, allowing the surviving bacterial cells to prepare a type of <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/antibiotic-resistance-multi-drug-resistance-2350722/\">resistance</a> to antibiotics.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Interfering with necrosignaling should enhance the efficacy of antibiotics and reduce the occurrence of drug-resistant strains.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The process of necrosignaling is outlined in a new paper in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17709-0\"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Bacterial swarms occur when certain types of bacteria, like <em>E. coli</em>, band together by the billions and use their whip-like flagella to move as one over a solid surface.</p>\n<p>Scientists have previously observed that these swarms are more resistant to antibiotics and knew that dead bacteria provide nutrients to surviving bacteria in the swarm. However, this is the first time researchers have uncovered an active signal.</p>\n<p>Rasika Harshey, professor of microbiology at the University of Texas at Austin, and her team observed almost a decade ago that when bacterial swarms moved into an area treated with antibiotics, about 25% of the cells in the swarm died. They wondered if this massive cell death was altruistic in actually helping the community as a whole survive.</p>\n<p>The results in the new paper show that this is true. As they died, the cells released a protein that would bind to the surface of the surviving bacterial cells. This acted like a signal, letting survivors in the bacterial swarm know to start pumping the antibiotic out of the cells using specialized molecular machines called efflux pumps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While this resistance is physiological, it buys the bacteria time to acquire mutations that would eventually lead to genetic resistance,&#8221; Harshey says.</p>\n<p>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria represent a critical problem in medicine because once a bacterium becomes resistant to several types of antibiotic medications, it becomes incredibly difficult to treat infections in humans and animals.</p>\n<p>By understanding one of the mechanisms by which these hard-to-kill swarms survive contact with antibiotics, scientists may be able to target that process with therapeutic drugs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Interfering with necrosignaling should enhance the efficacy of antibiotics and reduce the occurrence of drug-resistant strains,&#8221; Harshey says.</p>\n<p>Harshey and her team discovered through their research that within the bacterial swarm, a subpopulation of cells appears to be more susceptible to antibiotics, like a kind of bacterial cannon fodder. By developing these different types of cells, the swarm has a better chance of survival than single bacterial cells.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many clinically important bacteria go through phases of their infection cycle outside the host in harsh environments where swarming would increase their chances of acquiring antibiotic resistance through necrosignaling,&#8221; Harshey says. &#8220;With better understanding of this process we may be able to halt it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The National Institutes of Health and the Robert Welch Foundation funded the research.</p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://cns.utexas.edu/news/some-bacteria-sacrifice-themselves-to-protect-their-brethren-from-antibiotics\">UT Austin</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org/bacteria-swarm-cells-death-necrosignaling2426342-2/\">Bacterial cells sacrifice themselves to protect the swarm</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org\">Futurity</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 17:42:29 +0000","feedId":1674,"bgimg":"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bacteria-necrosignaling_1600-770x440.jpg","linkMd5":"0cfae92dd23c4cd51cf219c1f9d5571e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn18@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-35-24-304_878e92309ef60fd1.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":32930,"destBytes":15594,"author":"Esther Robards-Forbes - UT Austin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bacteria-necrosignaling_1600-770x440.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn18@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-35-24-304_878e92309ef60fd1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279656862},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","title":"Awkward glances show your brain can ‘read minds’","link":"https://www.futurity.org/?p=2426012","description":"<img width=\"640\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/averted-gaze-brains-eyes-focus_1600-770x440.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"A young woman looks to her right while against a blue wall\" style=\"padding:0 0 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/averted-gaze-brains-eyes-focus_1600-770x440.jpg 770w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/averted-gaze-brains-eyes-focus_1600-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/averted-gaze-brains-eyes-focus_1600-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/averted-gaze-brains-eyes-focus_1600-1536x878.jpg 1536w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/averted-gaze-brains-eyes-focus_1600.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p>The universal and embarrassing tendency to avert our gaze when we&#8217;re caught looking at someone else could shed light on how our brains derive meaning from a look into another&#8217;s eyes, researchers say.</p>\n<p>In almost all cases, people instinctually follow the gaze of another.</p>\n<p>But in their new study, the researchers found an exception in the socially awkward situation in which a person caught staring averts their eyes: A third-party observer does not reflexively follow their gaze.</p>\n<p>The researchers conclude that the brain tells the observer that there is no significance to the location where the embarrassed party has turned their attention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The brain is a lot smarter than we thought,&#8221;

says Marybec Griffin, assistant professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if the disclosure conversation is successful, many providers lack the knowledge of gay men&#8217;s health issues, which translates to inappropriate screening and prevention service, including the low levels of HPV vaccination and site-specific STI [sexually transmitted infection] testing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The researchers surveyed 800 young <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/gay-men-hiv-cities-1146942-2/\">gay men</a> in New York City between the ages of 18 and 29 who reported their health care usage and satisfaction across three factors: facility type, coordination of health care, and satisfaction with care provided.</p>\n<p>The findings show that the health care system does not fully address the health care needs of gay men.</p>\n<p>Participants who had prior experiences of discrimination in health care settings were less likely to seek care from a single provider and were more likely to be dissatisfied with health care as a result.</p>\n<p>Those who had disclosed their <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/young-men-hpv-risk-2279152/\">sexual orientation</a> and were comfortable discussing sexual activity with their health care provider were more likely to agree that their health care needs were being adequately addressed. Creating safe spaces that encourage disclosure of sexual orientation builds trust between patients and providers and allows for relevant screening and preventive services that young gay men need, researchers found.</p>\n<p>Further, health care cost and convenience play an important role in accessing care. Participants who had a primary care provider were less likely to use walk-in models of health care, such as emergency rooms and urgent care facilities, indicating that once satisfactory care is established, patients will not doctor-shop or use more convenient types of care, allowing an ease of access and more anonymity for STI testing and treatment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As the use of nontraditional health care facilities like urgent care centers increases, it is important that providers in these settings are aware of the health care needs of gay men,&#8221; says Perry N.

The participants were part of the Midlife Development in the US (MIDUS) study, a national longitudinal study of health and well-being in adulthood.</p>\n<p>Participants were given a list of 12 potentially traumatic events and asked if they&#8217;d experienced any, and how negatively they were affected.</p>\n<p>The events on the list included divorce or death of a parent during childhood, emotional or physical <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/domestic-abuse-mortality-risk-2283092-2/\">abuse</a>, parental alcohol or drug addiction, <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/veterans-counseling-therapy-1760452-2/\">combat experience</a>, and losing a home to fire, flood, or natural disaster. For any of these to be considered traumatic, respondents needed to indicate they caused severe emotional distress.</p>\n<p>Researchers also asked subjects a series of questions that tested their cognitive abilities in two areas: executive functioning (EF) and episodic memory (EM). EF pertains to such skills as focusing attention, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. The test of EM involved remembering recently learned information.</p>\n<p>The scientists compared the results of individuals who says they had lived through trauma with those who indicated they hadn&#8217;t and tested their EM and EF over the course of nine years.</p>\n<p>Those respondents who says they had experienced more traumatic events showed greater declines in both EF and EM.</p>\n<p>Lachman says this may be because trauma has been linked to <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/mid-life-stress-women-memory-alzheimers-2127072-2/\">stress</a> and <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/magnetic-brain-stimulation-severe-depression-2328742-2/\">depression</a>, both of which are known to impair cognitive functioning.</p>\n<p>Trauma is also linked to metabolic disease, inflammation, and disruption of the body&#8217;s immune system, which are likewise also known to harm the brain&#8217;s performance.</p>\n<p>Lynch stresses that trauma does not automatically mean an individual will experience greater cognitive impairment in later life. The impact of trauma varies and some people are more resilient or receive treatment that can mitigate the effects.</p>\n<p>Lynch, who is now a PhD student at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, also says the effects of cognitive decline can be subtle and may go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It might not feel like there&#8217;s an effect on your day-to-day functioning,&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p>The researchers also looked at whether childhood or more recent traumatic experiences had a greater effect on cognition. They found that individuals exposed to trauma later in life had a greater decline in EF than individuals whose first traumatic event occurred earlier in life. The amount of decline in EM did not vary based on when the event occurred in life, a finding that the researchers says required further study.</p>\n<p>Lachman speculates there may be more of an opportunity to recover from trauma that occurs years before, in childhood. She says children may be more likely to receive supportive interventions or the increased plasticity of their brains may make them more likely to adapt in the long term.</p>\n<p>The research appears in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22522\"><em>Journal of Traumatic Stress</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.brandeis.edu/now/2020/august/trauma-cognition-lachman.html\">Brandeis University</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org/trauma-cognitive-decline-2426742/\">Trauma may increase cognitive decline with age</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org\">Futurity</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 18:40:36 +0000","feedId":1674,"bgimg":"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/trauma-cognitive-decline-aging_1600-770x440.jpg","linkMd5":"e2b94916aacd636b62e41f4f440061be","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn89@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-35-20-589_905a7ca15ab6c001.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":41724,"destBytes":17294,"author":"Lawrence Goodman-Brandeis","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/trauma-cognitive-decline-aging_1600-770x440.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn89@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-35-20-589_905a7ca15ab6c001.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279656862},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","title":"Family photos at work curb fraud and unethical activity","link":"https://www.futurity.org/?p=2426632","description":"<img width=\"640\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/family-photos-work-fraud-ethics_1600-770x440.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Photos hang on string on a wall\" style=\"padding:0 0 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/family-photos-work-fraud-ethics_1600-770x440.jpg 770w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/family-photos-work-fraud-ethics_1600-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/family-photos-work-fraud-ethics_1600-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/family-photos-work-fraud-ethics_1600-1536x878.jpg 1536w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/family-photos-work-fraud-ethics_1600.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p>Displaying family photos in the workplace cuts down on employee fraud and other unethical behavior, new research finds.</p>\n<p>For instance, in one study the researchers conducted, participants who looked at pictures of family or friends filed expense reports claiming about $8 less on average than workers without pictures. While $8 may not seem like much, it can add up quickly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If numerous employees submit monthly expense reports to a company, it&#8217;s easy to imagine the financial impact of the reduction in <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/air-pollution-unethical-behavior-1675812/\">unethical behavior</a> over time,&#8221; says Ashley Hardin, assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis and the lead author of the paper in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.04.007\"><em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em></a>.</p>\n<p>More than 70% of workers display photos in their workspace, and people have a great deal of choice in what they put up, Hardin says.</p>\n<p>At the same time, companies have considerable influence over whether employees have photos in their workstations by signaling their acceptability.</p>\n<p>The researchers theorized that having photos of &#8220;close others&#8221; in view &#8220;decreases the hegemony of an economic schema in people&#8217;s minds&#8221;—in other words, reduces the prioritization of <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/guilt-proneness-work-1701672/\">self-interest</a>, among other things, which decreases their propensity to misbehave. These hypotheses were supported across four studies they conducted.</p>\n<p>Photos are a cue to the self and others because they convey information about values and interests, previous research found. Until now, however, the effect of personalizing one&#8217;s workplace with photos on financial transgressions like fraud was unexplored.</p>\n<p>The authors conducted a field survey and three experiments; they found a negative relationship between employees who display photos of family or friends at work—rather than photos of landscapes—and <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/cfos-finances-business-fraud-2276882/\">financial transgressions</a>.</p>\n<p>Given the frequency and cost of unethical behavior at work, &#8220;there is great interest in understanding what contributes to these behaviors and how to curb such conduct,&#8221; the authors write.</p>\n<p>The results consistently indicate that the presence of photos of close others—family and friends—reduces the likelihood that individuals will over-report their earnings, pad expense reports, or engage in other bad behavior.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our findings are relevant for individuals at work. For example, individuals who want to guard against their own unethical behavior could display photos of friends and family in their workspaces,&#8221; Hardin says.</p>\n<p>And companies should consider encouraging employees to display photos of family and friends.</p>\n<p>&#8220;More broadly, companies and individuals alike should be mindful of how their physical surroundings may be influencing their behavior,&#8221; the authors write.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whereas some organizations encourage segmentation of work and life by penalizing those who bring outside topics into work, our findings suggest that this segmentation may have an unexpected downside in terms of unethical behavior.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our results suggest that subtle adjustments to the physical context can alter employee behavior, and it should, therefore, be possible to design organizational interventions that help to inhibit fraud and other forms of undesirable behavior.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://source.wustl.edu/2020/08/picture-this-employee-fraud-decreases-when-they-see-family-photos/\">Washington University in St. Louis</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org/family-photos-work-fraud-2426632-2/\">Family photos at work curb fraud and unethical activity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org\">Futurity</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 15:27:39 +0000","feedId":1674,"bgimg":"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/family-photos-work-fraud-ethics_1600-770x440.jpg","linkMd5":"decd2337f043d3ee0c0f550d5c5b09ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn94@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-35-21-152_37d670e4417a34a5.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":67945,"destBytes":35956,"author":"Jill Young Miller-Washington U.","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/family-photos-work-fraud-ethics_1600-770x440.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn94@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-35-21-152_37d670e4417a34a5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279656863},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","title":"Birds sing better with some early morning practice","link":"https://www.futurity.org/?p=2426512","description":"<img width=\"640\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/birds-singing-morning-practice_1600-770x440.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"A swamp sparrow tilts its head back and sings while sitting among bright green leaves\" style=\"padding:0 0 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/birds-singing-morning-practice_1600-770x440.jpg 770w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/birds-singing-morning-practice_1600-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/birds-singing-morning-practice_1600-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/birds-singing-morning-practice_1600-1536x878.jpg 1536w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/birds-singing-morning-practice_1600.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p>There may be a good reason why birds are most vocal at first light, according to new research.</p>\n<p>By singing early and often, birds perform better during the day, a new study suggests.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re warming up backstage, before the sun comes up and the curtain rises.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The morning cacophony is mostly males, whose songs are meant to impress potential <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/bird-bacteria-odor-communication-2196792/\">mates</a> and rivals.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re warming up backstage, before the sun comes up and the curtain rises,&#8221; says coauthor Stephen Nowicki, a biology professor at Duke University.</p>\n<p>Scientists have proposed various hypotheses for why <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/birds-evolution-australia-1237292-2/\">birds</a> do their most vigorous singing in the early morning hours. One idea is that it&#8217;s the best time to broadcast, since there&#8217;s little wind to distort their sound. Others have suggested that the dim light makes it difficult to do much else, like hunt for insects.</p>\n<p>But the new study points to another benefit: the early morning vocal warm-up works wonders for their singing.</p>\n<p>To test the &#8220;warm-up hypothesis,&#8221; Nowicki and biologist Susan Peters recorded 11 male swamp sparrows between 2 AM and noon for two to three mornings each.</p>\n<p>The song of the swamp sparrow is a simple trill of up to five notes, repeated around 5 to 10 times a second. It sounds a bit &#8220;like a melodious police whistle,&#8221; Nowicki says.</p>\n<p>Birdsong may look effortless, but it requires balancing competing demands of speed and dexterity, says first author Jason Dinh, a biology PhD student who did the study while still an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>Birds switch from one note to the next by opening and closing their beaks. To go from low to high and back down again in rapid-fire succession, a bird must precisely coordinate the movements of their beak and voice box with each breath.</p>\n<p>To monitor the birds&#8217; performance, the researchers measured each bird&#8217;s trill rate and vocal range over the course of the morning.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;They&#8217;re able to perform more difficult songs later in the morning.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>For swamp sparrows, the concert can start as early at 2:30 AM. But they don&#8217;t wake up singing like virtuosos, the researchers found.</p>\n<p>Statistical analysis of the recordings revealed that they start off taking it easy; singing slower, or with a more limited range.</p>\n<p>They only start to nail their songs—picking up the tempo and reaching for higher and lower pitch—just after dawn, after hundreds of takes.</p>\n<p>The more they warmed up, the better they got. &#8220;They&#8217;re able to perform more difficult songs later in the morning,&#8221; Dinh says.</p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s hard to make direct comparisons to the physiological effects in humans, Dinh says, the warm-up up may help get their blood flowing and temperature rising to meet the physical demands of singing.</p>\n<p>Previous playback experiments by this research team have shown that a well-sung song, compared to a rusty one, is a bigger turn-on for females and more threatening to eavesdropping males, Peters says.</p>\n<p>If male swamp sparrows see improvements in their singing within hours, the researchers say, the next step is to find out if females take note. If so, then males that sing early and often may have an advantage in attracting a mate.</p>\n<p>The National Science Foundation funded the research.</p>\n<p>The research appears in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.06.018\"><em>Animal Behaviour</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://today.duke.edu/2020/08/songbirds-people-sing-better-after-warming\">Duke University</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org/birds-singing-practice-morning-2426512/\">Birds sing better with some early morning practice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org\">Futurity</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:20:06 +0000","feedId":1674,"bgimg":"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/birds-singing-morning-practice_1600-770x440.jpg","linkMd5":"43a89d0f1cf03e2ab759d561f9259109","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn98@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-35-21-899_87318a42947fab4b.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":95155,"destBytes":73570,"author":"Robin Smith-Duke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/birds-singing-morning-practice_1600-770x440.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn98@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-35-21-899_87318a42947fab4b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279656863},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","title":"Reversible ‘stitches’ give self-healing polymers new powers","link":"https://www.futurity.org/?p=2426642","description":"<img width=\"640\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/self-healing-synthetic-polymers_1600-770x440.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"A researcher wearing blue gloves twists a thin, yellow piece of the self-healing synthetic polymer\" style=\"padding:0 0 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/self-healing-synthetic-polymers_1600-770x440.jpg 770w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/self-healing-synthetic-polymers_1600-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/self-healing-synthetic-polymers_1600-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/self-healing-synthetic-polymers_1600-1536x878.jpg 1536w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/self-healing-synthetic-polymers_1600.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p>A new family of polymers can self-heal, can retain a shape, and are recyclable, researchers report.</p>\n<p>The new synthetic materials range in texture from ultra-soft to extremely rigid.</p>\n<p>The researchers say their materials are 3D printable, self-healing, recyclable, and naturally adhere to each other in air or underwater.</p>\n<p>Nature&#8217;s blueprint for the human limb is a carefully layered structure with stiff bone wrapped in layers of different soft tissue, like muscle and skin, all perfectly bound together. Achieving this kind of sophistication using synthetic materials to build biologically inspired robotic parts or multicomponent, complex machines has posed an engineering challenge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have made an exciting group of materials whose properties can be fine-tuned to get either the softness of rubber or the strength of load-bearing plastics,&#8221; says Svetlana Sukhishvili, professor in the materials science and engineering department at Texas A&#38;M University and a corresponding author of the study in <em><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202002374\">Advanced Functional Materials</a></em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Their other desirable characteristics, like 3D printability and the ability to <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/squid-teeth-polymer-water-994632/\">self-heal</a> within seconds, make them suited for not just more realistic prosthetics and soft robotics, but also ideal for broad military applications such as agile platforms for air vehicles and futuristic self-healing aircraft wings.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>&#8216;Reversible stitches&#8217; for recyclable polymers</h3>\n<p>Synthetic polymers are made up of long strings of repeating molecular motifs, like beads on a chain. In elastomeric polymers, or elastomers, these long chains are lightly crosslinked, giving the materials a rubbery quality. However, these crosslinks can also be used to make the elastomers more rigid by increasing the number of crosslinks.</p>\n<p>Although previous studies have manipulated the density of crosslinks to make <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/bottlebrush-polymers-coatings-2212702/\">elastomers</a> stiffer, the resulting change in mechanical strength was generally permanent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Crosslinks are like stitches in a piece of cloth, the more stitches you have, the stiffer the material gets and vice versa,&#8221; Sukhishvili says. &#8220;But instead of having these &#8216;stitches&#8217; be permanent, we wanted to achieve dynamic and reversible crosslinking so that we can create materials that are recyclable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The researchers focused their attention on the molecules involved in the crosslinking. First, they chose a parent polymer, called prepolymer, and then chemically studded these prepolymer chains with two types of small crosslinking molecules—furan and maleimide.</p>\n<p>When they increased the number of these molecules in the prepolymer, they found that they could create materials stiffer. In this way, the hardest material they created was 1,000 times stronger than the softest.</p>\n<p>However, the crosslinks are also reversible. Furan and maleimide participate in a type of reversible chemical bonding. Put simply, in this reaction, furan and maleimide pairs can &#8220;click&#8221; and &#8220;unclick&#8221; depending on temperature.</p>\n<p>When the temperature is high enough, the molecules come apart from the polymer chains and the materials soften. At room temperature, the materials harden since the molecules quickly click back together, once again forming crosslinks. If there is any tear in these materials at ambient temperatures, the researchers showed that furan and maleimide automatically re-click, healing the gap within a few seconds.</p>\n<h3>Stiff or soft self-healing material</h3>\n<p>The researchers note that the temperatures at which the crosslinkers dissociate or unclick from the prepolymer chains are relatively the same for different stiffness levels. This property is useful for 3D printing with these materials. Regardless of whether they are soft or hard, the materials can be melted at the same temperature and then used as printing ink.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By modifying the hardware and processing parameters in a standard 3D printer, we were able to use our materials to print <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/3d-printing-glass-2221012/\">complex 3D objects</a> layer by layer,&#8221; says corresponding author Frank Gardea, research engineer in the United States Army Research Laboratory. &#8220;The unique advantage of our materials is that the layers that make up the 3D part can be of vastly different stiffness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the 3D part cools to room temperature, he says, the different layers join seamlessly, precluding the need for curing or any other chemical processing. Consequently, the 3D-printed parts can easily be melted using high heat and then recycled as printing ink.</p>\n<p>The researchers also note that their materials are reprogrammable. In other words, after being set into one shape, they can be made to change into a different shape using just heat.</p>\n<p>In the future, the researchers plan to increase the functionality of their new materials by amplifying its multifaceted properties outlined in the current study.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now, we can easily achieve around 80% self-healing at room temperature, but we would like to reach 100%. Also, we want to make our materials responsive to other stimuli other than temperature, like light,&#8221; Gardea says. &#8220;Further down the road, we&#8217;d like to explore introducing some low-level intelligence so that these materials know to autonomously adapt without needing a user to initiate the process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The United States Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory funded the work.</p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://today.tamu.edu/2020/08/17/versatile-new-material-family-could-build-realistic-prosthetics-futuristic-army-platforms/\">Texas A&#38;M University</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org/3d-printed-self-healing-synthetic-polymers-prosthetics-2426642/\">Reversible &#8216;stitches&#8217; give self-healing polymers new powers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.futurity.org\">Futurity</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 17:13:12 +0000","feedId":1674,"bgimg":"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/self-healing-synthetic-polymers_1600-770x440.jpg","linkMd5":"1b76bc68163db8d0cd0233e0529ef525","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn1@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-35-22-994_c68e936a6737d919.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":62139,"destBytes":28744,"author":"Vandana Suresh-Texas A&#38;M","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/self-healing-synthetic-polymers_1600-770x440.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn1@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-35-22-994_c68e936a6737d919.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598279656863},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:34:16","title":"Childhood adversity ups risk of early death","link":"https://www.futurity.org/?p=2425842","description":"<img width=\"640\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/childhood-adversity-early-death-risk_1600-770x440.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"A young girl walks alone wearing a backpack and looking down at the road\" style=\"padding:0 0 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/childhood-adversity-early-death-risk_1600-770x440.jpg 770w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/childhood-adversity-early-death-risk_1600-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/childhood-adversity-early-death-risk_1600-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/childhood-adversity-early-death-risk_1600-1536x878.jpg 1536w, https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/childhood-adversity-early-death-risk_1600.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p>Social adversity in childhood increases the risk of premature death in early adulthood, according to a new study of one million Danish children.</p>\n<p>The study finds that children who have experienced repeated serious adversity such as losing a parent, mental illness in the family, poverty, or being placed in foster care have a 4.5 times higher risk of dying in early adulthood than children who have not experienced adversity during childhood.</p>\n<p>In many ways, our childhood lays the foundation of our health in adult life. It is central to our physical and cognitive development. Disturbing this development  may have long-term consequences for our physical and mental health later in life.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We divided the children into five groups depending on the degree of <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/adversity-child-development-cortisol-2083862-2/\">adversity</a> experienced in childhood. The more stressful experiences they have experienced during childhood, the higher the mortality rate in early adulthood. For the most vulnerable children, the mortality rate is surprisingly 4.5 times higher,&#8221; says Naja Hulvej Rod, professor in the public health department at the University of Copenhagen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Group 1:</strong> 54% of the children experienced no or only very few isolated incidents of adversity in childhood.</li>\n<li><strong>Groups 2-4:</strong> 43% of the children experienced isolated incidents of adversity in childhood, mainly related to poverty or illness in the family. Here the researchers found a mortality rate in early adulthood that is 1.3-1.8 times higher than in Group 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Group 5:</strong> 3% experienced great social and stressful adversity throughout childhood. In this group, the mortality rate is 4.5 times higher than in Group 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The higher mortality rate in early adults (16 to 36 years of age) mainly manifests itself in <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/thoughts-of-suicide-emotional-violence-2087722-2/\">suicide</a> and accidents, but the findings also show a higher risk of dying from cancer in this group.</p>\n<p>The findings highlight the critical importance of broad structural public-health initiatives to reduce stressful adversity in childhood, the researchers say. For example, preventing childhood poverty and other adversity in childhood may, in time, help reduce social inequality in health.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is striking to see such a strong connection between adversity in childhood and mortality in the Danish welfare state, which among other things aims to promote financial stability among families with young children and to minimize social adversity,&#8221; says Hulvej Rod. &#8220;From an international perspective, you may worry that these associations are even stronger in a less extensive welfare system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The size of the study made it possible for the researchers to study the associations between incidents of social and stressful adversity throughout childhood and how it affects mortality rates among young adults.</p>\n<p>The researchers defined social adversity as financial <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/poverty-psychosis-spectrum-disorder-2053022-2/\">poverty</a> or long-term unemployment in the family and stressful adversity as the death of a parent, divorce, or alcohol/drug abuse among the parents.</p>\n<p>The study appears in <em><a
