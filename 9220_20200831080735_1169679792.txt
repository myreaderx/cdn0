When we examined the code for this feature, we determined that the setting will only show up on devices that don&#8217;t support Digital Wellbeing&#8217;s &#8220;Flip to Shhh&#8221; feature. That means it can only show up on non-Pixel devices with the Google Phone app installed. Today, the setting started to show up for many users, but the feature doesn&#8217;t seem to actually work just yet.</p>\n<p>We were first tipped off by Twitter user @TheTweetofVidd about the &#8220;Flip to Silence&#8221; setting showing up. The user spotted the setting on their <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-5-pro\">Redmi Note 5 Pro</a> running the Pixel Experience custom ROM. On Twitter, users with the <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/essential-phone\">Essential Phone</a>, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, iQOO 3, Redmi Note 5A, ASUS ZenFone 6, and POCO F1 spotted the setting in the Google Phone app. I also noticed it on my own <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-review/\">OnePlus Nord review unit</a>, though sadly, the feature didn&#8217;t work when I actually tried it.</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/google-phone-flip-to-silence-setting-non-pixel-phones/google-phone-flip-to-silence-1/'><img width=\"512\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-1-512x1024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"Google Phone app Flip to Silence\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-1-512x1024.jpg 512w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-1-150x300.jpg 150w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-1.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/google-phone-flip-to-silence-setting-non-pixel-phones/google-phone-flip-to-silence-2/'><img width=\"512\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-2-512x1024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"Google Phone app Flip to Silence\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-2-512x1024.jpg 512w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-2-150x300.jpg 150w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-2.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The &#8220;Flip to Silence&#8221; setting can be found in the new Settings &#62; Advanced submenu.

Before then, it only came pre-installed on Pixel phones, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/android-one/\">Android One</a> phones, and certain devices like the OnePlus Nord. Once the new &#8220;Flip to Silence&#8221; feature actually starts working, users who don&#8217;t have Digital Wellbeing&#8217;s &#8220;Flip to Shhh&#8221; feature, which is only available on the <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2\">Pixel 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-pixel-3/\">Pixel 3</a>, Pixel 3a, Pixel 4, and Pixel 4a, can turn their phone over to silence incoming phone calls. Some OEMs have this feature baked into their custom Android skins, but it&#8217;s nice to see Google add it to their dialer app for anyone to enjoy.</p>\n<!-- WP-Appbox (Version: 4.2.1 // Store: googleplay // ID: com.google.android.dialer) --><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer\" title=\"Phone\">Phone (Free, Google Play) →</a></p><!-- /WP-Appbox -->\n<p class=\"clear:both;\">\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-phone-flip-to-silence-setting-non-pixel-phones/\">Google Phone app rolls out a new &#8220;Flip to Silence&#8221; setting for non-Pixel phones</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com\">xda-developers</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 21:03:56 +0000","feedId":9220,"bgimg":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-1-512x1024.jpg","linkMd5":"8803aab5412d7f7206b06bbcd59e9636","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/31/08-07-09-559_369ef8151594c021.webp","destWidth":512,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":26224,"destBytes":17692,"author":"Mishaal Rahman","enclosureUrl":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2018/11/google-phone-beep.png","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-1-512x1024.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/31/08-07-09-559_369ef8151594c021.webp","https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Google-Phone-Flip-to-Silence-2-512x1024.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/31/08-07-32-080_d3c518376307be18.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598861229361},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 16:07:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 16:07:09","title":"Tell Us what You Want to See at HDC 2020 and Win a Huawei P40 Pro (Open to All Countries)","link":"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=328325","description":"<p>The 2020 HUAWEI Developer Conference is going to be held on September 10-12.

TIPA WORLD AWARDS nominated the phone as the best smartphone for photos, thanks to the amazing camera technology featured on the device. The P40 Pro has a 50MP camera with a 1/1.28 inch ultra vision sensor. It can take in a great deal of light which means photos in low-light situations look amazing. Combine this with the real-time depth-sensing camera, and you can create professional-level bokeh effects in your photos.</p>\n<p>Use the 100x SuperZoom array to get detailed shots of objects far away. Choose between the 3x optical zoom, the 20x hybrid zoom, or the 100x max zoom, for the best zoom camera in any smartphone.</p>\n<p>The Huawei P40 Pro also comes with a 40MP ultra-wide cine camera. This camera features a 1/1.54 inch sensor, ultra low-light video, ultra slow-motion video, telephoto video and 4K timelapse. It’s a feature-packed cinematic video camera designed to give the user all the tools they need to get the perfect shot.</p>\n<h6><em>We thank HUAWEI for sponsoring this post.

The article as published on August 26, 2020, is preserved below.</p></div>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">At the IFA trade show in September last year, Sony <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-5-announced-ifa-2019/\">unveiled the Xperia 5</a> — a compact version of its <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-xperia-10-xperia-10-plus-specifications-features/\">flagship Xperia 1</a> with the Snapdragon 855 SoC, triple cameras, and a 21:9 display. Similarly, the company is expected to launch a compact version of this year&#8217;s flagship <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-xperia-10-ii-xperia-pro-announcement/\">Xperia 1 II</a> and the device will, most likely, be called the Sony Xperia 5 II (Sony Xperia 5 Mark 2). While Sony has yet to reveal any information about the device, noted leaker Evan Blass has now shared a render <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/sony-xperia-5-ii-40872187\">on his Patreon page</a>, showing off the Xperia 5 II with a familiar design.</p>\n<p>As you can see in the attached image, the upcoming Xperia 5 II will look almost identical to the Xperia 5 from last year, featuring a 21:9 tall display with bezels on the top and bottom. The device will feature a triple camera setup on the back with minimal design changes to the camera module, a side-mounted capacitive fingerprint scanner, and a dedicated camera shutter button on the right edge. Unlike the original Xperia 5, however, the Xperia 5 II&#8217;s fingerprint scanner doesn&#8217;t look to be recessed and this could possibly be Sony&#8217;s solution to the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/some-sony-xperia-1-5-users-using-tape-improve-fingerprint-scanner-recognition/\">fingerprint scanner issues</a> that plagued the Xperia 1 and <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-5-hands-on/\">Xperia 5</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-327767\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Sony-Xperia-5-II-660x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Sony Xperia 5 II leaked render\" width=\"660\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Sony-Xperia-5-II-660x1024.jpg 660w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Sony-Xperia-5-II-193x300.jpg 193w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Sony-Xperia-5-II-768x1192.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Sony-Xperia-5-II.jpg 773w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" /></p>\n<p>Although the render reveals no information about the Xperia 5 II&#8217;s hardware specifications, we believe that it will be a minor upgrade over its predecessor since the Xperia 1 II was also a minor upgrade over the original Xperia 1. We expect Sony to include Qualcomm&#8217;s flagship <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-865-processor-specifications-features/\">Snapdragon 865 SoC</a> on the Xperia 5 II, coupled with an FHD+ OLED display, up to 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.</p>\n<p>Due to the smaller form factor, the battery on the device will also be smaller than the one found on the Xperia 1 II and it should be between 3,200mAh and 3,600mAh. The device will, most likely, feature the same camera setup as the Xperia 1 II, with a 12MP f/1.7 primary camera, a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera, and a 12MP f/2.4 telephoto camera. Over on the front, the device is expected to feature a single 8MP selfie shooter. As mentioned earlier, Sony is yet to release any official information about the Xperia 5 II. We&#8217;ll update this post as and when the company releases any information about the device.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Update 1: More Renders, Specs, and Launch Date</h2>\n<p>Earlier today, Sony <a href=\"http://www.xperiablog.net/2020/08/27/sony-to-announce-xperia-5-ii-on-17-september-2020/\">sent out press invites</a> for a new Xperia product announcement on September 17th.

Source: <a href=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/Exclusive-Sony-Xperia-5-2-Android-Smartphone-Leak\">AndroidHeadlines</a></em></p>\n<p><em>AndroidHeadlines</em> also shared most of the key specifications for the device. The Xperia 5 II will have a 6.1-inch OLED panel at Full HD+ resolution, with the aspect ratio being Sony&#8217;s signature ultra-wide 21:9. The display will support HDR content and sports a 120Hz refresh rate with a 240Hz touch sampling rate. In contrast, the Xperia 1 II had a 4K display that ran at a 60Hz refresh rate but produced a &#8220;90Hz equivalent&#8221; refresh rate experience using Sony&#8217;s “Motion Blur Reduction” technology. The dimensions of the Xperia 5 II are supposedly 158 x 68 x 8mm, which makes the phone very similar in size to the Xperia 5.</p>\n<p>Under-the-hood, the Xperia 5 II is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage that&#8217;s expandable via a microSD card slot. With the Snapdragon 865 comes support for 5G connectivity via the Snapdragon X55 modem, though it remains to be seen if that will include mmWave 5G support. The phone will run off of a 4,000mAh capacity battery and features a USB Type-C port for USB PD charging.</p>\n<p>In terms of cameras, there are 3 to speak of: an ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto lens. <em>AndroidHeadlines</em> says the primary camera is a 12MP image sensor with a 24mm lens, f/1.7 aperture, and 82° FoV. The 3X zoom telephoto camera is also 12MP and has an aperture of f/2.4. The ultra wide-angle lens is <em>also</em> 12MP, sports an f/2.2 aperture, focal length of 16, and a very wide 124° FoV. Lastly, the Xperia 5 II can record in 4K HDR at up to 120fps and has Sony&#8217;s Optical SteadyShot (hybrid OIS and EIS stabilization) for video.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Update: New Xperia 5 II leaks reveal

globally","link":"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=328645","description":"<p class=\"dropcap\">With the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-announced-snapdragon-765g-90hz-display-quad-cameras/\">launch of the OnePlus Nord</a> late last month, OnePlus entered the affordable smartphone space once again. The device packed in a 6.44-inch FHD+ OLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate and Qualcomm&#8217;s mid-range Snapdragon 765G chip for a starting price of ₹27,999 or €399 in India and Europe, respectively. However, the OnePlus Nord isn&#8217;t the only <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-confirms-making-affordable-smartphones-again/\">affordable smartphone</a> that the company plans to launch this year. Shortly after the launch of the OnePlus Nord, the company confirmed that it would be launching <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-coming-to-the-us/\">another Nord-branded device in the U.S.</a> later this year. Now, a recent report from <em>Android Central</em> reveals that OnePlus is working on a budget-friendly device codenamed &#8220;Clover,&#8221; which will be launched globally.</p>\n<p>The report cites an insider source who has confirmed that OnePlus is working on an entry-level smartphone powered by Qualcomm&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/qualcomm-snapdragon-460/\">Snapdragon 460</a> chipset. The device, codenamed Clover, is rumored to feature a 6.52-inch 720p IPS LCD panel, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage with a microSD card slot for expansion. The device will feature a capacitive fingerprint scanner on the back, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Wi-Fi ac connectivity.</p>\n<p>The source further reveals that the OnePlus Clover will feature a triple camera setup on the back, with a 13MP primary sensor and two 2MP sensors. The device will pack in a massive 6,000mAh battery with support for 18W fast charging. Interestingly, OnePlus&#8217; sister company OPPO just launched a device with similar specifications in the Indian market.</p>\n<p>The recently launched <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/oppo-a53-qualcomm-snapdragon-460-5000mah-battery-launched-india/\">OPPO A53</a> also packs in Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon 460 SoC, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a microSD card expansion slot, a 6.5-inch HD+ LCD, and a triple camera setup with a 13MP primary camera and two 2MP sensors. The only difference between the two devices is that the OPPO A53 packs in a smaller 5,000mAh battery. Since OnePlus has a track record of taking inspiration from existing OPPO devices, there&#8217;s a chance that the upcoming OnePlus Clover will be based on the OPPO A53.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">OnePlus is a Billie fan.

People started modding Linux-powered wireless routers and access points long before the rise of Android smartphones in order to enable functionalities such as packet filtering, firewalls, or adblocking that aren&#8217;t otherwise present in the stock firmware. Unsurprisingly, such features are much requested in the world of Android as well. While it is possible to configure Private DNS (or DNS-over-HTTPS) and subsequently block ads on an Android device since <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/androidpie/\">Android Pie</a>, end-users still need to rely on third-party apps to set up a proper firewall. If you are looking for an all-in-one app that can act as a firewall, adblocker, and even a DNS-over-HTTPS client, BraveDNS might interest you.</p>\n<p>The name &#8220;BraveDNS&#8221; might sound like yet another DNS resolver service, but it is certainly more than that. This free and open-source app describes itself as &#8220;an <a href=\"https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch\">OpenSnitch</a>-inspired firewall and network monitor + a <a href=\"https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole\">pi-hole</a>-inspired DNS over HTTPS client with blocklists&#8221;. The DoH client module, which is mostly based on another popular open-source project named <a href=\"https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/intra\">Intra</a>, uses its own ads, trackers, and spyware-blocking DNS endpoint. The developer team also offers their own DNS resolver service as a paid option for those who need features like custom blocklists, allowlists, the ability to store DNS logs for later analysis, etc.</p>\n<p>Below you can find a list of features that are currently offered by the app:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DNS over HTTPS (circumvent censorship and prevent surveillance of DNS logs by ISPs and everyone else).</li>\n<li>View DNS logs.</li>\n<li>BraveDNS ads, trackers, and spyware-blocking DNS endpoint powered by <a href=\"https://dbl.oisd.nl/\">oisd_dbl</a> and <a href=\"https://energized.pro/\">Energized Protection</a></li>\n<li>Firewall by app categories.</li>\n<li>Firewall individual apps.</li>\n<li>Firewall when apps are in the background (not-in-active-use).</li>\n<li>Firewall when device is locked.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<img width=\"346\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"bravedns_1\" columns=\"4\" link=\"none\" size=\"full\" ids=\"328337,328339,328341,328343\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"328337,328339,328341,328343\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_1.jpg 346w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_1-150x300.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" />\n<img width=\"346\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_2.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"bravedns_2\" columns=\"4\" link=\"none\" size=\"full\" ids=\"328337,328339,328341,328343\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"328337,328339,328341,328343\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_2.jpg 346w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_2-150x300.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" />\n<img width=\"346\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_3.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"bravedns_3\" columns=\"4\" link=\"none\" size=\"full\" ids=\"328337,328339,328341,328343\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"328337,328339,328341,328343\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_3.jpg 346w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_3-150x300.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" />\n<img width=\"346\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_4.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"bravedns_4\" columns=\"4\" link=\"none\" size=\"full\" ids=\"328337,328339,328341,328343\" orderby=\"post__in\" include=\"328337,328339,328341,328343\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_4.jpg 346w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/bravedns_4-150x300.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" />\n\n<p>The latest version of BraveDNS on Google Play and on the website requires at least Android 8 Oreo, but the developers have plans to make it compatible all the way down to Android Marshmallow in the near future.

The company had announced the development of <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-first-8gb-lpddr5-dram-chip-mobile-devices/\">8Gb (gigabit) LPDDR5 RAM</a> in back in July 2018, following up with mass production of <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-mass-production-12gb-lpddr5-dram-galaxy-note/\"> 12GB LPDDR5 mobile DRAM</a> package in July 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-begins-mass-production-16gb-lpddr5-dram-smartphones/\">16GB LPDDR5 mobile DRAM package in February 2020</a>. This new announcement is for the second production line in Pyeongtaek, Korea, which has now commenced mass production of the industry&#8217;s first 16-gigabit (Gb) LPDDR5 DRAM using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology and built on Samsung&#8217;s third-generation 10nm-class (1z) process.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span>&#8220;</span>The 1z-based 16Gb LPDDR5 elevates the industry to a new threshold, overcoming a major developmental hurdle in DRAM scaling at advanced nodes. We will continue to expand our premium DRAM lineup and exceed customer demands, as we lead in growing the overall memory market.<span>&#8221;</span></p><footer>Jung-bae Lee, Executive Vice President of DRAM Product &#38; Technology, Samsung Electronics</footer></blockquote>\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s Pyeongtaek Line 2 is the largest-scale semiconductor production line to date, spanning more than 128,900 square meters/1.3 million square feet, which is the equivalent of about 16 soccer fields. Samsung says that the new Pyeongtaek line will &#8220;<em>serve as the key manufacturing hub for the industry’s most advanced semiconductor technologies, delivering cutting-edge DRAM followed by next-generation V-NAND and foundry solutions, while reinforcing the company’s leadership in the Industry 4.0 era</em>&#8220;.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-329275\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/PT2Line_16GBLPDDR5_dl3-1024x724.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"636\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/PT2Line_16GBLPDDR5_dl3-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/PT2Line_16GBLPDDR5_dl3-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/PT2Line_16GBLPDDR5_dl3-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/PT2Line_16GBLPDDR5_dl3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>The new 16Gb LPDDR5 is the first memory based on currently most advanced 1z process node and which is being mass-produced using EUV tech, making it the highest speed and largest capacity available in mobile DRAM. The 1z process also makes this LPDDR5 package about 30% thinner than its predecessor (referring to the 12Gb LPDDR5 package), and about 16% faster. The 16Gb LPDDR5 can build a 16GB package with only eight chips, whereas the 1y-based 16GB LPDDR5 package required 12 chips (eight 12Gb chips and four 8Gb chips) to provide the same capacity.</p>\n<p>Samsung is also planning to expand the use of its LPDDR5 offerings into automotive applications, offering an extended temperature range to meet strict safety and reliability standards in extreme environments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-begins-mass-production-of-16gb-lpddr5-dram-at-worlds-largest-semiconductor-line\">Samsung Newsroom</a></strong></p>\n<p class=\"clear:both;\">\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-starts-mass-producing-third-gen-16gb-lpddr5-ram-modules/\">Samsung starts mass producing its third-gen 16Gb LPDDR5 RAM modules</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com\">xda-developers</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:09:13 +0000","feedId":9220,"bgimg":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/PT2Line_16GBLPDDR5_dl3-1024x724.jpg","linkMd5":"1bb60094b4f92556d94bef2ff71d0403","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn59@2020_2/2020/08/31/08-07-09-619_ed2b97a33e62f383.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":724,"sourceBytes":52819,"destBytes":35010,"author":"Aamir Siddiqui","enclosureUrl":"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/02/Galaxy-S20-Ultra-16GB-RAM.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/PT2Line_16GBLPDDR5_dl3-1024x724.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn59@2020_2/2020/08/31/08-07-09-619_ed2b97a33e62f383.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598861229357},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 16:07:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 16:07:09","title":"Google deprecates its App Preview Messaging feature occasionally used by Photos and Duo","link":"https://www.xda-developers.com/?p=328895","description":"<p class=\"dropcap\">When Google introduced Allo in 2016, the company also detailed a feature for developers of messaging apps known as App Preview Messaging. This feature was aimed at allowing users to send a message from their favorite messaging app to any contact in their phonebook (provided both the sender and the recipient are using an Android device), even if the recipient of the message doesn&#8217;t have the app installed. So, say you try starting a Duo video chat with a friend. If your friend doesn&#8217;t have Duo installed on their Android phone, they’d get a notification prompting them to download it thanks to App Preview Messaging. The feature is even set up to give users the ability to reply to the message without installing the app! Google employed this feature in Allo (<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-allo-shutting-down/\">which no longer exists</a>), Duo, and Photos to get people to sign up for these services.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-328899 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/nexus2cee_Screenshot_20180111-152951-668x1336-1-512x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/nexus2cee_Screenshot_20180111-152951-668x1336-1-512x1024.jpg 512w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/nexus2cee_Screenshot_20180111-152951-668x1336-1-150x300.jpg 150w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/nexus2cee_Screenshot_20180111-152951-668x1336-1.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the feature seems to have fallen by the wayside, never graduating from early access despite <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190706034154/https://developers.google.com/android/guides/app-preview-messaging\">Google&#8217;s promises to open it up</a>.

It packs in a bunch of additional features that aren&#8217;t available on <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-chrome/\">Google Chrome</a>, and Samsung <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-internet-12-beta-adds-support-multiple-password-autofill-apps/\">keeps adding new features</a> to the browser ever so often. Early last month, the browser received a major update on the beta channel, which introduced a <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-internet-beta-tab-grid/\">Chrome-like tab grid layout</a> to the browser. Now, version 12.1.2.5 of the browser has started rolling out on the stable channel, and it brings a ton of improvements.</p>\n<p>According to a recent report from <em>Sammobile</em>, Samsung Internet v12.1.2.5 is rolling out to users via the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-play-store/\">Google Play Store</a> and Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Store. It includes optimizations for dark mode UI elements to improve visibility and enhancements for the browser&#8217;s ability to display and navigate desktop pages. The update addresses a pop-up zoom error that prevented seamless zooming on desktop pages in previous versions, which will allow users to zoom on the desktop versions of websites without any issues.</p>\n<p>The latest update for Samsung Internet also brings improvements for the browser&#8217;s pinch-to-zoom functionality and a few video assistant-specific enhancements. With the update, Samsung has also addressed a bug that produced generic errors and app crashes when switching from picture-in-picture video playback to a full-screen player. Geolocation accuracy on the browser has also received improvements in the update. Along with all these improvements, version 12.1.2.5 of the browser includes a range of smaller bug fixes and performance optimizations.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, Samsung Internet v12.1.2.5 has already started rolling out to users via the Google Play Store and the Samsung <a href=\"https://sammobile.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgalaxystore.samsung.com%2Fprepost%2F000004555258%3FappId%3Dcom.sec.android.app.sbrowser&#38;ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.asana.com%2F0%2F1179573953519059%2F1191176069207875&#38;currurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sammobile.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-internet-dark-mode-visibility-improvements-dex-update\">Galaxy Store</a>.

Martin is remembered not only as a truly talented developer and maintainer but also as a kind and down-to-earth person who never hesitated to take the time to help others.</p>\n<p>His introduction to Ground Zero ROMs came in 2013 when he helped XDA Recognized Contributor <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5213564\">Char_G</a> (currently the publicist for GZR) test a build of GZR&#8217;s Validus ROM for the first-generation Moto G (Falcon). From there he caught the attention of XDA Senior Member and founder of Ground Zero ROMs John Brewer (<a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5283048\">TheRingMaster_GzR</a>), who brought him aboard the team as a maintainer but quickly recognized his talent and promoted him to a lead developer. It was John&#8217;s Validus build that Martin had helped Char with testing. He was a strong advocate for keeping code neat and clean, observing proper formatting and spacing, which is extremely important especially for team projects like most custom ROMs. He also insisted on a clean commit history and maintaining proper authorship. In the years following, he became instrumental in bringing GZR&#8217;s popular custom ROMs to OnePlus and OPPO devices and became a mentor to many other developers on the GZR team. In John&#8217;s words,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>&#8220;The man made OPPO dev[elopment] what it is. They sent him devices because he knew what to do. Plus he made CAF devices possible on an AOSP system without a separate CAF manifest.&#8221;</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Despite his ties to OPPO and OnePlus, he remained humble, never bragging about the devices he was sent but rather patiently lending a helping hand to anyone who asked. I can personally say that his help wasn&#8217;t limited to other developers. When I was having some problems getting &#8220;OK Google&#8221; to work on my <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5t\">OnePlus 5T</a> back in late 2017, he took the time to help me through it, and he again helped me track down why the Amazon Appstore kept crashing (I was running Validus at the time).</p>\n<p>Martin&#8217;s mentoring chops weren&#8217;t limited to coding, maintaining, or troubleshooting. Another member of the team known in <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/announcing-the-official-xda-developers-telegram-group/\">Telegram</a> as &#8220;Scoobyjenkins&#8221; mentioned that Martin had encouraged him to grow in graphic design skills, including making icons, wallpapers, and boot animations for the various ROMs developed by the team.</p>\n<p>Martin was the one who started the popular GZR ROM Tipsy, naming each version after a popular Belgian beer in alphabetical order. Additionally, he helped John start GZOSP, which was envisioned as an alternative codebase to <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/lineageos/\">LineageOS</a> for building custom ROMs. Incidentally, GZOSP was the subject of my <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/ground-zero-open-source-project-gzosp-android-oreo/\">very first article</a> here, so Martin&#8217;s work was instrumental even to my own contributions to XDA.</p>\n<p>Even in his later years, as he valiantly fought against the progression of his cancer, he refused to bend or break. He once told his GZR family the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m like Churchill, never surrender.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While he was a valued member of the Ground Zero ROMs family, he was also widely known in the larger Android development community and was highly respected by developers, as demonstrated by a touching tweet from the Dirty Unicorns team that was retweeted by the AquariOS and CarbonROM teams:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today we lost a pillar of our community!</p>\n<p>A man who was always willing to help and teach others.

Even though we met through the Android community, you allowed so many people into your personal life, that it would be an injustice to think of you in any other fashion than family. The immense amount of knowledge that you held, balanced by your incredible humility, makes you a true one of a kind person and one that this world will never see the likes of again. It was a true honor to be your tester for so many years, along with your friend. You fought this disease head on, on your terms, and without fear, never once asking for anyone&#8217;s sympathy. You stayed strong, with your head held high, right to the end. I can only hope to emulate a fraction of the courage that you have displayed these past couple years, in any facet of my life. Sadly, I fear this is where many of us will falter and just one more example of one of the many qualities of your life that drew so many into orbit around you. Thank you for everything that you have taught me over the years, from an Android standpoint, but also from a life&#8217;s experiences viewpoint as well. I love you, brother.

Huawei did not have any input into the content of this review.</em></p>\n<h2>Huawei Watch GT 2e Design</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-326911 size-large\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/IMG_20200624_134325-1024x769.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Watch GT 2e lava red strap\" width=\"900\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/IMG_20200624_134325-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/IMG_20200624_134325-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/IMG_20200624_134325-768x577.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/IMG_20200624_134325.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>The Huawei Watch GT 2e that we received is the Lava Red variant. The straps are bright red and might actually induce trypophobia as a few people I showed it to disliked the strap design. Thankfully, I had the Honor Magic Watch 2 for review last year, and the genuine leather straps from that device fit in the Huawei Watch GT 2e. I&#8217;ve been rocking these genuine leather straps for a couple of weeks after getting the device. The red straps are certainly comfortable, but I really didn&#8217;t like how they looked.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, the Huawei Watch GT 2e features a pretty basic design that from a distance looks exactly like a normal watch. On the right side of the device are two buttons—the top one accesses the app list while the bottom one can be configured as a shortcut for any of these apps. There&#8217;s nothing really special or unique about the Huawei Watch GT 2e, but that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-326511 size-large\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000465-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Watch GT 2e buttons\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000465-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000465-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000465-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000465.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>On the underside of the watch are the heart rate and SpO2 sensors, alongside the charging pins. The Huawei Watch GT 2e sits in a basic magnetic charging cradle. Overall, it&#8217;s not the most original design, but watch designs are inherently subjective and personal. I don&#8217;t like the Lava Red straps, but you might.</p>\n<h2>Charging and battery life</h2>\n<p>The Huawei Watch GT 2e has a rather generous 2-week battery life, which makes it convenient to use constantly. If you turn on the always-on display (like I have here) that&#8217;ll be cut down to about 7 days of battery life, which is still very good. Huawei put a huge focus on battery life, and the Watch GT 2e charges rather quickly in the included magnetic charging cradle. The charging cradle is powered via USB-C, and the watch simply snaps into it when you hold it close. It can be a little bit finicky to get right at times, but for the most part, it works fine and will start charging instantly. Overall I have no complaints about the battery life, and even when GPS tracking is on, it doesn&#8217;t drain too much.</p>\n<h2>LiteOS</h2>\n\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-watch-gt-2e-review/attachment/01000486/'><img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000486-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000486-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000486-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000486-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000486.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-watch-gt-2e-review/attachment/01000487/'><img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000487-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000487-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000487-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000487-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000487.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-watch-gt-2e-review/attachment/01000488/'><img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000488-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000488-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000488-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000488-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000488.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-watch-gt-2e-review/attachment/01000489/'><img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000489-1024x768.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000489-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000489-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000489-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/01000489.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a>\n\n<p>Sadly, though, LiteOS is still <em>Lite</em>OS. You don&#8217;t get a whole lot of apps to choose from, and you&#8217;re restricted to the Huawei-made watch faces that get added over time to the Huawei Health app. I don&#8217;t really like a lot of them, though I&#8217;ve managed to settle on one. To be honest, if I could use the always-on display one all of the time, I&#8217;d be happy. <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-watch-gt-custom-watch-faces/\">In China</a>, it&#8217;s possible to add custom watch faces to your device, though I wasn&#8217;t able to find a way to do this on international variants without a Chinese Huawei Health ID.</p>\n<p>LiteOS is Huawei and Honor&#8217;s alternative to Wear OS, which is <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-announces-wear-os-based-on-android-11-new-version-snapdragon-wear-4100-support/\">still alive even today</a> despite all its faults. LiteOS is even more locked down than Wear OS as you&#8217;re limited to what comes pre-installed on the smartwatch. My issues with LiteOS are the same ones I had with the Honor Magic Watch 2. For example, why is the always-on watch face different from the one that I select and set for day-to-day usage? Why don&#8217;t the watch faces have a built-in AMOLED mode specific to that watch face? Just like on the Honor Magic Watch 2, the transition between the two looks somewhat clunky.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-326913 size-large\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000459-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Watch GT 2e watch face\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000459-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000459-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000459-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/P1000459.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s without getting into the lack of apps, which I sorely miss from Wear OS. I can&#8217;t <strong>really</strong> control my music playback, nor can I even <em>respond</em> to messages (even with pre-defined responses). On Wear OS, you can control Spotify even down to choosing playlists, and typing on the original Huawei Watch was surprisingly viable in a pinch, which I made use of it quite a lot. Even my smartphone&#8217;s train tracking app has a companion Wear OS app that I can use to plug in my local station to see the times of the next arriving and departing trains. Shazam also has a Wear OS app! There&#8217;s so much that I miss when using LiteOS, and it feels like its potential is extremely limited as a result.</p>\n<p>However, LiteOS has a number of useful and cool features, even if a lot of them I don&#8217;t end up getting to use. You can raise to wake the smartwatch to view a notification, for example. These notifications can also be configured on a per-app basis, and raising your wrist will show you the most recent notification. The one major improvement I&#8217;ve noticed since the last time I&#8217;ve used LiteOS, though, is how much smoother it feels on the Huawei Watch GT 2e. There are no real slowdowns, apps launch quickly, and there&#8217;s no noticeable lag. Overall, for what it is, LiteOS is no longer frustrating to use and navigate. Big improvement in that department!</p>\n<!-- WP-Appbox (Version: 4.2.1 // Store: googleplay // ID: com.huawei.bone) --><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huawei.bone\" title=\"Huawei Wear\">Huawei Wear (Free, Google Play) →</a></p><!-- /WP-Appbox -->\n<h3>Workout mode</h3>\n<p>The Huawei Watch GT 2e is primarily aimed at those looking for a fitness tracking smartwatch. It&#8217;s filled with various workout features and packs a GPS tracker for outdoor usage. One aspect that I quite liked is that the watch can automatically detect certain workouts. When walking outside, I&#8217;ve had it pop-up and ask if I&#8217;m walking indoors or outdoors. If I select outdoors, it will then start tracking my location.

GPS tracking seems really accurate on the watch, which I compared against my phone. You can also copy music to your watch in MP3 format, connect a pair of earphones to it, and then listen to your music while you workout. While I can understand the appeal for truly offline and remote use, I think adding support for popular music streaming apps would make more sense. I&#8217;d rather save and/or control my music from Spotify as I don&#8217;t listen to music from MP3 files anymore, and I haven&#8217;t in years. There are loads of other workouts supported by the Huawei Watch GT 2e—far too many to list. From running to triathlons to belly dancing to Taekwondo&#8230; it really does seem to have everything. It&#8217;ll cover basically anything you can think of when it comes to workouts, so I wouldn&#8217;t worry about your sport of choice not being trackable on the Watch GT 2e.</p>\n<!-- WP-Appbox (Version: 4.2.1 // Store: googleplay // ID: com.huawei.health) --><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huawei.health\" title=\"Huawei Health\">Huawei Health (Free, Google Play) →</a></p><!-- /WP-Appbox -->\n<h3>Heart rate monitoring</h3>\n<p>Health tracking is the main focus of the Huawei Watch GT 2e, so I&#8217;d hope that the heart-rate monitoring is active.

The results were corroborated by my Honor Band 5, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-band-5-vs-mi-band-4-vs-fitbit-inspire-hr/\">which also matched the results from my Fitbit Inspire HR and Xiaomi Mi Band 4</a>.

I have been quite stressed out recently, yet the watch measures generally within the region of &#8220;10-20&#8221; consistently. Anything below 29 is considered “relaxed” while a high of 54 is comfortably in the “normal” stage. When writing the Honor Magic Watch 2 review, it said that my stress level had spiked to 57, well within the normal range. Right before an exam that I had that morning, I was sitting at a consistent stress level of 15 for several hours. The stress monitor doesn&#8217;t seem to actually match how I perceive my own level of stress.</p>\n<h3>Sleep tracking</h3>\n<p>However, the sleep tracker certainly does work. In fact, it works extremely well and picks up on the odd nap or two that I&#8217;ve needed in the past couple of months that I&#8217;ve used the watch. I only have one minor criticism of it, though, and it actually relates to taking naps. If you wake up in the morning and then go back to sleep, it identifies any subsequent sleep as naps and thus doesn&#8217;t analyze any in-depth data. Furthermore, the watch nags at you in the sleep summary and may tell you that you napped for too long. I don&#8217;t understand why, if I&#8217;ve woken up from sleep and then fallen back asleep within 5 minutes, it doesn&#8217;t just continue counting it as the same cycle. It doesn&#8217;t seem to do this in the middle of the night, though, as I&#8217;ve only had this happen after 8 am.</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-watch-gt-2e-review/screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-07-03_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4/'><img width=\"465\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-07-03_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4-465x1024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-07-03_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4-465x1024.jpg 465w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-07-03_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4-136x300.jpg 136w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-07-03_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4.jpg 545w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-watch-gt-2e-review/screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-10-41_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4/'><img width=\"465\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-10-41_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4-465x1024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-10-41_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4-465x1024.jpg 465w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-10-41_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4-136x300.jpg 136w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_2020-08-24-01-01-10-41_efaee9233a816a5de5fd5a4cb49356f4.jpg 545w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" /></a>\n\n<p>Overall, though, it seems to have an incredibly accurate sleep tracker, and it&#8217;s really easy to digest the data that it records.</p>\n<h3>Other features</h3>\n<p>The Huawei Watch GT 2e has other features too, including breathing exercises, a compass, and a weather app. The weather app pulls in information based on your current location, while the compass requires calibrating it first. I didn’t have an actual compass on me to compare the output, but it did reasonably match what my phone showed. The breathing exercises are exactly as they sound, and can be used to help with anxiety with a small animation that shows on the display that you can focus on. Finally, there’s also a “Find my phone” feature, which does exactly what it says. Selecting it will make your phone begin to shout loudly <em>“I’m heeeere”</em> and ring until you pick it up or cancel it from your watch.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Huawei Watch GT 2e is a pretty great smartwatch, and I enjoyed using it. Sadly, I feel that LiteOS is still too limiting. If fitness and health are your prerogatives, then the Huawei Watch GT 2e is definitely worth taking a look at. It&#8217;s packed to the brim with health-related features, and the sleep tracking is very accurate as well. There are so many fitness tracking modes, too, that I imagine it&#8217;s hard to find a competitor actually capable of so much. I just really wish that I could choose more watch faces and have access to more apps on it. It doesn&#8217;t even have NFC on the global model, so you can&#8217;t use it for contactless payments.</p>\n<p>Huawei&#8217;s Watch GT 2e feels like it&#8217;s trying to be both a smartwatch <strong>and</strong> a fitness tracker, despite lacking somewhat in the former. It excels when it comes to fitness, and it definitely smokes the likes of Fitbit in terms of value for money. It&#8217;s not the cheapest <em>fitness tracker</em> out there, but it&#8217;s also not the most expensive <em>smartwatch</em>. If the Watch GT 2e&#8217;s sports and health features appeal to you and you&#8217;re interested in picking one up, you can find one for between €120-€200 depending on the retailer, so it&#8217;s definitely not the most expensive smartwatch out there.</p>\n<div class=\"productboxprosconstopofpage\">\n<div class=\"xda_productboxproscons\">\n<ul class=\"product-title\">\n  <a href=\"http://xda.tv/HuaweiWatchGT2e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><h4 class=\"reco-product-title\">Huawei Watch GT2e</h4></a>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"col-md-4 col-sm-6\">\n  <ul class=\"reco-features-image\">\n<a href=\"http://xda.tv/HuaweiWatchGT2e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-10741 prosconsboximgleft\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/huawei-watch-gt2e-product-shot.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Watch GT2e\" width=\"213\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\"/></a>\n  </ul>\n     </div>\n<div class=\"col-md-8 col-sm-6\">\n   <script>if (\"\".length > 0) { document.write(' <ul class=\"rating\"> \\\n    <h4 class=\"rating-title\">Our Score:     <div class=\"reviewstars\" style=\"--rating:\t\\ ;\" aria-label=\"Rating of this product is  out of 5.\"></div></h4></ul> '); }</script> \n<ul class=\"recodesc\">\nThe Huawei Watch GT2e is a pretty great smartwatch, and despite some limitations to the smartwatch functionality in LiteOS, it remains one of the best fitness trackers you can buy.

But there are concerns about how often the REVVL 5G will be updated. How quickly will it get Android 11 when the software is released this fall? How often will it get security updates?</p>\n<p>Either way, T-Mobile claims it offers the most coverage of 5G — more than AT&#38;T and Verizon combined — making the REVVL 5G a great prospect for those curious about what 5G is all about. With a 4,500mAh battery, 6.53-inch FHD+ display, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 processor, the REVVL 5G should be more than capable of handling everyday tasks.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_328739\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-328739\" class=\"size-full wp-image-328739\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/T-Mobile-REVVL-5G.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/T-Mobile-REVVL-5G.png 750w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/T-Mobile-REVVL-5G-300x300.png 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/T-Mobile-REVVL-5G-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-328739\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">T-Mobile REVVL 5G</p></div>\n<p>In addition to the REVVL 5G, T-Mobile also unveiled the REVVL 4 ($120) and REVVL 4+ ($192), a pair of affordable handsets without 5G support.

The industry seems to be trending toward smartphones with either under-display camera or foldable display tech, but Korean tech giant LG is experimenting with its own unique smartphone design. The company is rumored to be working on a smartphone called the &#8220;LG Wing,&#8221; an aptly named dual display smartphone with a secondary display that swivels horizontally behind the main display. Many in the media assumed that such an experimental smartphone will only launch in LG&#8217;s home market of South Korea, but we have now learned that LG plans to launch the Wing in the United States.</p>\n<p>A source close to LG tells me that the LG Wing will launch in the U.S. this fall for around $1,000. That&#8217;s significantly cheaper than suggested by a recent report making the rounds from South Korean publication <a href=\"http://news.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20200826000843\"><em>Herald Corp</em></a>, which pegged the LG Wing at a price as high as ₩1,900,000, or ~$1,607 when converted to USD. Keep in mind that smartphone prices can&#8217;t be cleanly converted between markets because of differences in taxes, distribution, local market needs, carrier deals, etc. For example, here is a table comparing the starting prices of the <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-velvet\">LG Velvet</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g8\">LG G8 ThinQ</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/v50-thinq\">LG V50 ThinQ</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-20-ultra\">Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</a> in Korea versus the starting prices of these same phones in the United States.</p>\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"table_orange\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Smartphone</th>\n<th>Starting Price in Korea/Converted to USD</th>\n<th>Starting Price (Actual) in USA</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>LG Velvet</td>\n<td>₩899,800 / ~$761</td>\n<td>$599</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LG G8 ThinQ</td>\n<td>₩897,600 / ~ $759</td>\n<td>$849</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LG V50 ThinQ</td>\n<td>₩1,199,000 / ~ $1,015</td>\n<td>$999</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</td>\n<td>₩1,450,000 / ~ $1,227</td>\n<td>$1,299</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>As you can see, some of the U.S. models ended up being cheaper than their South Korean counterparts, but the opposite has also been true in some cases. The prices in South Korea include the VAT rate of 10%, and I&#8217;m told by some South Koreans that people in the country typically buy phones from carriers on contracts rather than buying them outright, much like in the United States. That&#8217;s why I recommend against converting South Korean launch pricing to U.S. launch pricing since the converted prices won&#8217;t always end up being accurate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-wing\">LG Wing Forums</a></strong></p>\n<h2>LG Wing &#8211; Design, Specifications, Features</h2>\n<p>Our source can also confirm that the device that&#8217;s shown in videos published by <em>AndroidAuthority</em> is <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/first-look-lg-crazy-dual-display-wing-smartphone/\">indeed the LG Wing</a>. The publication earlier this week shared two videos recorded in a moving vehicle. The <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-wing-features-1150327/\">first video</a> shared by <em>AndroidAuthority</em> shows the LG Wing&#8217;s two displays being used for navigation and controlling music playback; in that video, the primary display is shown in portrait orientation while the secondary display is in landscape orientation behind the primary one. The <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-wing-gaming-1152135/\">second video</a> <i>AndroidAuthority </i>shared earlier today shows a passenger playing a game on the main display while the secondary display shows what appears to be an in-game map; in that video, the passenger is holding the LG Wing with the secondary display on top.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIq2H3KkxQk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KrIqwgYRiw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>These videos give us brief glimpses at the potential utility of the LG Wing&#8217;s dual screen design, though they, unfortunately, don&#8217;t show the actual swiveling mechanism in action. Regardless, we can piece together an understanding of what LG is trying to achieve with the Wing. The company is no stranger to dual screen phones—they offer a Dual Screen attachment for the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-v50-dual-screen-review/\">V50</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-g8x-with-dual-screen-first-impressions-a-fun-gimmick/\">G8X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-v60-thinq-dual-screen-review/\">V60</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/lgvelvet/\">Velvet</a> that receives input via <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-dual-screen-wireless-technology-revealed-mmwave/\">signals sent over what&#8217;s essentially mmWave</a>. LG&#8217;s Dual Screen attachment is a great way to expand the viewing area, and hence, the multitasking capability. However, because it&#8217;s an <em>attachment</em>, it becomes <em>yet another thing</em> that you have to carry around in your pocket or bag. Having a secondary display that&#8217;s always there when you need it would be much more convenient, though we&#8217;ll have to wait and see how LG engineered the Wing to determine how practical it actually is. How does the secondary display get stowed away, if at all? How thick is the phone with this display behind it? How does Android treat this display, and what, if anything, do app developers need to do to support it? These are all questions that can only be answered once we see more of the LG Wing, either from official sources or from leaks.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we won&#8217;t have to wait long to find out. Our source told us that the LG Wing is launching in the U.S. this fall, so we&#8217;ll only have to wait for up to 3 months before we see an announcement. When it lands in the U.S., it&#8217;ll cost around $1,000. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1298388924222648326\">We&#8217;ve seen evidence</a> it&#8217;ll be supported by Verizon, but our source could not confirm this.</p>\n<p>Our source also could not confirm any specifications, but earlier rumors suggest the LG Wing will fall in line with LG&#8217;s new &#8220;mass premium&#8221; market strategy. <a href=\"https://www.etnews.com/20200511000263?mc=em_008_0001\"><em>ETNews</em></a> reports that the device will feature a 6.8-inch main display, a 4-inch secondary display, a triple camera setup comprised of a 64MP primary image sensor, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 700 series processor with 5G capability, which means we can expect the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-processor-specifications-features/\">Snapdragon 765</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-processor-specifications-features/\">Snapdragon 765G</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-768g-mobile-platform/\">Snapdragon 768G</a>. <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/search?q=LGE+LM-F100N\">Multiple Geekbench listings</a> for a device with model name &#8220;LGE LM-F100N&#8221; and code-name &#8220;winglm&#8221; suggest the device will feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G in particular as the GPU is listed as the Adreno 620.

UDP is capable of automatically creating builds with all required SDKs in the background for each alternative app store, which can help you save a substantial amount of time while publishing to multiple app stores. The portal is designed in a way that <a href=\"https://unity.com/case-study/galactic-slice\">even a solo developer can use it</a> to share their game on several app distribution platforms.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-328613\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Unity-Distribution-Portal-how-to.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Unity-Distribution-Portal-how-to.jpg 768w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Unity-Distribution-Portal-how-to-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>To get started, all you need to do is create a developer&#8217;s account on each target app store where you want to publish your game. Then you can create a listing for your game, add the screenshots/description, and add your game binary. UDP will then create store-specific builds for your game and help you push them to each individual store. You get the option to choose which app stores you wish to publish on and the best part is that it&#8217;s completely free to use. In case you have any further queries, you can check out the <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/category/tutorials/\">tutorial</a> linked above to start distributing your games with UDP.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-328611 size-full\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Unity-Distribution-Portal.jpg\" alt=\"Unity Distribution Portal supported app stores\" width=\"874\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Unity-Distribution-Portal.jpg 874w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Unity-Distribution-Portal-300x153.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Unity-Distribution-Portal-768x391.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" /></p>\n<p>UDP works closely with several app stores, including Samsung Galaxy Store, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/appgallery-huawei-alternative-google-play-store-android/\">Huawei AppGallery</a>, Xiaomi GetApps, QooApp, Uptodown, SHAREit, ONE store, TPAY Mobile, and more to help you easily distribute your games on multiple platforms.

The smartwatches take about 2 hours to fully charge and are charged by connecting to the 2 Pin Pogo Pin connector on the magnetic charging base.  This kind of battery life isn&#8217;t typical of <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/android-wear\">Wear OS</a> smartwatches, so you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to hear that the Zepp E smartwatches run Zepp&#8217;s proprietary smartwatch OS.

Scroll to the bottom for more information. The article as published on August 4, 2020, is preserved below.</p></div>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Last year, we learned that Google was preparing a new file-sharing service for Android. This file-sharing service was originally called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/fast-share-android-beam-airdrop-android/\">Fast Share</a>&#8221; during early iterations, but Google eventually rebranded it to &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/fast-share-google-upcoming-airdrop-service-renamed-nearby-sharing/\">Nearby Share</a>&#8221; during the course of development. We got an <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/nearby-sharing-airdrop-for-android-file-sharing/\">early glimpse of the feature</a> in January, and in late June, Google started <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/android-nearby-share-beta-airdrop-feature/\">testing the service</a> with a handful of users on the latest Google Play Services beta release. Today, Google has announced that they are finally rolling out Nearby Share to millions of Android smartphones running Android 6.0 and above.</p>\n<p>For those unaware, Android has never had a simple, fast, <em>and</em> unified way to share files between devices. <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/google-deprecate-android-beam-api-nfc-share-files/\">Until Android 10</a>, most Android devices did have access to Android Beam, a file-sharing service that required users to tap their phones together to initiate a handshake over NFC followed by a file transfer over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct. Android Beam is, however, deprecated, clunkier, and slower than AirDrop, the file-sharing service on iOS that&#8217;s been around for years and is used by millions of iPhone and iPad users. AirDrop lets you quickly share files with any fellow iPhone or iPad users that are nearby. There <em>are</em> file-sharing services on Android that are arguably as simple and fast as AirDrop, but they all either require users to either download a third-party app or own a device from a specific smartphone manufacturer. Google is uniquely equipped to roll out a simple, fast, and unified file-sharing service thanks to its control over Google Play Services, which is installed on the vast majority of Android devices sold outside of China regardless of the manufacturer. That&#8217;s exactly what Nearby Share is—a simple, fast, and unified file-sharing service for Android.</p>\n<p>With Nearby Share, Android users can quickly share files to nearby users with the tap of a button. After tapping the &#8220;share&#8221; button in an app, users can share file(s) by selecting the &#8220;Nearby Share&#8221; option. Nearby users will then get a notification that someone wants to share content with them. Users will always have the option to &#8220;accept&#8221; or &#8220;decline&#8221; the file, so files are never transferred without explicit confirmation. After tapping &#8220;accept&#8221;, the file(s) are transferred using the best available communication protocol: Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, WebRTC, or peer-to-peer WiFi. Thus, files can be shared even when the sender and recipient devices are both fully offline.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-320031\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-Demo.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"244\" /></p>\n<p>Google designed this feature with privacy in mind. You can send and receive files anonymously, for example. You can also choose which contacts (all, some, or none) are able to immediately see you when you turn on Nearby Share.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-320035\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-Settings.jpg\" alt=\"Nearby Share device visibility settings\" width=\"535\" height=\"724\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-Settings.jpg 887w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-Settings-222x300.jpg 222w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-Settings-757x1024.jpg 757w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-Settings-768x1039.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\" /></p>\n<p>Perhaps the best part of Nearby Share is that Google is making it cross-platform. While we don&#8217;t know about iOS compatibility, Google confirmed they&#8217;re working to expand the feature to additional platforms. The company confirmed that feature will work with Chromebooks in the coming months. In fact, it&#8217;s already <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/chrome-os-supports-google-nearby-share-file-sharing-feature/\">available on Chrome OS</a> if you enable a few feature flags. More general OS support, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/androids-nearby-share-now-works-windows-google-chrome/\">such as Windows</a>, will be available via Google Chrome.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-320033 size-full\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-with-Chromebook.jpg\" alt=\"Nearby Share between Android and Chrome OS\" width=\"1200\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-with-Chromebook.jpg 1200w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-with-Chromebook-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-with-Chromebook-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Android-Nearby-Share-with-Chromebook-768x374.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></p>\n<p>Starting today, select <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel\">Google Pixel</a> and Samsung Galaxy smartphones running Android 6.0 or later will start getting Nearby Share. Since this feature is baked into Google Play Services, it&#8217;ll eventually become available for more Android smartphones. Check out <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/androids-nearby-share-now-works-windows-google-chrome/\">this support page</a> for more information on how the feature works.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Update: Google Nearby Share now rolling out widely</h2>\n<p>It appears that Google is rolling out Nearby Share more widely. We&#8217;ve spotted the feature on several devices now, like the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro, OnePlus Nord, Nubia Red Magic 5S, and LG Velvet. All of these devices are running Google Play Services 20.30.19 stable. Other users with OnePlus, Xiaomi, Honor, Realme, and Nokia phones have also mentioned that they have received the feature.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-329205\" src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_20200830-225849401-1-505x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"505\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_20200830-225849401-1-505x1024.jpg 505w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_20200830-225849401-1-148x300.jpg 148w, https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/08/Screenshot_20200830-225849401-1.jpg 592w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" /></p>\n<p>To access Nearby Share, go to Settings &#62; Google &#62; Device Connections &#62; Nearby Share, or Settings &#62; Connected Devices &#62; Connection Preferences &#62; Nearby Share (this menu isn&#8217;t available on all OS versions and/or OEM skins).

Once you pay off the contract and use the device on the network for at least 40 days, you’re eligible to perform a <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/support/plans-features/t-mobile-device-unlock-app\">SIM unlock</a>. After SIM unlocking, you need to <a href=\"https://support.oneplus.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/588/~/how-to-unlock-bootloader-for-oneplus-smart-phone\">generate a unique unlock token</a> to be able to unlock the bootloader.
