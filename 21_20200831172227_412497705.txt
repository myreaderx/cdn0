The studio posted this video online after the ABC News TV special <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/chadwick-boseman-tv-special-tribute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that aired last night</a> following a commercial-free airing of <em>Black Panther</em>.</p>\n<p>Culled from behind the scenes footage and publicity interviews, the video features Marvel Studios boss <strong>Kevin Feige</strong>, producer <strong>Nate Moore</strong>, <em>Black Panther</em> director <strong>Ryan Coogler</strong> and Marvel cast members <strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong>, <strong>Chris Evans</strong>, <strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong>, <strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong> and more talking about what Chadwick Boseman brought to the screen as the King T&#8217;Challa of Wakanda.</p>\n<p>Along with the video tribute to the late actor, <em>Black Panther</em> director Ryan Coogler wrote an extensive, beautiful, heartwarming tribute to the actor, not just for his work on the Marvel movie, but for the man he was. Over at <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-panther-director-ryan-coogler-pens-emotional-beautiful-tribute-to-chadwick-boseman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Coogler wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I haven’t grieved a loss this acute before. I spent the last year preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say, that we weren’t destined to see. It leaves me broken knowing that I won’t be able to watch another close-up of him in the monitor again or walk up to him and ask for another take.</p>\n<p>It hurts more to know that we can’t have another conversation, or Facetime, or text message exchange. He would send vegetarian recipes and eating regimens for my family and me to follow during the pandemic.  He would check in on me and my loved ones, even as he dealt with the scourge of cancer.</p>\n<p>In African cultures we often refer to loved ones that have passed on as ancestors. Sometimes you are genetically related. Sometimes you are not. I had the privilege of directing scenes of Chad’s character, T’Challa, communicating with the ancestors of Wakanda. We were in Atlanta, in an abandoned warehouse, with bluescreens, and massive movie lights, but Chad’s performance made it feel real. I think it was because from the time that I met him, the ancestors spoke through him. It’s no secret to me now how he was able to skillfully portray some of our most notable ones. I had no doubt that he would live on and continue to bless us with more. But it is with a heavy heart and a sense of deep gratitude to have ever been in his presence, that I have to reckon with the fact that Chad is an ancestor now. And I know that he will watch over us, until we meet again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can read the rest of Coogler&#8217;s magnificent tribute to Chadwick Boseman <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-panther-director-ryan-coogler-pens-emotional-beautiful-tribute-to-chadwick-boseman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over here</a>.

Those who regard the mere <em>mention</em> of a twist to be itself a spoiler are going to have a lot of trouble with this one, as the twists and turns are baked into the narrative. The film simply wouldn&#8217;t exist without them. And while we wouldn&#8217;t dream of giving away what those big twists are, it&#8217;s safe to say that <em>Antebellum</em> lives or dies by how willing you are to play along with the film&#8217;s bag of tricks. Suffice to say, we won&#8217;t be giving away any of the film&#8217;s twists here – no more so than <em>Antebellum</em>&#8216;s trailers have, at least.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-634378\"></span></p>\n<p>Written and directed by <strong>Gerard Bush</strong> and <strong>Christopher Renz</strong>, a promising duo who will hopefully go on to even bigger and better things, <em>Antebellum</em> opens with brutality, and almost never lets up. We&#8217;re dropped into a scene on a Civil War plantation, where runaway slaves have just been brought back and are about to suffer mightily for their transgressions. Bush and Renz let it be known right away that they&#8217;re not messing around here.</p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t want to downplay the cruelty, and that makes <em>Antebellum</em> feel all the more raw and essential, especially right now, as the country finds itself in the midst of wide-spread, and more than justified, protests against racial injustice. With everything going on right now, there might be some who look to <em>Antebellum</em> as the movie of the moment, but that&#8217;s not really what it is. It&#8217;s more of a somewhat sturdy thriller that probably would&#8217;ve worked better as an episode of <em>Black Mirror</em> or <em>The Twilight Zone</em> instead of a feature film.</p>\n<p>Living on the plantation is Eden, played by <strong>Janelle Monáe</strong> in yet another crackerjack performance. Monáe has quickly proven herself to be a star, and she does some of her best acting to date here, turning in a bold, unflinching performance that&#8217;s without question the highlight of the entire film. Slaves newly arrived at the plantation look to Eden for guidance, but all she can tell them is to keep their heads down and keep quiet. She knows how bad things can get here, and she&#8217;s forever under the watchful eye of Confederate soldier Jasper (<strong>Jack Huston</strong>, delivering all his lines through a cruel sneer) and the plantation&#8217;s owner, played by <strong>Jena Malone</strong>, who sinks her teeth into her unapologetically vile character. When a new arrival (<strong>Kiersey Clemons</strong>) shows up in chains, she almost immediately starts pressing Eden to help her to escape, but Eden is hesitant. She&#8217;s seen what happens to those who attempt to flee the plantation, and she&#8217;s petrified.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we&#8217;re also dropped into a different story, set in the present day. Sociologist and author Veronica Henley (also Monáe) is successful and in high-demand, appearing on CNN and delivering sold-out lectures about institutional racism in America. She heads out to a conference and checks into what appears to be a 4-star hotel – but the service is anything but hospitable. The person at the front desk is dismissive, there&#8217;s a creepy child roaming the hallway, and just about everything here seems <em>off</em> – although her white friend Sarah (<strong>Lily Cowles</strong>), staying at the same hotel, says she hasn&#8217;t noticed anything wrong at all.</p>\n<p>Just how the present-day material connects with the Civil War storyline is up to the viewer to discover, but it must be said that <em>Antebellum</em> never manages to stick that landing. Bush and Renz&#8217;s direction is loaded with style, and imagery that one might even dare call iconic – Monáe carrying a torch while standing in front of a huge, full moon; Monáe galloping on a horse in slow motion. And all of that is cloaked in an abundance of very real horrors that are not for the squeamish.</p>\n<p>And yet&#8230;<em>Antebellum</em> feels curiously unfinished. Rushed, even. You catch a <em>glimpse</em> of what the filmmakers are going for here, but never entirely buy it. &#8220;We made this film because we had not seen movies that dealt with slavery through the prism of horror,&#8221; Renz said of the film, while Bush adding: &#8220;Horror is not always science fiction or based on the supernatural; there’s plenty of horror in our history and present day, and that’s what we’d like audiences to experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is no doubt a unique approach, but <em>Antebellum</em>&#8216;s two halves – past and present – fail to effectively line-up or coalesce. The Civil War-era material is far stronger; more well-thought-out. It gets to the point where you almost wish Bush and Renz had jettisoned the modern-day storyline completely and worked to shore up the strong stuff they already had.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 6 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/antebellum-review/\">&#8216;Antebellum&#8217; Review: Janelle Monáe Delivers a Bold Performance in an Otherwise Jumbled Thriller</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ktLne32UEtY:-yXTzCmSFs8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ktLne32UEtY:-yXTzCmSFs8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ktLne32UEtY:-yXTzCmSFs8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ktLne32UEtY:-yXTzCmSFs8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ktLne32UEtY:-yXTzCmSFs8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ktLne32UEtY:-yXTzCmSFs8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ktLne32UEtY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:00:04 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/antebellum-review-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"d1a4f0877d79a5d819c497cfdf56fc15","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn14@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-55-983_4e8411b2f7f85493.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":21660,"destBytes":12560,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/antebellum-review-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn14@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-55-983_4e8411b2f7f85493.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn5@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-57-266_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ktLne32UEtY:-yXTzCmSFs8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn38@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-57-235_742eecf8375b4ca5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-57-239_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ktLne32UEtY:-yXTzCmSFs8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn43@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-21-57-240_4edc859423d9e406.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ktLne32UEtY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn27@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-57-203_2ab4a165250eaee4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894515540},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:55","title":"‘The Stand’ Trailer: Stephen King’s Vision of a Pandemic Apocalypse Comes to CBS All Access","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=634368","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-634369\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-1-700x271.jpg\" alt=\"the stand trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-1-700x271.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-1-360x139.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-1-768x297.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-1.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>When Stephen King penned <strong><em>The Stand</em> </strong>in 1978, which follows a group of survivors trying to build a new society in the wake of a deadly pandemic, he probably didn&#8217;t predict that a limited series adaptation of his apocalyptic fantasy novel would come out in the midst of a pandemic in 2020.

Now he&#8217;s back with even more terror with the next installment of the horror anthology series, <strong><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em></strong>. Don&#8217;t worry if you haven&#8217;t seen the first series, because this takes place in a completely different setting, in an entirely different decade, and follows a whole new set of characters. But as the trailer eerily illustrates, all the creepiness you loved about the first series is still here, and it will arrive just in time to spook up your October.<span id=\"more-634375\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Haunting of Bly Manor Teaser</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxeiY2W03Mc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The trailer opens with just a quick bit of voiceover saying, &#8220;I have a story. A ghost story.&#8221; Then we get a haunting tune sung by children with chilling voices as we see a montage of suspense-inducing scenes and unnerving imagery. It&#8217;s pretty standard horror fare, but in the hands of Flanagan, we know it won&#8217;t be just a series of cliches in every episode. This time, the series is driven by a gothic romance based on the ghost stories of Henry James, which is quite a change of pace from the first season. Plus, the 1980s setting should give it a different kind of vibe too.</p>\n<p><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em> stars <span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\"><strong>Victoria Pedretti</strong>, <strong>Henry Thomas</strong>, <strong>Oliver Jackson-Cohen</strong>, <strong>Kate Siegel</strong>, <strong>T&#8217;Nia Miller</strong>, <strong>Rahul Kohli</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Evan Ainsworth</strong>, <strong>Amelie Smith</strong> and <strong>Amelia Eve</strong>. </span>The series is executive produced by <strong>Mike Flanagan</strong> and <strong>Trevor Macy</strong> through Intrepid Pictures and <strong>Darryl Frank</strong> and <strong>Justin Falvey</strong> for Amblin Television.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>From The Haunting of Hill House creator Mike Flanagan and producer Trevor Macy comes THE HAUNTING OF BLY MANOR, the next highly anticipated chapter of The Haunting anthology series, set in 1980s England. After an au pair’s tragic death, Henry Wingrave (Henry Thomas) hires a young American nanny (Victoria Pedretti) to care for his orphaned niece and nephew (Amelie Bea Smith, Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) who reside at Bly Manor with the estate’s chef Owen (Rahul Kohli), groundskeeper Jamie (Amelia Eve) and housekeeper, Mrs. Grose (T’Nia Miller). But all is not as it seems at the manor, and centuries of dark secrets of love and loss are waiting to be unearthed in this chilling gothic romance. At Bly Manor, dead doesn’t mean gone.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em> arrives on Netflix on <strong>October 9, 2020</strong>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/haunting-of-bly-manor-trailer/\">&#8216;The Haunting of Bly Manor&#8217; Trailer: Netflix&#8217;s &#8216;Hill House&#8217; Follow-Up Invites Us Into a New Ghost Story</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4vTT4A2gsxg:dbnSxqOB2aA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4vTT4A2gsxg:dbnSxqOB2aA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4vTT4A2gsxg:dbnSxqOB2aA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4vTT4A2gsxg:dbnSxqOB2aA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4vTT4A2gsxg:dbnSxqOB2aA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4vTT4A2gsxg:dbnSxqOB2aA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4vTT4A2gsxg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:30:26 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hauntingofblymanor-girl-shh-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"7ba22e3e1b98e67e01b782601384912d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-21-55-794_c715fb8dadf01d42.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":22879,"destBytes":10934,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hauntingofblymanor-girl-shh-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-21-55-794_c715fb8dadf01d42.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn5@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-57-266_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4vTT4A2gsxg:dbnSxqOB2aA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-21-57-404_f491b02368b5d2c7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-57-239_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4vTT4A2gsxg:dbnSxqOB2aA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn83@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-21-57-269_c220a9103303c629.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4vTT4A2gsxg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-21-57-218_e229060b3da6a69d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894515540},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:55","title":"Cool Stuff: Baby Yoda Sips Soup as Gentle Giant’s New Statue from ‘The Mandalorian’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=634354","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-634357 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-babyyoda-soup-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandalorian - Gentle Giant Baby Yoda Statue \" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-babyyoda-soup-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-babyyoda-soup-360x155.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-babyyoda-soup-768x330.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-babyyoda-soup.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>As if there wasn&#8217;t already a plethora of <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong> merchandise out there, Gentle Giant is giving Baby Yoda another collectible that can adorn your shelf.

But most exciting is seeing protagonist <strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong> jump into action as Paul Atreides, who begins his desert odyssey with the help of <strong>Zendaya</strong>&#8216;s mysterious Fremen tribeswoman Chani, who has glowing blue eyes.</p>\n<p>Debuted by <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/dune-timothee-chalamet-on-the-awe-inspiring-desert-shoot-exclusive-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Empire</a> in their recent <em>Dune</em> issue, the images give us a sense of the epic scale of Villeneuve&#8217;s film, in contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dune-first-look-timothee-chalamet/\">first images</a> that were a little more on the subdued side. The interview with Chalamet, who makes a major pivot from arthouse dramas like <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> and <em>Little Women</em>, also teases some of the more action-packed parts of the film, with the actor describing a sequence they shot at Wadi Rum, a desert valley in Jordan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That part of the Wadi Rum is so awe-inspiring, you might as well be getting chased by that cliff in the background,&#8221; Chalamet described. &#8220;It wasn’t a green-screen or anything. That’s one of the most thrilling parts of the book and the movie. We had the sketches. That was a lesson for me. On a <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> or <em>Beautiful Boy</em> it can be counterintuitive to see the storyboards because then maybe you limit yourself based on a camera angle or whatever. It’s the opposite [here] because, for a sequence with the sandworm chasing you, I could never imagine that.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"\">Also starring in <em>Dune&#8217;s </em>ridiculously good-looking cast are<strong> Rebecca Ferguson </strong>as Paul’s mother Jessica, <strong>Stellan Skarsgard</strong> as Baron Harkonnen, <strong>Javier Bardem</strong> as Stilgar, <strong>Sharon Duncan-Brewster</strong> as Liet-Kynes, <strong>Charlotte Rampling</strong> as Reverend Mother Mohiam, <strong>David Dastmcalchian</strong> as Piter De Vries, <strong>Chang Chen </strong>as Dr. Yueh, and <strong>Dave Bautista </strong>as the Baron’s nephew Rabban.</p>\n<p><em>Dune</em> arrives in theaters on <strong>December 18</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, <em>Dune</em> tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people.

In addition to leading the first superhero movie nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, Boseman played real life historical figures such as Jackie Robinson in <strong><em>42</em></strong>, James Brown in <strong><em>Get On Up</em></strong>, and Thurgood Marshall in <strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>. Aside from his remarkable performances, Boseman also left behind a legacy of some wise and beautiful words that we wanted to pay tribute to below.<span id=\"more-634344\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SgASaCn8XXs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>First up, listen to Chadwick Boseman&#8217;s acceptance speech when the cast of Black Panther won the equivalent of the Screen Actors Guild&#8217;s award for Best Picture. In the speech (via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgASaCn8XXs&#38;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TNT</a>), Boseman explains what it means to be young, gifted, and Black in Hollywood, and focuses on whether or not the attention given to <em>Black Panther</em> means that the industry is changing for the better when it comes to representation and diversity for Black actors, actresses and filmmakers.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIHZypMyQ2s?start=26&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Next up, listen to Chadwick Boseman&#8217;s powerful speech he gave to the graduates of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIHZypMyQ2s&#38;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Howard University</a> in 2018. In this speech, Boseman told those students moving on to the next chapter of their lives:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Graduating class, hear me well on this day. This day, when you have reached the hilltop and you are deciding on next jobs, next steps, careers, further education, you would rather find purpose than a job or career. Purpose crosses disciplines. Purpose is an essential element of you. It is the reason you are on the planet at this particular time in history. Your very existence is wrapped up in the things you are here to fulfill. Whatever you choose for a career path, remember, the struggles along the way are only meant to shape you for your purpose. When I dared to challenge the system that would relegate us to victims and stereotypes with no clear historical backgrounds, no hopes or talents, when I questioned that method of portrayal, a different path opened up for me, the path to my destiny.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Watch the entire speech to hear the challenges Chadwick Boseman endured as a young Black actor.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J-D86wfxiE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Finally, during the publicity tour for <em>Black Panther</em>, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J-D86wfxiE&#38;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sirius XM</a> interview with the cast of the film found Chadwick Boseman reflecting on the importance of the character he stepped up to play. Specifically, Boseman was moved by a pair of young cancer patients who were doing everything they could to hold on to life so they could see Black Panther. Listen to the moving story that brings the actor to tears, and remember that during this time, Chadwick Boseman was already fighting cancer himself.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-morning-watch-in-the-words-of-chadwick-boseman/\">The Morning Watch: In the Words of Chadwick Boseman (1976-2020)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FN9mtR8Jx1k:qHRQSiy7Pn8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FN9mtR8Jx1k:qHRQSiy7Pn8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FN9mtR8Jx1k:qHRQSiy7Pn8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FN9mtR8Jx1k:qHRQSiy7Pn8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FN9mtR8Jx1k:qHRQSiy7Pn8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FN9mtR8Jx1k:qHRQSiy7Pn8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FN9mtR8Jx1k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/chadwickboseman-howarduniversity-700x324.jpg","linkMd5":"dd958c84537ec2507de952e1f3df22ab","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-55-715_05650181dbf002c9.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":324,"sourceBytes":21987,"destBytes":12464,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/chadwickboseman-howarduniversity-700x324.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-55-715_05650181dbf002c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn5@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-57-266_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FN9mtR8Jx1k:qHRQSiy7Pn8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-59-194_8d481341bc2e4526.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-57-239_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FN9mtR8Jx1k:qHRQSiy7Pn8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn2@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-58-804_9a0ef69a4b07110f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FN9mtR8Jx1k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn53@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-22-04-865_3228445536a4ac4a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894515540},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:55","title":"‘The New Mutants’ Tops the Slowly Growing Box Office with $7 Million Opening","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=634392","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-461781 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-mutants-rating-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-mutants-rating.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-mutants-rating-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>The New Mutants</em></strong> became the first major studio title to get a theatrical released in the middle of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. With somewhere between 60%-70% of movie theaters across the United States opened, <strong><em>The New Mutants</em></strong> was only able to muster up a $7 million opening weekend, with ticket sales being on the lower end of the expectations of Disney and 20th Century Studios. But even so, it&#8217;s the biggest debut for a movie since the pandemic began in the US back in March.<span id=\"more-634392\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/box-office-new-mutants-bill-and-ted-1234753888/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> and Deadline have the box office numbers from this past weekend, which have <em>The New Mutants</em> landing easily at the top after playing in 2,412 theaters. Considering the situation we&#8217;re in right now due to the coronavirus pandemic, not to mention the long road to theaters for this movie, the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-mutants-behind-the-scenes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stories of production woes</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-new-mutants-review-a-middling-movie-that-works-best-with-lowered-expectations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bad reviews that it earned</a> in the days leading up to release, a $7 million opening probably isn&#8217;t terrible, even if it opened below expectations. Especially with theaters in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington DC, New Jersey and New York still closed.</p>\n<p>However, in overseas markets where movie theaters have been open for a little longer, <em>The New Mutants</em> was only able to pick up another $2.9 million. Even so, Cathleen Taff, Disney’s president of global distribution, is looking on the positive side of things. She said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re encouraged by the results. We didn’t expect everyone to come back to the movies at once, but there’s clearly an appetite. It’s not a linear process. We have to stay fluid and work with the framework of this new reality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Disney and 20th Century Studios would surely have preferred to open <em>The New Mutants</em> in more theaters at a time when people weren&#8217;t hesitant about going to them, getting at least some kind of return from the box office will be welcome. But one has to wonder how much more they would have made if they just released the movie on premium VOD at the same time. There&#8217;s always a chance they&#8217;ll see the numbers and change their mind, but I imagine they&#8217;re trying to give theaters something to help hold them over. Thankfully<em>, Tenet</em> arrives later this week, and while we don&#8217;t want to actively encourage anyone to go to theaters right now, that will definitely help movie theaters during this difficult economic time.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the box office, <strong><em>Unhinged</em></strong> came in second place, adding another $2.6 million to its box office total. <strong><em>Bill and Ted Face the Music</em></strong> made a respectable debut in third place with $1.06 million, with drive-ins contributing to the bulk of that total. Numbers for the premium VOD release have not been released yet, but it was #1 on iTunes charts, following by the three-pack of all the Bill &#38; Ted movies at #2, so it must have done pretty well.</p>\n<p>Coming in with totals under a million, we&#8217;ve got <strong><em>The Personal History of David Copperfield</em></strong> from Veep creator Armano Iannucci chiming in with $520,000, and the teen drama <strong><em>Words on Bathroom Walls </em></strong>making just over over $453,000. <strong><em>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run</em> </strong>is still kicking around in Canada too, pulling in around $400,000.</p>\n<p>These are paltry box office numbers, even for late August, but that&#8217;s to be expected with the way things are being handled in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. However, this weekend should see a surge as more theaters open for Labor Day weekend and Tenet brings people out of the woodwork.

The team has been awarded junior varsity hockey scholarships to Eden Hall Academy, a prestigious prep school that was previously attended by Coach Gordon Bombay. But this time, Coach Bombay isn&#8217;t leading the ducks on the hockey rink. Instead, the Ducks have to get used to Coach Ted Orion, a former NHL player who has no patience for the little tricks the team used to pull, while also contending with the contempt and taunts of the varsity hockey team.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Essential Viewing</strong>: <em>The Mighty Ducks</em> is one of those beloved sports franchises that children of the 1990s adore. <em>D2: The Mighty Ducks</em> ups the ante by taking the team to the global level and having them face off with the best young hockey players the world has to offer, while also adding some players who aren&#8217;t from District 5 in Minnesota. The movies have all the cliched lessons you&#8217;d expect from these kind of family friendly sports dramas, and while <em>D3: The Mighty Ducks</em> has those too, what makes the sequel stand out is the coming-of-age narrative that finds the characters growing up along with the fans who have been with them since the beginning.<span id=\"more-634360\"></span></p>\n<p>As a kid, I used to hate Coach Orion. I empathized with Charlie Conway when he told his new coach, &#8220;You&#8217;re the rookie here. We&#8217;ve all been together for four years.&#8221; Sure, it was clear that Conway was a little too cocky for his own good, especially when it came to choosing only to concentrate on offense instead of also putting up a good defense. But Orion seemed like a guy who didn&#8217;t respect the legacy of The Mighty Ducks that came before. As an adult, it&#8217;s clear to see that this movie is about the team coming to terms with the fact that they&#8217;re not kids anymore. Not only will their usual antics like &#8220;The Flying V&#8221; fail on the ice now, but they can&#8217;t keep riding on their previous accolades, and they need to learn to adapt at the curveballs (or knucklepucks) that life throws at them. Even the lack of skill seen from goalie Greg Goldberg is finally addressed.</p>\n<p>Obviously, none of this is groundbreaking. But this is the first movie that really forces The Mighty Ducks to evolve as characters, not just hockey players. Though the first two movies saw the team grow on the ice, learning lessons about teamwork and whatnot, most of the character development fell upon Emilio Estevez as Gordon Bombay. With their coach taking a backseat and only appearing in a few key scenes, the weight of character development falls upon Charlie Conway and the rest of the team. Sure, there are still goofy antics, but this movie has more bubbling under the surface of the ice, even if the overall pond isn&#8217;t that deep.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that I can definitively say that <em>D3: The Mighty Ducks</em> is the best in the series, especially since much of the dramatic weight relies upon the movies that came before it, including the last minute surprise of Bash Brother Dean Portman showing up in the middle of the final game to claim his Eden Hall scholarship. But I think it&#8217;s the most mature movie out of the entire franchise and it really lets the Ducks take flight in a way they haven&#8217;t before. If you haven&#8217;t watched it recently, it might be worth revisiting.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-d3-the-mighty-ducks/\">The Quarantine Stream: I Used to Think &#8216;D3: The Mighty Ducks&#8217; Was the Worst of the Series, But It Might Be the Best</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_8o7NigLtF0:GYfEc3bbUi0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_8o7NigLtF0:GYfEc3bbUi0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_8o7NigLtF0:GYfEc3bbUi0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_8o7NigLtF0:GYfEc3bbUi0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_8o7NigLtF0:GYfEc3bbUi0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_8o7NigLtF0:GYfEc3bbUi0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_8o7NigLtF0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:00:31 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/d3-mightyducks-charlie-coachorion-700x314.jpg","linkMd5":"a20310f8c8a311ea4eef23e68a3f949e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-55-727_21d71d20a165e191.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":314,"sourceBytes":36528,"destBytes":23570,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/d3-mightyducks-charlie-coachorion-700x314.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-55-727_21d71d20a165e191.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn5@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-57-266_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_8o7NigLtF0:GYfEc3bbUi0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_1/2020/08/31/17-21-57-264_3911f539f7711856.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/31/17-21-57-239_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_8o7NigLtF0:GYfEc3bbUi0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn47@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-21-57-376_48daf4db2d160777.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_8o7NigLtF0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn45@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-21-57-312_775a962c226398eb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598894515540}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:55","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:21:55","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:21:55 +0000","fetchMs":18,"handleMs":281,"totalMs":32067,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"4b117c0f3b7eed13bb1169338088aa32","hostName":"us-021*","requestId":"18e8f41d3c2b449997b6eea49960adaf_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":211618,"bgimgsTotal":9,"bgimgsGithubTotal":9,"articlesImgsTotal":42,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":42,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":2,"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx7":1,"myreaderx6":2,"myreaderx16":2,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx4":1,"myreaderx3":2,"myreaderx11":1,"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx12":2,"myreaderx2":2,"myreaderx1":2,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx31":1,"myreaderx18":2,"myreaderx19":2,"myreaderx":1,"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx21":2,"myreaderx22":2,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx24":2,"myreaderx5oss":1,"myreaderx29":2},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 01:13:36","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/22/17-13-36-873_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
