Chevrolet says that, working with NHTSA, it confirmed a total of five Bolt EV fires caused by this issue, which occurred when charging the cars' battery packs to full capacity.</p>\n<p>Affected owners should contact their local Chevrolet dealer to schedule the software fix, which is available later this week.
