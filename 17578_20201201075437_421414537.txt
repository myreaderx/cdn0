In a <a href=\"https://icom.museum/en/covid-19/surveys-and-data/survey-museums-and-museum-professionals/\">May report</a>, the International Council on Museums (ICOM) found that &#8220;nearly one-third of them [GLAM institutions] will reduce staff, and more than one-tenth may be forced to close permanently&#8221; due to forced closures and a reduction in ticket sales. Closures due to the pandemic have particularly affected institutions in African, Asian and the Arab countries. Many institutions across the world have since been forced to layoff large swaths of their staff and cut programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GLAM community also recognized that the pandemic would disrupt millions of children and young adults’ education and bar access to cultural heritage, amplifying existing inequalities and inequities.

For example, the majority of the GLAM workforce is still predominantly white, and issues of racial justice and equity are still hard to bring to the table. Colonialist practices extend to the digital realm, continuing to do harm to communities that have seen their heritage despoiled. That also includes Indigenous cultural heritage, as CC&#8217;s Brigitte Vézina and Alexis Muscat wrote in August, “Existing copyright law, steeped in Western concepts and values, does not adequately protect Indigenous traditional cultural expressions, nor does it sufficiently reflect or account for Indigenous cultural values.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open GLAM is not only about sharing cultural heritage by respecting copyright law, but also how to do it more responsibly, collaboratively, and equitably. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Creative Commons, we hope to help find solutions to these emerging and growing challenges through our Open GLAM work.
