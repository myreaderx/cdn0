You'd think that someone like <span class=\"misspell\">Ladytron</span>, who <strong><a href=\"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/149016-ladytron-and-the-faint-to-tour-together\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"will open\">will open</a> </strong> a few of <span class=\"misspell\">Depeche</span> Mode's Eastern European shows, would be a better fit, just based on the sense of elegant gloom they share.</p> \n<p>Then again, both <span class=\"misspell\">Depeche</span> Mode and PB&amp;J dress really well and know how to groove, so that's something.
