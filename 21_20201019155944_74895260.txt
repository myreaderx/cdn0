But thankfully, our favorite holiday hero is back to save Christmas with his awesome beard and sweet sax-playing skills. <strong>Kurt Russell</strong>&#8216;s badass Santa Claus returns in <strong><em>The Christmas Chronicles 2</em></strong>, the sequel to his hit 2018 holiday movie for Netflix, this time wielding a saxophone and some cool sunglasses. Watch <em>The Christmas Chronicles 2</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641809\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Christmas Chronicles 2 Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVzBwSOcBaI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Chris Columbus writes and directs <em>The Christmas Chronicles 2</em>, the sequel to Clay Kaytis&#8217; surprise hit <em>The Christmas Chronicles</em>, which starred Kurt Russell as an adventure-seeking Santa Claus. The first film was mostly a draw for the gimmick of Kurt Russell playing a badass Santa, and for the onscreen reunion of real-life couple Russell and Goldie Hawn, who last starred together in 1987&#8217;s <em>Overboard</em>.</p>\n<p>So Columbus has to up the ante with the sequel — and he does, this time making Santa even cooler by giving him a smooth sax solo, and by introducing a villain, played by <em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em>&#8216;s <strong>Julian Dennison</strong>, who plots to destroy the North Pole and end Christmas for good. But Mr. and Mrs. Claus have help in the form of step-siblings Kate (<strong>Darby Camp</strong>) and Jack (<strong>Jahzir Bruno</strong>), who step in to defend the North Pole with the help of exploding cookies and remarkably lethal toy guns. And yes, there are still plenty of those creepy CGI elf things running around in this sequel.</p>\n<p>In addition to Russell and Hawn, the cast includes Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Tyrese Gibson, Darlene Love with Judah Lewis.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>The Christmas Chronicles 2</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s been two years since siblings Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis) saved Christmas, and a lot has changed. Kate, now a cynical teenager, is reluctantly spending Christmas in Cancun with her mom&#8217;s new boyfriend (Tyrese Gibson) and his son Jack (Jahzir Bruno). Unwilling to accept this new version of her family, Kate decides to run away. But when a mysterious, magical troublemaker named Belsnickel threatens to destroy the North Pole and end Christmas for good, Kate and Jack are unexpectedly pulled into a new adventure with Santa Claus (Kurt Russell). Written and directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter) and co-starring Goldie Hawn, THE CHRISTMAS CHRONICLES: PART TWO is an action-packed adventure for the whole family that&#8217;s full of heart, humor, and holiday spirit.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Christmas Chronicles 2 </em>slides down the chimney to Netflix on <strong>November 25, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641850\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TCC2_Vertical_Main_RGB_EN-US-700x1037.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1037\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TCC2_Vertical_Main_RGB_EN-US-700x1037.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TCC2_Vertical_Main_RGB_EN-US-338x500.jpg 338w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TCC2_Vertical_Main_RGB_EN-US-768x1137.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TCC2_Vertical_Main_RGB_EN-US.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-christmas-chronicles-2-trailer/\">&#8216;The Christmas Chronicles 2&#8217; Trailer: Kurt Russell and His Sax Are Back to Save Christmas</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=useiQat4IYc:r0DlyK_ezZY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=useiQat4IYc:r0DlyK_ezZY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=useiQat4IYc:r0DlyK_ezZY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=useiQat4IYc:r0DlyK_ezZY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=useiQat4IYc:r0DlyK_ezZY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=useiQat4IYc:r0DlyK_ezZY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/useiQat4IYc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:30:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-christmas-chronicles-700x330.jpg","linkMd5":"991d4010a5902c67770ac8210af61532","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-07-864_01be35861d239e3e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":330,"sourceBytes":46608,"destBytes":32042,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-christmas-chronicles-700x330.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-07-864_01be35861d239e3e.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/TCC2_Vertical_Main_RGB_EN-US-700x1037.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn42@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-26-962_c3371b85bf950c0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn72@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-26-696_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=useiQat4IYc:r0DlyK_ezZY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn30@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-40-851_c667aef34cda11b6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-35-987_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=useiQat4IYc:r0DlyK_ezZY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-26-838_93322f2dc04d8df8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/useiQat4IYc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn92@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-26-681_8ad5a724a48d3aaf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123133339},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:53","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:53","title":"Cool Stuff: ‘The Bride of Frankenstein’ Lives Again with a New Vinyl Soundtrack and Spinature Collectible","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641795","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641799 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/brideoffrankenstein-vinylsoundtrack-cover-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bride of Frankenstein Vinyl Soundtrack\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/brideoffrankenstein-vinylsoundtrack-cover-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/brideoffrankenstein-vinylsoundtrack-cover-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>This year marks the 85th anniversary of the horror sequel <strong><em>The Bride of Frankenstein</em></strong>, the follow-up to the certified 1931 horror classic <strong><em>Frankenstein</em></strong>.

Will the season be a complete disaster, or will this charming underdog surprise the world?</p>\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Essential Quarantine Viewing: </strong>Over the past couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been hearing a slow trickle of buzz about <em>Ted Lasso</em>, this new Apple show starring <strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong>. Practically all of the reactions shared the same sentiment: after a reluctance to initially get on board with the show came a near-immediate love for it once people pressed play. Allow me to add my name to the chorus of new fans of <em>Ted Lasso</em>: this show is somehow better than you&#8217;ve heard.<span id=\"more-641724\"></span></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a super hot take you probably haven&#8217;t heard anywhere else: 2020 has not been the greatest year. But <em>Ted Lasso</em>, with its endearing characters, rapid-fire jokes, and infectious optimism, is a much-needed salve for these turbulent times. I&#8217;ve only seen seven of the first season&#8217;s eleven episodes so far, but barring some unforeseen catastrophic drop in quality, I&#8217;m confident this will end up being one of my favorite pieces of media this year.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re worried that a show about a soccer coach might require you to actually have a working knowledge of soccer, this series wisely uses the sport as a jumping off point and rarely focuses on the mechanics of the game itself. In fact, there&#8217;s a surprisingly small amount of time devoted to matches throughout the season. Instead, the show is much more concerned with the interpersonal relationships of the coach and his players, his fellow coaches, and the team&#8217;s owner.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a <em>Major League</em> vibe to the overarching plot, with a female owner (<strong>Hannah Waddingham</strong>) looking to purposefully tank her own team behind the scenes. But what seems like a cut and dried motivation is given more weight and dimension throughout the season as we&#8217;re introduced to the previous owner, her uber-wealthy ex-husband (a total prick who treats her like garbage). She initially views Ted as a means to a vindictive end, but his aw-shucks charm slowly begin to chip away at her tough exterior and slowly win her over.</p>\n<p>And while Ted&#8217;s goofy Midwestern niceties could be played entirely for laughs, Ted Lasso does something unexpected: it interrogates what it must be like for someone else to live with this person all the time, and what effect that over-the-top optimism might have on a marriage. That adds a layer of emotional depth and complexity to this otherwise hilarious comedy that I frankly was not ready for, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you shed a few tears along the way.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-ted-lasso-lives-up-to-the-hype/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;Ted Lasso&#8217; Lives Up to the Hype</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rLMnyK4cte0:2pO1v9SAdmU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rLMnyK4cte0:2pO1v9SAdmU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rLMnyK4cte0:2pO1v9SAdmU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rLMnyK4cte0:2pO1v9SAdmU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rLMnyK4cte0:2pO1v9SAdmU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rLMnyK4cte0:2pO1v9SAdmU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rLMnyK4cte0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:00:56 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ted-lasso-1-700x338.jpg","linkMd5":"7a41cc865e60019a0b24d40f0a6575b5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-58-57-110_508e31cddeb3b7b6.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":338,"sourceBytes":22107,"destBytes":12068,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ted-lasso-1-700x338.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-58-57-110_508e31cddeb3b7b6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn72@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-26-696_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rLMnyK4cte0:2pO1v9SAdmU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-26-731_221f719593fa27b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-35-987_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rLMnyK4cte0:2pO1v9SAdmU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-29-820_082c49994bb48009.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rLMnyK4cte0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn79@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-26-654_ebd673655ee476bd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123133338},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:53","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:53","title":"The Morning Watch: What Happened to Francis Ford Coppola, Aaron Sorkin Answers Screenwriting Questions & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641789","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-583462 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fracisfordcoppola-twixt-directing-700x323.jpg\" alt=\"Fracis Ford Coppola Criticizes Marvel Movies\" width=\"700\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fracisfordcoppola-twixt-directing-700x323.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fracisfordcoppola-twixt-directing-360x166.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fracisfordcoppola-twixt-directing-768x354.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fracisfordcoppola-twixt-directing.jpg 802w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-morning-watch/\">The Morning Watch</a> is a recurring feature that highlights a handful of noteworthy videos from around the web.

He tries everything from a ping-pong paddle to a comb for his face, but just can&#8217;t find the right fit&#8230;or the right name.</p>\n<p>Directed by Trent Correy (animation supervisor on Olaf in <em>Frozen 2</em>) and Dan Abraham (a veteran story artist who boarded Olaf’s “When I Am Older” musical sequence in <em>Frozen 2</em>), <em>Once Upon a Snowman</em> is produced by Nicole Hearon (associate producer on <em>Frozen 2</em>) with Peter Del Vecho (producer on <em>Frozen 2</em>). And of course, <strong>Josh Gad</strong> comes back to voice his breakout character, Olaf. It&#8217;s the latest of the Olaf shorts to come out on Disney+ during the pandemic, the first <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/at-home-with-olaf-disney-frozen-digital-series/\">few of which</a> were animated remotely by the Disney animation team, and voiced by Gad, from home. But <em>Once Upon a Snowman</em> was longer in the making, with Correy and Abraham conceiving of the idea all the way back during production on the first <em>Frozen</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an idea that started to form when I was an animator on the first <em>Frozen</em>,&#8221; said Correy. &#8220;Dan Abraham and I are so grateful and excited to have had the opportunity to direct this short, working with our incredible colleagues at Walt Disney Animation Studios.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis to <em>Once Upon a Snowman</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The previously untold origins of Olaf, the innocent and insightful, summer-loving snowman who melted hearts in the Academy Award®-winning 2013 Disney animated feature, Frozen, and its acclaimed 2019 sequel, are revealed in the all-new Walt Disney Animation Studios animated short, Once Upon a Snowman. The film follows Olaf’s first steps as he comes to life and searches for his identity in the snowy mountains outside Arendelle. Once Upon a Snowman is directed by Trent Correy (animation supervisor, “Olaf” in Frozen 2) and Dan Abraham (veteran story artist who boarded Olaf’s “When I Am Older” musical sequence in Frozen 2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Once Upon a Snowman </em>will debut exclusively on Disney+ <strong>October 23, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/once-upon-a-snowman-trailer/\">&#8216;Once Upon a Snowman&#8217; Trailer: Find Out Olaf&#8217;s Unlikely Beginnings in this &#8216;Frozen&#8217; Prequel Short</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=W2pRgs69Oh8:johu1Ed7JYQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=W2pRgs69Oh8:johu1Ed7JYQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=W2pRgs69Oh8:johu1Ed7JYQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=W2pRgs69Oh8:johu1Ed7JYQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=W2pRgs69Oh8:johu1Ed7JYQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=W2pRgs69Oh8:johu1Ed7JYQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/W2pRgs69Oh8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:00:21 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/once-upon-a-snowman-700x250.jpg","linkMd5":"b67514da79aa1a0e1833c7f0b954c945","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn13@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-14-073_25e71287360a2aba.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":250,"sourceBytes":12018,"destBytes":5284,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/once-upon-a-snowman-700x250.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn13@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-14-073_25e71287360a2aba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn72@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-26-696_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=W2pRgs69Oh8:johu1Ed7JYQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-43-311_0dc44355e31b1ae1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-35-987_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=W2pRgs69Oh8:johu1Ed7JYQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-26-855_07908d2416be71c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/W2pRgs69Oh8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-26-677_66302bdb2cf1d3d1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123133338},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:53","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:53","title":"Bruce Willis Returns as John McClane for a ‘Die Hard’ Car Battery Commercial","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641815","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641829 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/diehard-commercial-brucewillis-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Die Hard Car Battery Commercial\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/diehard-commercial-brucewillis.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/diehard-commercial-brucewillis-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The last time <strong>Bruce Willis</strong> reprised his role as John McClane in the <em><strong>Die Hard</strong></em> franchise, the results were disappointing to say the least. But over the weekend, fans were intrigued when the actor&#8217;s daughter, Rumer Willis, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therue/status/1317571150524735488\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted a teaser</a> for the return of the increasingly invincible detective. For some reason, many thought this was a tease for a new <em>Die Hard</em> movie that no one had heard about. However, it turns out it was just a tease for an expensive new advertisement with John McClane shilling <em>Die Hard</em> car batteries for Advance Auto Parts. But honestly, it&#8217;s still probably better than the entirety of <em>A Good Day to Die Hard</em>.</p>\n<p>Watch the <em>Die Hard</em> car battery commercial below and enjoy the cameos and Easter eggs throughout.<span id=\"more-641815\"></span></p>\n<h2>Die Hard Car Battery Commercial</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7kFGGFI9Xo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Bruce Willis doesn&#8217;t exactly appear to be acting his heart out here, but it does seem like he&#8217;s having fun, especially when he&#8217;s forced to climb through the vent of an Advance Auto Parts store, carrying a <em>Die Hard</em> car battery with the logo perfectly visible along with him.</p>\n<p>In an official press release accompanying the ad, Willis said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve never done any sort of commercial with the John McClane character, but Advance Auto Parts brought an idea to integrate DieHard the battery into the ‘Die Hard’ story through a short film that’s authentic to McClane and both brands. Advance approached this like a motion picture – the script is clever, the production intense and the spot is entertaining. This is what ‘Die Hard’ fans expect. I think they will dig the DieHard-‘Die Hard’ mashup.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Adding to the, uh, authenticity, is the return of the <em>Die Hard</em> bad guy Theo (<strong>Clarence Gilyard</strong>) and the limo driver Argyle (<strong>De’voreaux White</strong>). Where the hell have they been this entire time, eh? There are a few more Easter eggs and references to the original movie in there, and thankfully John McClane doesn&#8217;t complain a single time about this interrupting his vacation.</p>\n<p>This is a Super Bowl-level kind of commercial that debuted during the FOX broadcast of the Green Bay vs. Tampa Bay NFL game this weekend. So why not wait until the Big Game to put this ad out there? <strong>Jason McDonell</strong>, Advance Auto Parts Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Cold weather is coming. We know motorists will begin to encounter battery failure.
