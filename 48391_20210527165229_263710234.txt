Your current tool isn’t giving you the right data or functionalities</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accuracy and functionality are the biggest pain points SEO professionals have with their tools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does your current solution give you enough data? Does it provide the right data? If not, you may not be able to deliver on your SEO goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever come across either of these problems?</span></p>\n<h3>Unreliable or incomplete data</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some SEO platforms simply provide more data features than others, while others charge extra to view specific metrics, like:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google’s “(not provided)” data</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand/non-brand organic traffic segmentation</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile vs. desktop traffic</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having this data is invaluable for SEO professionals. But having to pay for it granularly can be a hugely limiting factor, particularly for smaller agencies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, mapping the traffic data from Google Analytics and matching it with the keyword data from Google Search Console to</span> <a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_sm_-not-provided\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get what’s “(not provided)”</a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">means you can show clients the direct impact which SEO has on other business goals – like how increasing ranking for a keyword affects conversions.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_sm_-organic-img\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-143318\" src=\"https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-1024x581.png\" alt=\"SEO tools and keyword rankings\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-1024x581.png 1024w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-300x170.png 300w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-768x436.png 768w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1.png 728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO platforms that provide this type of data as standard can give you an advantage when it comes to acquiring and retaining clients by highlighting the connection between SEO and business results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or it can be an issue of unreliable metrics – misleading or opaque calculations, issues that pertain to technical changes and not your SEO performance, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about the </span><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_lib_-visibility-metric\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visibility metric</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If it’s calculated as an average of positions for a set of keywords, then changes based on adding or deleting keywords on that list will be misleading, leaving you to figure out why the score fluctuates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul Wood, Director of </span><a href=\"https://www.indulgemedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Indulge Media</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>, </strong>points out that innovation in how an SEO tool calculates a key metric is a deciding factor. Even more so if it’s something the agency used to do with spreadsheets and many hours spent before finding out about such an efficient metric.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more interesting scenario is when you suddenly become aware of a tool that’s out there that does something your team didn’t even consider,” Wood said. “When you see it in a tool, that’s a moment when you change the way you’re thinking about things, about how you structure your work. And then you start to work differently.”</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_sm_-visibility-img\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-143328\" src=\"https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SEOmonitor.gif\" alt=\"SEOmonitor\" width=\"1058\" height=\"600\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is how the right SEO tools </span>should<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work – solving agency pain points, even the ones you might not have thought were possible to resolve.</span></p>\n<h3>Functionality issues</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speed is a huge factor in the SEO industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search professionals need access to accurate, up-to-date data in the moment to implement campaigns and track performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because when your software malfunctions, you need to get the problem solved </span>fast.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why it’s essential to consider the quality of support provided when selecting an SEO tool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, you should get access to a dedicated account manager who you can approach for quick resolution of issues on an as-needed basis, as well as regular support calls to review your agency’s needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Paul Friend, Head of SEO, and Ben Foster, Managing Director, from </span><a href=\"https://www.seoworks.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO Works</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> decided it’s time to choose a different core SEO tool, they scored ongoing and ad-hoc support as one of the “hundreds of different relevant aspects when selecting the right tool.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of their decisional matrix, this was one point that needed to match key functionalities like keyword features including universal rankings, overall market visibility scores, content insights, forecasting and reporting capabilities, link building capabilities, competition insights, and many more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, when you’re evaluating or considering upgrading your existing tech stack, you need to see how well a solution performs based on your agency’s specific needs.</span></p>\n<h2>2. You want to be seen as a leader in innovation</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital is always moving, and SEO professionals have to be up-to-date with new developments to remain competitive. Agencies need to be at the forefront of innovation, so they constantly lookout for new technologies that will set them apart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul Wood says that they “make an effort at least a few times a year to have a proper review of what’s out there in terms of tools.” They focus primarily on <a href=\"https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2021/04/12/ux-an-important-seo-ranking-factor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accessibility and UX</a> when assessing new tools on the market, like:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How easily they allow you to export data</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How they facilitate collaboration between internal teams and clients</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many functionalities can be integrated into a single platform</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team at SEO Works also highlights the importance of always being on the lookout, with members keeping each other informed. They have an extensive training program in place, too – so everyone is onboarded not only with the tools but the specific methodologies the agency uses for top-notch SEO strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going even further, agencies like SEO Works develop proprietary tools, showing how their innovative approach can be a competitive advantage for clients in their portfolio.</span></p>\n<h2>3. You’re growing or scaling your SEO agency</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital adoption has accelerated globally by at least three to four years in just a few months, according to a recent McKinsey Global Survey of C-level business leaders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This drive toward a digital-first approach is only expected to continue, which means that scaling needs for SEO agencies are likely to be high right now, as well as for the foreseeable future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meeting this growing demand for SEO services requires agencies to scale operations efficiently while also staying competitive themselves. If you’re growing your agency, it’s a good time to test your tools and see if they have the right set of functionalities to promote and support this growth.</span></p>\n<p><b>Fast-growing agencies need more capabilities, like:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Access to more users</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: As you add new clients and employees, you want tools that allow you to have unlimited users (ideally, at no extra cost) and facilitate collaboration across teams</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Unlimited API access</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Your SEO tools need to work seamlessly with your other business tools as you grow your overall technology toolkit. For example, we’ve made it as simple as possible to export large quantities of data through the SEOmonitor API, letting you pull the campaign and keyword-level data into your preferred internal systems (like Klipfolio) and customize client reports</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>More efficient workflows</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Operational dashboards, integrated systems, and organizing capabilities for your client portfolio, all make a difference in helping you </span><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_sm_-status-quo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get the status quo at a glance</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_sm_-cht-img\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-143320 size-large\" src=\"https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-1024x581.png\" alt=\"Fast growing agencies and their need for more capabilities in an SEO tool\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-1024x581.png 1024w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-300x170.png 300w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-768x436.png 768w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3.png 728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the words of many SEO professionals we’ve talked with, the highest value an SEO platform can bring is to help you not waste time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right tools will help you do this, but ineffective ones can leave your team spending too much time on technical processes, which will seriously impede your ability to scale.</span></p>\n<h2>4. Your tool isn’t collaborative enough or customizable</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO professionals need to have stable processes and methodologies across all teams. The best software is built with this in mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collaboration and customization are the most important things that agencies prioritize when choosing SEO tools. And lots of features facilitate this, like:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Multiple user access</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Unlimited access for team members and clients, with customizable client view permissions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Collaborative features</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Real-time annotations, comments, and sharing capabilities for both teams and clients.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Tracking metrics</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A centralized </span><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_lib_-agency-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agency</a><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_lib_-agency-dashboard\"> dashboard</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that lets teams monitor performance and tasks, as well as align on goals.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Personalization features</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: From filtering campaigns by account managers, to an editing mode that optimizes your time for keyword management, to saving customized reporting templates across the agency, there are many capabilities you should consider.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_sm_-dashboard-img\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-143321\" src=\"https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-1024x581.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-1024x581.png 1024w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-300x170.png 300w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-768x436.png 768w, https://www.searchenginewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4.png 728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A robust SEO solution, which combines multiple functionalities like these in a single platform, helps optimize internal workflows and gain a holistic view into agency operations.</span></p>\n<h2>5. Your tool isn’t cost-effective</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different sized agencies have different budgets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimizing costs is crucial, particularly for scaling agencies. You have to hire more people and use more resources in your tools to handle a larger volume of clients, and you don’t want to scale your costs at the same rate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some questions to ask when evaluating the cost-efficiency of a particular tool are:</span></p>\n<h3><b>Does it offer flexible pricing and use of resources?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most SEO software solutions have a fixed subscription cost, which includes a set number of domains and keywords. But if your use of the tool’s resources fluctuates from month to month, your pricing remains the same.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other platforms give agencies the ability to upgrade or downgrade each month, so you only </span><a href=\"https://seoai.net/sew-25-_sm_-flexible-pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pay for what you use</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Having no predefined plan supports agencies better evaluate their expenses based on campaign volume on a specific timeframe.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Are there any extra hidden costs?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some tools have an attractive base price but come with hidden costs and extras that can quickly add up, especially when you’re onboarding lots of new clients and handling larger campaigns.
