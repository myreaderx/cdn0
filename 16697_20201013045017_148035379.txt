Most of the time, this will require you to seek out a good auto body repair shop, but that in itself can be stressful. You can no doubt find a good auto body shop if you enter &#8220;<a href=\"https://jewellcollision.com/about/\">auto body shop Lakewood CO</a>&#8221; in Google, but you should still ask the right questions of any auto body shop before you decide to do business with them. As always, you should be following your own gut instincts when it comes to choosing a good shop, but here are some of the questions you should be asking.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What Credentials Do You Have?</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the best ways to find out about the quality of an auto body shop&#8217;s work is to ask about their credentials. Most reputable shops will be certified by AAA, the National Institute of Automotive Service Excellence, the Inter-Industry Conference on Auto Collision Repair, or another national certification bodies. A good shop will be forthcoming with this information, so don&#8217;t hesitate to ask.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Can I Get an Estimate?</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To make sure that you&#8217;re getting the best deal for your auto body repairs, get three or four estimates from shops near you, and get these estimates in writing. You should also remember that the lowest estimate won&#8217;t necessarily translate into the best deal. As with most things in life, you get what you pay for when it comes to auto body repair. You want to find an affordable shop, but you also should be willing to pay a little extra for good work.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What </strong><strong>Vehicles Do You Normally Work On?</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not all auto body shops will be familiar with every vehicle make and model out there, so make sure that your shop of choice will be able to repair your vehicle before you agree to any work.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What Do Others Say About This Business?</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This isn&#8217;t necessarily something that you have to ask of an auto body shop, although most shops will be glad to answer the question, but what other people have to say about their work can tell you a lot about what you can expect. Ask your friends and family members if they have any experience with a particular shop, and look at online reviews for more information. You should take opinions that you read on the Internet with a grain of salt, but it will always be worth a look.</div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.1bao.org/questions-to-ask-an-auto-body-shop.html/\" target=\"_blank\">Questions to Ask an Auto Body Shop</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.1bao.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Automotive News and Tips</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Nov 2018 22:31:46 +0000","feedId":16697,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"28aa91d1ac7c388bfffab768d92c3ab9","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"admin","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602564617491}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 12:50:17","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 12:50:17","feedId":16697,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 04:50:17 +0000","fetchMs":50859,"handleMs":44712,"totalMs":96555,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3b815f166924abacecf011ee14a8b2ba","hostName":"us-003*","requestId":"ccfb4c1ad0e7495d9ddaa0cd96f8b2db_16697","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:13:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:13:25","id":16697,"name":"Automotive News and Tips","url":"http://www.1bao.org/?feed=rss2","subscriber":200,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.1bao.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"Blog Focus on Automotive News and Tips","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.1bao.org"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602564520937,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":51842,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":44713,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
