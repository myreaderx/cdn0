The defensible strategic location ensured that it would become a pivotal center for trade.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the 19th century, the city attracted Southern planters, who built mansions to show off their vast wealth from the cotton and sugarcane trade. Natchez was where planters came to escape the heat and isolation of the plantations. It was the Hamptons of the South — the place where the rich relaxed and socialized.</p>\n<p>I never heard of Natchez until a few weeks before I visited. While in Nashville, I met some local guys at a bar. Fascinated by <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/united-states-travel-costs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my road trip plans</a>, they gave me all the information they could on their home state of Mississippi. I mentioned my desire to see antebellum homes.</p>\n<p>“That’s Natchez. If you want antebellum homes, Natchez is the place to be,” they agreed.</p>\n<p>So I drove to Natchez, with its dozens of pre-Civil War antebellum homes. As a former history teacher who specialized in pre–Civil War America, I have a significant interest in this part of the country. I’m fascinated by the hypocrisy and duality of pre–Civil War Southern society.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, it was genteel, polite, and formal. On the other, it was brutally racist. Southern egalitarian views of chivalry, equality, and honor extended only to a small segment of society and they found no hypocrisy in owning slaves, whom they brutalized to no end. </p>\n<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: Reams of essays and books have delved into Southern culture.

Secession sentiment never ran high here and the city quickly surrendered to the Union Army in 1862. Therefore, none of the destruction that took place in other cities occurred here.</p>\n<p>Today, Natchez trades in tourism instead of cotton. Visitors to the historic homes, surrounding <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/natr/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Natchez Traces</a>, and gambling on the riverboats sustain this tiny town.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/natchez3.jpg\" alt=\"Huge home in Mississippi in the United States\" /></p>\n<p>But the old homes are the biggest draw.</p>\n<p>By today’s standards, they are average suburban homes. You wouldn’t stop and think “Wow, <em>that</em> is a mansion!” But for the period, these homes were an ornate testament to the planters’ great wealth, with high ceilings, intricate wallpaper designs, and multiple stories. They were filled with fine china, exotic carpets, and expensive furniture.</p>\n<p>There are over 20 homes here. I didn&#8217;t get to see them all, as many are private residencies. But I saw a lot &#8211; and the following are my favorite historic homes to visit in Natchez:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Longwood</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/natchez7.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior view of grand estate mansion in Natchez\" /><br />\nThis was one of the most interesting of all the homes. It had stunning grounds and an incredible design featuring a huge onion-shaped dome. It&#8217;s the largest octagonal house in the United States and entirely unique.</p>\n<p>Construction began in 1859, however, the owner died before most of the house was completed, leaving the entire upper floor unfinished (to this day, only a handful of the rooms are finished)</p>\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s one of Natchez&#8217;s most popular homes and you&#8217;re free to tour the home and read about its history. Be sure to wander the grounds, too. They&#8217;re beautiful! Admission is $25 USD.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Rosalie Mansion</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/rosaliemansion.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Elisa Rolle -https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rosalie_(Natchez,_Mississippi).JPG\"><br />\nI found this mansion to have the most beautiful interior of the handful of antebellum homes I visited. Built in 1823, its design was so popular that it inspired many other homeowners in the region to mimic its Greek Revival style.</p>\n<p>The mansion was built for a wealthy cotton broker. In 1863, after the Battle of Vicksburg, General Grant commandeered the home to use as his headquarters. General Gresham, who commanded Union troops in the region after Grant, continued to use the mansion as his headquarters for the duration of the war. There are all kinds of historic artifacts and furniture inside from the 19th century too.</p>\n<p>Today, the mansion is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and is an official U.S. National Historic Landmark. Admission is $20 USD.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stanton Hall</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/stantonhall.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Elisa Rolle -https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stanton_Hall.JPG\"><br />\nStanton Hall and its grounds take up an entire city block. It had the prettiest grounds of all the homes I visited too. Built in the 1850s (for the paltry sum of $83,000 USD), the home is a replica of the original owner&#8217;s former home in Ireland. Knicknamed Belfast, the interior is incredibly elaborate, featuring Italian marble and glass chandeliers. </p>\n<p>In 1890, the estate became home to Stanton College for Young Ladies. In 1940, it began its transition to a historic home and museum and is one the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as well as the U.S. National Historic Landmark list and the list of Mississippi Landmarks. Admission is $25 USD.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Melrose Mansion</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/melrosemansion.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Elisa Rolle -https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Melrose_(Natchez,_Mississippi),_13.JPG\"><br />\nBuilt in the 1840s, this 15,000-square-foot mansion represents the peak of Greek Revival design. Designed by a local lawyer and landowner, the original furniture of the home is still in use today, having been passed down through the centuries with each successive sale of the house. Most of the furniture dates to the pre-Civil War era.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, the mansion was used for elaborate parties and events before being turned into a museum and historic site. Like many of the antebellum homes here, it&#8217;s on both the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and the U.S. National Historic Landmark list. Admission is $10 USD.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Other Things to See and Do</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/natchez5.jpg\" alt=\"Bridge in Natchez at sunset with pink sky\" /><br />\nIn addition to the antebellum homes, there are a few other things to see and do in Natchez:</p>\n<p><strong>The Natchez Pilgrimage</strong><br />\nDuring <a href=\"http://www.natchezpilgrimage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Natchez Pilgrimage</a> in the spring, all of the private historical homes open up to the public. The costumed guides — some descendants of the original owners — explain the history of the home, their family, and the region. It’s the city’s biggest annual event and there are some 20 homes on display.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghost Tours</strong><br />\nIn a town with so much tumultuous history — including wars and oppressive slavery — it&#8217;s no wonder that there are all kinds of eerie and unsettling tales to be found in Natchez. If you&#8217;re a fan of the paranormal (or just want to do something unique), try taking a ghost tour. <a href=\"http://www.downtownkarlabrown.com/natchez-ghost-tour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Downtown Karla Brown</a> offers ghost tours a few evenings each week for $25 USD. You&#8217;ll hear all about Natchez&#8217;s haunting and spooky tales and get to see a side of the city most tourists miss.</p>\n<p><strong>Magnolia Bluffs Casino</strong><br />\nThis casino is located on the Mississippi River in the town&#8217;s old mill. The mill opened in 1828 and operated until 1962, eventually being bought and turned into a casino. It&#8217;s small and a bit outdated, but they have plenty of slot machines and a few table games, and the views over the river are picturesque. </p>\n<p><strong>St. Mary&#8217;s Basilica</strong><br />\nThis church was built in 1842 and took over forty years to complete. While the exterior is a little plain, the elaborate interior is beautiful, with colorful stained glass, statues, and a spacious vaulted ceiling. The original organ from 1882 is still in use as well. It&#8217;s on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>\n<p><strong>The Emerald Mound</strong><br />\nThis sacred hill just looks like a flat, grassy pentagon. However, it was once a well-appointed holy site. Constructed sometime between the 13th and 17th centuries, it was an elevated place of worship for the Plaquemine Native Americans. Ceremonial stone structures used to sit on top of the mound, which is 65 feet tall, though it is empty today. All kinds of animal bones have been found nearby, leading researchers to believe it was the site of religious or sacred activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Visit the King’s Tavern</strong><br />\nVisit the King’s Tavern, which was built in 1769 and is the oldest bar in the city (and, according to legend, the most haunted). After the Revolutionary War, it was used as an inn and tavern, as well as where the town&#8217;s mail was delivered. Until the development of the steamboat, the tavern relied on both coach drivers and outlaws who stopped by in between trips. When the invention of the steamboat made travel in the region safer, business dwindled and it was eventually sold. Today, it&#8217;s a farm-to-table restaurant.</p>\n<p>For a map of the area and suggested sites to include on your self-guided tour, <a href=\"https://www.visitnatchez.org/business/natchez-trails-and-walking-tour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check out this free tour from Visit Natchez</a>.</p>\n<p><center>***</center></p>\n<p>Natchez is beautiful and elegant. I loved strolling around the streets, marveling at the beautiful homes, stopping at King’s Tavern for wine while avoiding ghosts, and sitting in the park as the sunset over the Mississippi. It was the highlight of my trip to the state.  </p>\n<p>One downside to the city is that it’s expensive. There are very few Airbnb options and private rooms cost at least $95 USD per night. For a budget hotel, you&#8217;re looking at at least $60 USD per night. (Of course, if you want to splurge you can also stay in some of the historic homes here, as many have been converted into B&#038;Bs. You&#8217;re looking at at least $150 USD per night for those.)</p>\n<p>But, while accommodation is expensive, food and drinks are relatively cheap so you can balance it all out. </p>\n<p>Natchez may not be a budget travel destination, but if you are looking to learn about American history, see beautiful homes, and visit a destination off the beaten path for most travelers (visitors here tend to be from the surrounding region), visit Natchez. You won&#8217;t be disappointed. </p>\n<div class=\"single-booking\">\n<h4>Book Your Trip to Natchez: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>\n<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />\nFind a cheap flight by using <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3032045-12837948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skyscanner</a> or <a href=\"https://www.momondo.com/\">Momondo</a>.

While it often gets overshadowed by <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/seattle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seattle</a> to the north, Portland is one of the US&#8217;s best and most interesting metropolises. With a world-class food scene, plentiful local breweries, and postcard-perfect scenery, it&#8217;s surprising that more people don&#8217;t visit this eclectic place.</p>\n<p>Nicknamed &#8220;the City of Roses&#8221; (after roses became a common garden staple in the late 19th century) and &#8220;Stumptown&#8221; (due to lots of tree stumps remaining after the city expanded and clear-cut the surrounding area in the mid-19th century), Portland is known for its liberal tendencies, its food trucks, and its hipsters (thanks, <i>Portlandia</i>).</p>\n<p>My first trip here was back in 2011 for Thanksgiving. While in Spain I made friends who lived in Portland and paid them a visit on my way to Asia. What started as “like” during my first trip turned into love on my second. </p>\n<p>And, since then, I&#8217;ve visited nearly every year. Portland is on the very tiny list of cities I would actually live in.</p>\n<p>What I really love about Portland is the high quality of life. It’s compact and easy to get around, there is good public transportation available, the locals are friendly, it’s environmentally friendly, and, most importantly, the food and beer scene here is killer (so many food trucks).</p>\n<p>To help you make the most of your visit, here are my favorite 14 things to see and do in Portland:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>1. Take a Walking Tour</h3>\n<p>I always start my visits to a new city with a walking tour. It&#8217;s the best way to learn about a destination, get the lay of the land, see the main sights, and have an expert local guide answer all your questions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.portlandwalkingtours.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Portland Walking Tours</a> offers more than half a dozen different tours around town, focusing on food, the main sights, and Portland&#8217;s underground and alternative culture. Tours last a couple hours and cost around $23 USD. They&#8217;re a great way to kick off your visit. I really liked the Underground Tour especially, which focuses on a series of tunnels below the city that have been used for all kinds of nefarious purposes.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on a budget, <a href=\"https://www.secretsofportlandia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secrets of Portlandia</a> is a top-rated free walking tour that will give you a fun and informative intro to the City of Roses (they&#8217;re closed until 2021 due to COVID-19 though).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. See Pittock Mansion</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/portlandthings1.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The stately Pittock Mansion in Portland, Oregon on a summer day\"><br />\nBuilt in 1914, this is a stunning French Renaissance–style mansion located in the western part of town. The 46-room estate, originally owned by a wealthy couple from England, is part of the National Register of Historic Places and contains beautiful artwork and furniture collected by the original owners. You can explore the grounds (which span over 40 acres) and buildings by yourself or take a guided tour (the price is the same; however, guided tours are only scheduled when volunteers are available).</p>\n<p><em>3229 NW Pittock Dr, +1 503-823-3623, pittockmansion.org. Open daily 10am–4pm. Admission is $13 USD.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3. Hike Forest Park</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/portlandthings3.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The lush greenery of Forest Park in Portland, Oregon\"><br />\nForest Park is one of the nation&#8217;s largest urban parks. Covering a sprawling 5,000 acres, it&#8217;s home to over 70 miles of hiking and biking trails. There are over 100 species of birds here, as well as 62 different species of mammals. It&#8217;s also home to the Witch&#8217;s Castle, an abandoned stone building covered in moss. (It has no connection to witches. The name came from students who used to use the site for secret parties in the 1980s).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>4. Browse at Powell&#8217;s City of Books</h3>\n<p>This is the largest independent and used bookstore in the world, home to over a million books. Established in 1971, it has 3,500 different sections and buys over 3,000 new and used books each and every day. If you&#8217;re a book lover like me, you could easily spend a good chunk of time here. There&#8217;s also a café (World Cup Coffee and Tea House), so you can grab a coffee or tea and cozy up with your new purchases.</p>\n<p><em>1005 W Burnside St, +1 800-878-7323, powells.com/locations/powells-city-of-books. Open daily 9am–10pm.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>5. Devour Delicious Donuts</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/portlandthings2.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Tasty donuts from Voodoo Doughnut in Portland, Oregon\"><br />\nPortland is known for its donuts. If you Google the city or search for it on social media, donuts will inevitably pop up. Voodoo Doughnut put the city on the map with its weird and wonderful combinations, such as Cap&#8217;n Crunch or maple bacon. It also makes cream-filled phallic donuts as well — so you can see why it&#8217;s become a quirky staple of the city.</p>\n<p>Some locals might argue that Voodoo is for tourists, preferring donuts from Blue Star instead. You can&#8217;t go wrong with either choice. Why not try both and see for yourself. You only live once, after all!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>6. Wander the International Rose Test Garden</h3>\n<p>Home to over 10,000 rose bushes and 650 varieties, this garden is where many companies test new varieties of roses (some are tested here years before they are commercially available). It&#8217;s the oldest rose test garden in the country. It also hosts an annual competition for the city&#8217;s best rose. The roses are in bloom between April and October, though there is also an amphitheater here that holds all kinds of events, such as classical music performances and plays. Don&#8217;t miss the Shakespeare Garden, which only has types of roses referenced in Shakespeare&#8217;s plays.</p>\n<p><em>400 SW Kingston Ave, +1 503-823-3636. Open daily 5am–10pm. Admission is free.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>7. See the Japanese Garden</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/portlandthings4.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"A beautiful waterfall in the Japanese Garden in Portland, Oregon\"><br />\nLocated near the Rose Test Garden, these Japanese gardens were created in the 1960s as a symbol of peace between World War II adversaries. Today, it&#8217;s considered the best Japanese garden outside of Japan. Spanning 12 acres, it contains traditional gazebos, waterfalls, ponds, Zen sand gardens, and lots of walking paths. It&#8217;s super relaxing and serene and beautiful all year round, though it&#8217;s particularly stunning in the autumn when the leaves are changing. It receives no funding from the city, so it&#8217;s not cheap, but if you want to escape the city for a while, then it&#8217;s worth every penny.</p>\n<p><em>611 SW Kingston Ave, +1 503-223-1321, japanesegarden.org. Open daily 10am–7pm (12pm–7pm on Mondays). Admission is $18.95 USD</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>8. Visit The Freakybutture Peculiarium and Museum</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something decidedly weird and unconventional during your trip, visit The Peculiarium. This creepy emporium is full of all kinds of weird drawings and souvenirs, gag toys, unknown oddities in jars, and even a giant Bigfoot statue. There are fake severed body parts (which are super lifelike), and they also serve fresh-baked cookies&#8230;with bugs, scorpions, and mealworms inside and on them.</p>\n<p>The city&#8217;s slogan is &#8220;Keep Portland Weird.&#8221; This place reflects that perfectly.</p>\n<p><em>2234 Northwest Thurman Street, +1 503-227-3164, peculiarium.com. Open Tuesday–Sunday 11am–7pm. Admission is $5 USD. Not suitable for kids.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>9. Take a Food Tour</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a foodie like me, you can&#8217;t visit Portland without taking a food tour. You&#8217;ll get to sample some of the city&#8217;s best food, learn about its culture and history, and meet other foodie travelers like yourself. It&#8217;s the best way to get the culinary lay of the land before you head off on your own to eat your way around town.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forktown.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forktown</a> offers a few different food tours focused on different cuisines and regions of the city. It will give you a solid overview of what tasty offerings Stumptown can dish up.</p>\n<p><em>Tours last around three hours and cost $89 USD per person.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>10. Relax at Laurelhurst Park or Washington Park</h3>\n<p>Portland has tons of green space to relax in and enjoy. Laurelhurst Park was designed by the same team that designed Central Park in <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/new-york-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York</a>. It has a laid-back atmosphere and is popular with locals and visitors alike. There&#8217;s a duck pond, bike paths, and the off-leash dog area.</p>\n<p>Washington Park is another great choice if you&#8217;re looking to lounge with a book and enjoy the weather. The park contains memorials for the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the Holocaust, and the Lewis and Clark expedition, and also offers beautiful vistas of Portland and Mt. Hood.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>11. Indulge at the Food Trucks</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/portlandthings5.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"A line of food trucks and street food stalls in Portland, Oregon\"><br />\nOne of the most important elements of the Portland food scene is its food trucks. The food trucks are a huge part of the local culture, and you can find pretty much every cuisine and every price point too. There are over 600 food trucks in the city, and they&#8217;re usually gathered in small pods so you can sample a few different ones without having to go far. </p>\n<p>You can find plenty of tasty options on Fifth Ave, Third Ave, and at the food pods (food truck lots) at Cartopia and Hawthorne Asylum. Some of my favorites are MF Tasty, Burger Stevens, Hapa PDX Ramen, and  Desi PDX.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>12. Visit the Portland Art Museum</h3>\n<p>Opened in 1892, this is the oldest art museum in the Pacific Northwest. It&#8217;s also one of the oldest galleries in the country too (the seventh oldest to be exact). It&#8217;s home to over 42,000 items, from contemporary art to Native American works to Asian art and everything in between. There are permanent exhibitions, rotating temporary galleries, and an outdoor sculpture park. There&#8217;s a lot of variety here, so be sure to check the website to see what&#8217;s on during your visit.</p>\n<p><em>1219 SW Park Ave, +1 503-226-2811, portlandartmuseum.org. Open Tuesday–Sunday 10am–5pm (8pm on Thursdays and Fridays). Admission is $20 USD and free on the first Thursday of the month from 5pm to 8pm.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>13. Drink Some Beer</h3>\n<p>Portland is one of the beer capitals of America. There are over 75 microbreweries in the city — more than any other city on earth — and Portlandians take their beer seriously. The craft beer movement started here back in the &#8217;80s, well before it caught on elsewhere. Many breweries have their own tours, as well as their own restaurants, so you can enjoy a pint and a bite to eat. Many offer tours, and there are also multi-brewery tours from companies like <a href=\"https://www.citybrewtours.com/portland/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City Brew Tours</a>. If you&#8217;re a craft beer aficionado, be sure to indulge (responsibly).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>14. Hike the Columbia River Gorge</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/portlandthings6.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"A scenic vista overlooking the Columbia River Gorge near Portland, Oregon\"><br />\nIf you&#8217;re looking to get out of the city and stretch your legs, head to the Columbia River Gorge. Located east of the city, it is home to waterfalls, scenic vistas, and hiking trails. It&#8217;s the largest National Scenic Area in the country and makes for a nice place to spend a day. Oregon&#8217;s tallest waterfall, Multnomah Falls, can be found here, as well as a hundred-year old observatory that offers up views of the surrounding picturesque landscape.</p>\n<p>Some suggested hikes are Dry Creek Falls (easy, 2 hours), Wahkenna Falls Loop (moderate, 3 hours), and Starvation Ridge and Warren Lake (hard, 8 hours). You can reach the gorge with a vehicle in around 30 minutes, but there&#8217;s also a daily shuttle for $20 USD (round trip) in case you don&#8217;t have a car.</p>\n<p><center>***</center></p>\n<p>Portland is one of my favorite American cities. It&#8217;s fun, eclectic, and energetic, and it has a lot to offer (especially if you&#8217;re a foodie or craft beer lover). It deserves far more attention than it gets — from domestic and international travelers alike. If you find yourself in the PNW, be sure to spend a few days here. Your tastebuds will thank you!</p>\n<div class=\"single-booking\">\n<h4>Book Your Trip to Portland: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>\n<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />\nFind a cheap flight by using <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3032045-12837948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skyscanner</a> or <a href=\"https://www.momondo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Momondo</a>.
