A large number of <em>Australopithecus</em> and early <em>Homo</em> skeletons track the transition to bipedal walking and the appearance of features that mark our present anatomy. But it's much harder to figure out what led to the mental capabilities—complex language, the near-constant use of tools, and so on—that help set humans apart.</p>\n<p>Much harder—but not entirely impossible. Remains of skulls can help us figure out the likely cranial capacity of extinct species. And the brain actually leaves its mark on the interior of skulls, allowing some aspects of the brain's anatomy to be pieced together. Now, an international team has done this sort of analysis on a set of <em>Homo erectus</em> from a critical point in our species' past. They have found that some earlier brain species persisted well into the history of our genus <em>Homo</em>, but that didn't stop those ancestors from migrating out of Africa.</p>\n<h2>Reconstructing brains</h2>\n<p>How do you figure out what a brain once looked like? You need a reasonably intact skull, which is relatively rare, given the fragility of the bones. Once the skull is reconstructed, it's possible to make what's called an \"endocast\" of the interior of the skull, capturing the details of its features, including where it conformed to the underlying brain. In some cases, endocasts form naturally during the deposition of material around a fossil. They could also be made after discovery and now can be done virtually thanks to our ability to scan and reconstruct 3D volumes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755803#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755803&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=o6RrRED8hH0:rdODMgq3S84:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=o6RrRED8hH0:rdODMgq3S84:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=o6RrRED8hH0:rdODMgq3S84:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=o6RrRED8hH0:rdODMgq3S84:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=o6RrRED8hH0:rdODMgq3S84:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=o6RrRED8hH0:rdODMgq3S84:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 17:07:53 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Skull_in_dmanisi_archaeological_site-800x600.jpg","linkMd5":"86583cd778e3622b040b031177a9c2f4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn10@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-24-491_be4ce2adbbf5fcc0.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":121947,"destBytes":51472,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Skull_in_dmanisi_archaeological_site-800x600.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn10@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-24-491_be4ce2adbbf5fcc0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=o6RrRED8hH0:rdODMgq3S84:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn36@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-59-985_a5fff788a4c8cbe0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=o6RrRED8hH0:rdODMgq3S84:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn48@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-00-008_f67380b8aacec284.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-59-947_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn43@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-00-133_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026320681},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:20","title":"The big advance in Elon Musk’s Pong-playing monkey is what you can’t see","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755945","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-09-at-3.48.29-PM-800x553.png\" alt=\"The big advance in Elon Musk’s Pong-playing monkey is what you can’t see\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-09-at-3.48.29-PM.png\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1127\" data-width=\"1629\">Enlarge</a> </p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>On Thursday, one of Elon Musk's companies, Neuralink, <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/blog/\">posted a video</a> showing a monkey playing Pong using nothing but a brain implant connected wirelessly with the computer hosting the game. While it's a fantastic display of the technology, most of the individual pieces of this feat have been done before—in some cases, over a decade before. But Neuralink has managed to take two important steps: miniaturizing the device and getting it to communicate wirelessly.</p>\n<h2>What has been done</h2>\n<p>Neuralink's goal is to develop easy-to-implant, compact, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/elon-musks-neuralink-both-an-evolution-and-a-plan-for-radical-change/\">wireless brain implants</a>. Initially, these devices will be used for obvious goals, like re-establishing some degree of independence in paralyzed individuals. But Musk has made it very clear he sees the longer term goal as making the implants commonplace and able to do far more mundane things, like providing direct, brain-driven control of electronic devices.</p>\n<p>For now, however, the early goals are dominating progress. About a year and a half ago, Neuralink showed off hardware implanted in pigs, with the implants providing real-time data about the goings-on within the pigs' brains' sensory regions as the animals explored their surroundings.
