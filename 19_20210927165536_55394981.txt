Now would be a good time to tell them to stop.</p>\n<p>Early in 2010 Amazon responded to the imminent launch of iBooks by offering new payment terms to indie authors. Self-published books had been in the Kindle Store since it launched in November 2007, but most of those came by way of the Amazon subsidiary Mobipocket and paid a 35% royalty.</p>\n<p>Now anyone who dealt directly with Amazon could earn a 70% royalty on the sale of their ebook, with one caveat.</p>\n<p>You could get the 70% royalty minus a delivery fee. Amazon sold ebooks on 3G-equipped Kindles at that point, and unlike regular internet service, 3G bandwidth had a discrete cost which Amazon wanted to recoup. (Similarly, this is why Amazon charged to deliver personal documents to your Kindle over 3G but not over Wifi.)</p>\n<p>That delivery fee has made less and less sense over the years as sales of 3G-eqipped Kindles dropped, but Amazon was able to keep the fee so long as they still sold said Kindles. But now that is going to have to change.</p>\n<p>News broke <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet\">last month</a> that Amazon is going to be shutting off 3G service starting in December. This means that owners of 12 year old Kindle DX and Kindle 2 ereaders are finally going to have to upgrade their devices, but it also means that Amazon will no longer have an excuse to charge for delivery of ebooks.</p>\n<p>That delivery fee was always about the cost of 3G service (the charges for personal document delivery makes that indisputable), and now that service is going away.</p>\n<p>The fee needs to go with it, but that isn&#8217;t going to happen until the book publishing industry demands it. Amazon will charge that fee so long as we let them get away with it. Authors, publishers, and trade groups such as the IBPA need to start challenging Amazon on this issue.</p>\n<p>It is only through collective pressure that we can make Amazon  change its policy.</p>\n<p>Who is with me?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">image by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bryanalexander/\">BryanAlexander</a> via <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bryanalexander/3155607809/\">Flickr</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com/blog/amazon-is-about-to-shut-down-their-excuse-for-charging-kindle-ebook-delivery-fees/\">Amazon is About to Shut Down Their Excuse for Charging Kindle eBook Delivery Fees</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com\">Nate Hoffelder</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=8pUXowwoE4g:2iTjoqoaFw8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=8pUXowwoE4g:2iTjoqoaFw8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=8pUXowwoE4g:2iTjoqoaFw8:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/8pUXowwoE4g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 14:04:36 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3155607809_a7f74aebca_h.jpg?fit=768%2C415&ssl=1","linkMd5":"a53a8fa61193c652ee221ed4c75faa2d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-10-691_f68aa7ec7e486697.webp","destWidth":768,"destHeight":415,"sourceBytes":22644,"destBytes":22644,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3155607809_a7f74aebca_h.jpg?fit=768%2C415&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-10-691_f68aa7ec7e486697.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-29-725_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-29-543_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn33@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-29-487_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/8pUXowwoE4g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-32-969_67ff7bd26a3dfc5c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709666},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"Morning Coffee – 12 September 2021","link":"https://natehoffelder.com/?p=209703","description":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?fit=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?w=1920&#38;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=610%2C343&#38;ssl=1 610w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=1080%2C608&#38;ssl=1 1080w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=980%2C551&#38;ssl=1 980w, https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?resize=480%2C270&#38;ssl=1 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><p>Here are a few stories to read this Monday morning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-offset-key=\"2ojrd-0-0\">Amazon has announced several software updates <a href=\"https://buff.ly/394CXhz\">coming to the Kindle</a>. </span></li>\n<li><span data-offset-key=\"2ojrd-0-0\">Librarians are talking about <a href=\"https://buff.ly/3lm0yjx\">replacing the Dewey System</a>.

One of my concerns was that scammers, hackers, or other criminal types might misuse your old domain.</p>\n<p>A couple days ago I found the perfect example of how that can happen, and why you need to be careful.</p>\n<p>To make a long story short, someone has re-registered the old domain for the defunct ebook company Vook, and they are fraudulently pretending that Vook is alive and well.</p>\n<p>I discovered this a couple days ago when an old acquaintance reached out. We hadn&#8217;t spoken in years, not since before he left Vook. While we were chatting, I happened to look up Vook&#8217;s website, just to see where it went. Vook had <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2015/05/19/vook-finalizes-pivot-from-creator-to-distributorservices-rebrands-as-pronoun/\">changed its name to Pronoun</a> in 2015 and was <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2016/05/25/macmillan-acquires-self-pub-distributor-pronoun/\">acquired by Macmillan</a> in 2016, so I was curious to see how Macmillan was using the domain.</p>\n<p>Much to my surprise, Vook.com appeared to have been revived as an ebook services company, and my friend had resumed his role as one of the managers. This was an even bigger surprise to him given that he had moved on to other endeavors years ago.</p>\n<p>Someone has apparently loaded an 8-year-old copy of the Vook website onto a French server, and is pretending that the company is alive and well. And given that they are fraudulently claiming my friend is still involved, I have serious concerns that they are up to no good.</p>\n<p>Old brands are revived all the time, it is true. The defunct retailer Circuit City is alive again, and the ebook retail pioneer Fictionwise.com was back in operation for a few years (the domain now belongs to a Polish Viagra blog).</p>\n<p>Yes, brands come back under new owners, but one key difference with the Vook situation is that whoever owns it is lying to visitors. This is an ebook services company which wants you to give them money, and they are lying to us about who is in charge and where the company has its offices while at the same time making it difficult to identify the actual owner.</p>\n<p>I do not know that this is necessarily nefarious, but it raises red flags and I had to warn you.</p>\n<p>Beware resurrected tech companies; you don&#8217;t always know who raised the zombie, or why.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com/blog/beware-resurrected-tech-companies/\">Beware Resurrected Tech Companies</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com\">Nate Hoffelder</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=vkMVdpImRIE:wAdZIJhzEfo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=vkMVdpImRIE:wAdZIJhzEfo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=vkMVdpImRIE:wAdZIJhzEfo:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/vkMVdpImRIE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 23:43:07 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Beware-Resurrected-Tech-Companies.jpg?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1","linkMd5":"9ca7c828b5c37c4cd7352ecbfb6fb3a6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn4@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-10-137_5d7f909fe9fd0526.webp","destWidth":768,"destHeight":432,"sourceBytes":61358,"destBytes":61358,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Beware-Resurrected-Tech-Companies.jpg?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn4@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-10-137_5d7f909fe9fd0526.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-29-725_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-29-543_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn33@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-29-487_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/vkMVdpImRIE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn72@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-29-600_9573139bebf908b7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709666},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"Monday Morning Coffee – 27 September 2021","link":"https://natehoffelder.com/?p=210063","description":"<img width=\"768\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/natehoffelder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/coffee.jpg?fit=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block;

screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/prk1kq/is_there_gonna_be_a_new_kindle_theres_a_new/\">Reddit users</a> have discovered that Amazon&#8217;s sites in Mexico and elsewhere are now showing references to a new Paperwhite Signature edition. According to the leaked specs, the device sports a flush-mounted 6.8&#8243; E-ink screen. I don&#8217;t have the actual resolution yet, but we do know it has 300 PPI, and according to the leak it will ship with either 8GB or 32GB storage.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s twice or more the storage of the 6&#8243; Paperwhite, and the new device will also have more LEDs in the frontlight (17 LEDS vs 4). Those extra LEDs are there to give the screen a color-changing frontlight like the one found on competing ereaders and the Kindle Oasis.</p>\n<p>The new model will also feature wireless charging, and are rated as meeting the IPX8 waterproofing standard. US and international prices are currently unknown, but the Canadian prices suggest that this model will cost $45 CAD and $105 CAD more than the 6&#8243; paperwhite.</p>\n<p>When I first heard about this leak, I assumed that Amazon would announce the new Kindle tomorrow (Amazon likes to launch hardware on Tuesdays). But we also know that Amazon has a big hardware event <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684357/amazon-fall-event-devices-services-features-september-28th-echo-alexa\">scheduled for next Tuesday</a>, and there&#8217;s a good chance that Amazon will be announcing the new Kindle Paperwhite then.</p>\n<p>It has been some three years since Amazon last released a new Paperwhite, and two years since they released the Oasis. It has been so long since the last launch that one could honestly have expected Amazon to retire the hardware entirely. Or at least that was the case until last week. The release of a new Kindle firmware hinted at the idea that we could see a new Kindle launch sooner or later, and I can now report that it will be the former.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://natehoffelder.com/blog/the-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-will-sport-a-6-8-screen/\">The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Will Sport a 6.8&#8243;
