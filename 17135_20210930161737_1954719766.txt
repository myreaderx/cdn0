People are shopping across Google more than a billion times a day, and we have been working to make those experiences even more helpful by expanding your options. We’re here to help you find new ideas, discover unique products or get the best value from the widest possible range of merchants — from large retailers, marketplaces and well-known brands, to local stores and new direct-to-consumer companies.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>We’ve made a number of changes over the last couple of years to improve your shopping experience, including giving you more choice when you shop on Google. For example, we’ve <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/its-now-free-to-sell-on-google/\">made it free</a> for merchants to list on Google and <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/more-ways-to-shop/\">made it easy</a> for sellers on Shopify and other digital platforms to&nbsp; start selling on Google, so their products and inventory are discoverable for shoppers.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>And today, we’re adding new tools to make it easier for shoppers to browse for inspiration, find new products and brands and ultimately find what they’re looking for in a more visual way.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Shop in the moment with Google Lens&nbsp;</h3>\n  <p>We know that inspiration can strike at any time. Whether it’s an image that you see online, a photo you saved on your phone or something in the real world that catches your eye, Google Lens makes the products you see instantly shoppable.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Starting soon, iOS users will see a new button in the Google app to make all the images on a page searchable through Google Lens. Now, finding this lamp or that shirt (and ones like it) is just a tap away.</p>\n  <p>We’re also bringing Lens to Chrome on your desktop. Soon, you will be able to select images, video and text content on a website with Lens to quickly see search results in the same tab — without leaving the page you’re on.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\" article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 \">\n   <img alt=\"Looking at ApartmentTherapy.com from the Google app for iOS, tap the “search images” button at the bottom in order to see information about the products on the screen, as well as similar products.\" class=\"article-image--large\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Search_On_Lens_Mode.gif\" tabindex=\"0\" />\n  </div>\n  <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n   <div class=\"rich-text\">\n    <p>Shop in the moment with Lens in the Google app for iOS</p>\n   </div>\n  </figcaption>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Window shop right from Search&nbsp;</h3>\n  <p>Starting today, we’re making it easier to browse for clothing, shoes and accessories on mobile right from your Search results. For example, when you search for “cropped jackets,” we’ll show you a visual feed of jackets in various colors and styles, alongside other helpful information like local shops, style guides and videos. From there, you can easily filter your search by style, department, brand and more – and when you find something you like, you can check out ratings, reviews and even compare prices to get the best deal.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>This new experience is powered by Google’s Shopping Graph, a comprehensive, real-time dataset of products, inventory, and merchants with more than 24 billion listings. This not only helps us connect shoppers with the right products for them, it also helps millions of merchants and brands get discovered on Google every day.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\" article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n   <img alt=\"A search for “cropped jackets” shows a visual, scrollable results page with products and helpful information like styling guides\" class=\"article-image--medium\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/E918_Search_On_storyboards_Browsy_Shopping_nl_1.gif\" tabindex=\"0\" />\n  </div>\n  <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n   <div class=\"rich-text\">\n    <p>Browse and explore options for cropped jackets on mobile right from Search</p>\n   </div>\n  </figcaption>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Search in-store inventory from home</h3>\n  <p>Shoppers are increasingly starting their in-person shopping experience online.
