About 1,000 creators, including a number of short-film makers, teachers and consultants, have already joined the platform, said Madhavan, who co-founded the startup, formerly known as Socionity, in January this year. Prior to CreatorOS, he worked at a number of firms, including Microsoft.</p>\n<p>“We believe that these creators will become an entrepreneur in the coming decade. So we are creating tools, connections and infrastructure that they will need to run their digital businesses. Currently, there is a lot of spray and pray happening on the creator&#8217;s part. They are producing videos in hopes that they go viral so more people in the industry discover them,” said Madhavan in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The marquee tool on CreatorOS today is an app-builder that allows creators to build their own apps, push and sell their content in it and build their own communities. Madhavan said CreatorOS has overly reduced the efforts that need to go into building an app to simply drag and drop.</p>\n<p>The startup said today it has also raised $500,000 from a clutch of high-profile names. Some of the angel investors include Phanindra Sama (founder and former chief executive of online ticket booking platform RedBus.in), Gaurav Munjal (co-founder and chief executive of online learning platform <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/unacademy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"unacademy\">Unacademy), <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Kalyan Krishnamurthy (chief executive of Flipkart Group), Sujeet Kumar (co-founder of business-to-business marketplace <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/udaan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"udaan\">Udaan), <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Vidit Aatrey (co-founder and chief executive of social e-commerce Meesho), Vivekananda Hallekere (co-founder and chief executive of mobility firm Bounce) and Alvin Tse (GM of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/xiaomi\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"xiaomi\">Xiaomi <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Indonesia).</p>\n<p>Madhavan said that the trust that so many established entrepreneurs showed in CreatorOS convinced him that he did not need to engage with VC firms yet and instead put the entire focus on serving creators. He said the ban on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/tiktoks-rivals-in-india-struggle-to-cash-in-on-its-ban/\">so many startups are trying to scale their short-video apps</a> has created an immense opportunity for CreatorOS.</p>\n<p>The startup expects to have more than 5,000 creators on its platform by the end of the year. It is working with creators to understand and build more features that would benefit them, said Madhavan.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gVZveHdE1T\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/tiktoks-rivals-in-india-struggle-to-cash-in-on-its-ban/\">TikTok&#8217;s rivals in India struggle to cash in on its ban</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;TikTok&#8217;s rivals in India struggle to cash in on its ban&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/tiktoks-rivals-in-india-struggle-to-cash-in-on-its-ban/embed/#?secret=gVZveHdE1T\" data-secret=\"gVZveHdE1T\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/5OcwFLFmgCc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 12:01:02 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"1cd7be356ec289078db742837f7c985a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-11-46-714_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-11-46-714_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-10-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-09-192_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn52@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-12-10-055_e6a496875da409fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=5OcwFLFmgCc:j36hDW5Forg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-09-144_b6a3ba42b04d78d3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn76@2020_1/2020/10/09/19-12-10-365_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/5OcwFLFmgCc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_1/2020/10/09/19-12-09-241_6a745ad3f9e510ae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602270697607},{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:37","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:37","title":"Devialet announces wireless earbuds","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2058326","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">High-end speaker manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.devialet.com\">Devialet</a> is launching its first pair of earbuds.

live-stream","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2058659","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/mojiit\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mojiit\">Mojiit, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> the Los Angeles-based company behind the popular avatar generation service Mojichat, has landed one of its highest-profile users with the launch of Odell Beckham Jr.&#8217;s live stream over the weekend.</p>\n<p>As Odell Beckham Jr. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp-EHfEadFE\">did his first live stream with the gaming superstar Dr. Disrespect</a>, he turned to Mojichat to create the pop-up onscreen emote that danced above a logo from <a href=\"https://scufgaming.com/\">Scuf Gaming</a>, a retailer of customized controllers.</p>\n<p>Customized, branded emotes are one of the ways that companies are trying to make it easier for live-streamers to make money off of their shows. Companies like Mochjichat argue that it&#8217;s a more elegant solution for gamers to use, because it doesn&#8217;t take viewers away from the live stream, where they could potentially miss some of the action.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wp-EHfEadFE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>Typically, streamers rely on advertising revenue from pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll advertising, according to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/mojichat\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mojichat\">Mojichat <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> co-founder Jeremy Greene. Alongside his wife, Janelle, Greene built Mojichat into one of the premier names in avatar development. As competitors crowded in, the company has been diversifying its products to allow for influencers to begin using their digital avatars as a monetization source.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;No streamer… wants to run a pre-roll,&#8221; said Greene. &#8220;The first thing about Mojichat that made us very successful from the very beginning, you have to hunt down someone to make your custom emotes for you.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the company partnered with DoorDash on a similar activation for a concert to raise money for the Boys and Girls Club as part of a broad celebrity effort to raise money to alleviate food insecurity for families affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Any time someone sends a communication, that will trigger an alert that floats as a Mojichat animation on top of the screen,&#8221; Greene said of the earlier activation. </span></p>\n<p>The way that Greene describes the service &#8212; and Janelle and his larger vision for the company &#8212; is to be the next generation of adserver for the live-streaming market.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;My plan is to become the avatar solution for all of Unity,&#8221; Greene told me earlier. &#8220;We will offer up our platform to every single gaming platform or mobile developer to plug and play&#8230; I would consider us… we’re like the Google Admob for live stream.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Companies like <a href=\"https://streamlabs.com/\">Streamlabs</a> are integrating Mojichat&#8217;s features into their streaming offerings. and the work with Dr. Disrespect and Odell Beckham Jr. show just how much demand there is for these types of offerings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The avatar space is going to be won in the gaming community,&#8221; Greene said.</p>\n<p>Mojichat already has 12,000 streamers using the technology right now, and through a partnership inked earlier this year the company expects to push more ads through the service.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Nobody wants to sit on a stream for 15 hours a day,&#8221; said Greene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;It’s really wrong that streamers can’t make as much money as YouTubers… a streamer can spend all day on Twitch and they are forced to run these pre-rolls… [meanwhile] Jake Paul can upload a video to YouTube and make $300,000&#8230; T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hat’s really why I built Mojichat&#8230; I wanted to make gamers’ lives easier… We are going to build custom software for gamers that makes their lives easier.&#8221;</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CFoLv4hmy2Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 16:34:11 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"e674116b37ba7b3c6ef553087762654c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-11-46-714_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-11-46-714_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-10-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-09-192_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-12-09-304_07c0ccc493de4ad1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CFoLv4hmy2Y:sUpXQnKLVaA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn56@2020_1/2020/10/09/19-12-09-335_9d87424362880831.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn76@2020_1/2020/10/09/19-12-10-365_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CFoLv4hmy2Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn38@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-12-09-099_d70b24309e8eac90.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602270697592},{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:37","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:37","title":"These tiny sensors can hitch a ride on mothback","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2058476","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Everyone is familiar with carrier pigeons, but what about carrier moths? <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/10/08/airdropping-sensors-from-moths/\">This research project</a> uses the nocturnal insects as a delivery service for tiny electronic packages that weigh less than a hundredth of an ounce.</p>\n<p>The system was created by graduate students at the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/university-of-washington\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"university-of-washington\">University of Washington <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and its prolific tiny gadget creator Shyam Gollakota.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IYvl9V6r8h\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/bumble-bees-bearing-high-tech-backpacks-act-as-a-living-data-collection-platform/\">Bumblebees bearing high-tech backpacks act as a living data collection platform</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Bumblebees bearing high-tech backpacks act as a living data collection platform&#8221;

To keep things lightweight and simple, the little sensor is held on with a tiny magnetic pin. A wireless signal can be sent that creates a current in a coil surrounding the pin, affecting its magnetic field and dropping the gadget.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s small enough to be carried quiet easily by a moth — though it must be noted that the hawk moth isn&#8217;t exactly the smallest moth of all time; they get up to hummingbird size, as I&#8217;ve experienced myself. But it looks as if the tiny device would fit easily on a smaller species as well. Maybe that&#8217;s the next experiment.</p>\n<p>Cheap, long-lasting sensors carried to every corner of an ecosystem by moths (or other insects) could produce very interesting data for those who study those ecosystems.

Last month, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/\">announced</a> that it would roll out a test feature prompting users to click through a link before retweeting it to the platform at large.

The company does plan to remove any tweets &#8220;meant to incite interference with the election process or with the implementation of election results&#8221; including ones that incite violence.</p>\n<p>Next week, Twitter will also implement new restrictions on misleading tweets it labels, showing users a pop-up prompt linking to credible information when they go to view the tweet. Twitter applies these labels to tweets that spread misinformation about COVID-19, elections and voting, and anything that contains manipulated media, like deepfakes or otherwise misleading edited videos.</p>\n<p>The company will also take additional measures against misleading tweets that get a label when they&#8217;re from a U.S. political figure, candidate or campaign. To see a tweet with one of its labels, a user will have to tap through a warning. Labeled tweets will have likes, normal retweets and replies disabled.</p>\n<p>These new measures will also apply to labeled tweets from anyone with more than 100,000 followers or tweets that are getting viral traction. &#8220;We expect this will further reduce the visibility of misleading information, and will encourage people to reconsider if they want to amplify these Tweets,&#8221; Twitter said in its announcement.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2058795\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2058795\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2058795\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Twitter warning on labeled tweet\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg 2835w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/label-warning.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2058795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Twitter</p></div></p>\n<p>Twitter will also turn off recommendations in the timeline in an effort to &#8220;slow down&#8221; how fast tweets can reach people from accounts they don&#8217;t follow.

The SPAC market is also on the verge of overheating, based on what she is seeing. &#8220;You have 10 deals trying to price in the same day, and investors are tapped out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And SPACs require a learning curve that some underestimate. &#8220;It&#8217;s why you see hedge funds and PE firms more involved in SPACs; they have infrastructure to do them versus three guys who are facing a ton of work just to do the administrative side of things,&#8221; notes Marvin.</p>\n<p>As with other financial products, Marvin expects to see more women embrace SPACs over time, especially if they prove to be as durable as many early adherents suggest. That said, she adds, &#8220;If in a year or two, it&#8217;s still only male VCs who&#8217;ve dipped their toe into SPACs, it may be a problem.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Qj3ZTD_hoFk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 23:46:47 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"f0d6cb4d694e625584a12c2f513c38e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-11-46-714_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Connie Loizos","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-11-46-714_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-10-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-09-192_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn84@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-09-297_1a4265fa8755b6bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Qj3ZTD_hoFk:H0sQb-T4MZE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_1/2020/10/09/19-12-09-204_23ae914b3fa4d717.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn76@2020_1/2020/10/09/19-12-10-365_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Qj3ZTD_hoFk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_6/2020/10/09/19-12-10-016_911ff0aaaffd0be6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602270697607},{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:37","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:37","title":"Militia tied to plot to kidnap Gov.

Just this week, Facebook announced both a broader ban on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/\">pro-Trump conspiracy known as QAnon</a> and a new policy for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/facebook-poll-watching-trump-election-political-ads/\">voter intimidation efforts</a> that use militaristic language.</p>\n<p>When asked if the terror plot had an impact on the company&#8217;s recent spate of surprising policy changes, Facebook did not provide a direct response. It&#8217;s also not clear if the domestic terror plot used Facebook groups to recruit and connect online or just to communicate among members who already knew each other in real life.</p>\n<p>Researchers who study extremism have long expressed concerns that Facebook&#8217;s algorithmic recommendations can push users toward dangerous ideas — and dangerous behavior.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NTb75g00Jo\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/\">Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook says it will ban QAnon across its platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/embed/#?secret=NTb75g00Jo\" data-secret=\"NTb75g00Jo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Militias and other kinds of domestic extremist groups have increasingly leaned on Facebook for recruitment in recent years. Once members are connected and vetted, often through public groups, they are allowed into an inner circle, sometimes in the form of a private Facebook group. The Proud Boys, a violent far-right group with ties to white supremacists, were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/proud-boys-facebook-mcinnes/\">a prominent example</a> of this recruitment strategy.</p>\n<p>Users can be ushered into these extremist groups by Facebook&#8217;s algorithmic suggestions, which previously appeared in a box next to a group&#8217;s activity. For Facebook pages, those suggestions still appear to the side of the main stream of content, directing users toward &#8220;related pages.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/facebook-proud-boys-mcinnes-kicked-off/\">banned the Proud Boys</a> from its platform in late 2018. But groups interested in violence that kept a lower profile have maintained a large presence on the platform well into 2020, including a number of <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/patriot-movement\">state &#8220;patriot&#8221; organizations</a> and anti-government <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/8/21276911/boogaloo-explained-civil-war-protests\">boogaloo groups</a> that coordinate firearm and combat trainings through the platform.</p>\n<p>In June, Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-boogaloo-ban/\">banned a &#8220;violent network&#8221; of boogaloo groups</a>, but other groups remain, organizing under code words related to the boogaloo movement. One boogaloo page TechCrunch identified calling itself &#8220;definitely not boogaloo&#8221; was selling &#8220;Boogaloo Boys&#8221; patches and posting violent memes as recently as this week.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for researchers and reporters tracking this kind of activity, Facebook recently removed the option to see how many members are in a public group at a glance from the search page.</p>\n<p>Facebook recently announced a plan to actually <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-groups-to-gain-suite-of-new-tools-for-managing-discussions-surfacing-public-content/\">expand the reach of its public groups</a>, surfacing them to more users. &#8220;Public Group posts may now get more distribution on and off Facebook so that more people can discover and join in on the conversation,&#8221;

From <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/register-to-vote-twitter-facebook-snapchat/\">Snapchat</a> to <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/why-credit-karma-voter-registration\">Credit Karma</a>, it&#8217;s hard to open an app without being reminded to register — and that&#8217;s a good thing. Snapchat says it <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/snapchat-400000-people-registered-vote-ae9064a1-72c0-4eef-924d-d1e0d7bc95f2.html?utm_source=twitter&#38;utm_medium=social&#38;utm_campaign=organic&#38;utm_content=1100\">registered around 400,000 new voters</a> through its own reminders and Facebook estimates that it helped <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21446116/facebook-more-people-register-vote-2020-2016\">2.5 million people</a> register to vote this year.</p>\n<p>Voting rights advocates are concerned that 2020&#8217;s rapid scale-up of vote-by-mail might lead to many ballots being thrown out — a worry foreshadowed by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rejected-mail-ballots/2020/08/23/397fbe92-db3d-11ea-809e-b8be57ba616e_story.html\">half a million ballots</a> that were tossed out in state primaries. Some of those ballots failed to meet deadlines or were deemed invalid due to other mistakes voters made when filling them out.</p>\n<p>In Florida, voters that were young, non-white or voting for the first time were <a href=\"https://www.aclufl.org/en/aclu-florida-report-vote-mail-ballots-2018-general-election\">twice as likely</a> to have their ballots thrown out compared to white voters in the 2018 election, according to research by the ACLU.</p>\n<p>Adding to concerns, state rules vary and they can be specific and confusing for voters new to voting through the mail. In Pennsylvania, the most likely state to decide the results of the 2020 election, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/10/01/918368319/naked-ballot-rule-could-lead-to-thousands-of-pa-votes-getting-rejected\">new rules against &#8220;naked ballots&#8221;</a> mean that any ballot not cast in an additional secrecy sleeve will be tossed out.

This week, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/\">expanded its ban on QAnon</a>, the elaborate web of outlandish pro-Trump conspiracies that have increasingly <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/qanon-violence-crime-conspiracy-theory-us-allegation-arrest-killing-gun-2020-8\">spilled over into real-world violence</a>, after that content had been allowed to thrive on the platform <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/what-qanon-guide-conspiracy-theory-taking-hold-among-trump-supporters-n897271\">for years</a>.</p>\n<p>Facebook also just broadened its rules prohibiting voter intimidation to ban calls for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/facebook-poll-watching-trump-election-political-ads/\">poll watching that use militaristic language</a>, like the Trump campaign&#8217;s own effort to recruit an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/biden-campaign-facebook-letter-trump-jr-army-for-trump/\">&#8220;Army for Trump&#8221;</a> to hold its political enemies to account on election day. The company also announced that it would suspend political advertising after election night, a policy that will likely remain in place until the results of the election are clear.</p>\n<p>While President Trump has gone to great lengths to cast doubt on the integrity of vote-by-mail, mailed ballots are a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-vote-by-mail-wyden-klobuchar/\">historically very safe practice</a>. States like Oregon and Colorado already conduct their voting through the mail in normal years, and<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/vote-by-mail-states/\"> all 50 states have absentee voting</a> in place for people who can&#8217;t cast a ballot in person, whether they&#8217;re out of town or overseas serving in the military.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qQ2XGgmZW0\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-vote-by-mail-wyden-klobuchar/\">Vote-by-mail should be having its moment.

Interestingly, while they&#8217;re solving for the same problems, they have very different backgrounds and approaches.</p>\n<p>Hou and Sofman started out by talking about why they were pursuing the trucking market in the first place. (Quotes have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;The market is massive; I think in the United States, $700-$800 billion a year is spent on the trucking industry. It&#8217;s continuing to grow every single year,&#8221; said Sofman, who joined Waymo from Anki last year to lead the effort in freight. &#8220;And there&#8217;s a huge shortage of drivers today, which is only going to increase over the next period of time. It&#8217;s just such a clear need. But it&#8217;s not going to be overnight — there&#8217;s still a really long tail of challenges that you can&#8217;t avoid. So the way we talk about it is the things that are hardest are just different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really the cost and reward analysis, thinking about building the operating system,&#8221; said Hou. &#8220;The cost is the number of features that you develop, and the reward is basically how many miles are you driving — you charge on a per mile basis. From that cost-reward analysis, trucking is simply the natural way to go for us. The total number of issues that you need to solve is probably 10 times less, but maybe, you know, five times harder.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard to quantify those numbers, though,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;but you get my point.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"AtOkcwaE4W\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks/\">TuSimple seeking $250 million in new funding to scale self-driving trucks</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;TuSimple seeking $250 million in new funding to scale self-driving trucks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/tusimple-seeking-250-million-in-new-funding-to-scale-self-driving-trucks/embed/#?secret=AtOkcwaE4W\" data-secret=\"AtOkcwaE4W\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The two also discussed the complexity of creating a perceptual framework good enough to drive with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if you have perfect knowledge of the world, you have to predict what other objects and agents are going to do in that environment, and then make a decision yourself and the combination knows is very challenging,&#8221; said Sofman.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really helped us is a realization from the car side of the of the company many, many years ago that in order to help us solve this problem in the easiest way possible, and facilitate the challenges downstream, we had to create our own sensors,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And so we have our own lidar, our own radar, our own cameras, and they have incredibly unique properties that were custom designed through five generations of hardware that try to really lean into the kind of most challenging situations that you just can&#8217;t avoid on the road.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GnDwnMK941\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/\">WTF is lidar?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;WTF is lidar?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/embed/#?secret=GnDwnMK941\" data-secret=\"GnDwnMK941\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Hou explained that while many autonomous systems are descended from the approaches used in the famous DARPA Grand Challenge 15 years ago, TuSimple&#8217;s is a little more anthropomorphic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m heavily influenced by my background, which has a tinge of neuroscience.

Which is more about understanding the objects, understanding their attributes, even though some of the attributes may not directly contribute to the entire self-driving system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re combining all the different, seemingly useless features together, so that we can reconstruct the so-called &#8216;qualia&#8217; of the perception of the world,&#8221; continued Hou. &#8220;By doing that we find we have all the ingredients that we need to do whatever missions that we have.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qmk47yXdKj\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/waymos-self-driving-trucks-and-minivans-are-headed-to-new-mexico-and-texas/\">Waymo&#8217;s self-driving trucks and minivans are headed to New Mexico and Texas</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Waymo&#8217;s self-driving trucks and minivans are headed to New Mexico and Texas&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/waymos-self-driving-trucks-and-minivans-are-headed-to-new-mexico-and-texas/embed/#?secret=qmk47yXdKj\" data-secret=\"qmk47yXdKj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The two found themselves in disagreement over the idea that due to the major differences between highway driving and street-level driving, there are essentially two distinct problems to be solved.</p>\n<p>Hou was of the opinion that &#8220;the overlap is rather small. Human society has declared certain types of rules for driving on the highway … this is a much more regulated system. But for local driving there&#8217;s actually no rules for interaction … in fact very different implicit social constructs to drive in different areas of the world. These are things that are very hard to model.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sofman, on the other hand, felt that while the problems are different, solving one contributes substantially to solving the other: &#8220;If you break up the problem into the many, many building blocks of an AV system, there&#8217;s a pretty huge leverage where even if you don&#8217;t solve the problem 100% it takes away 85%-90% of the complexity. We use the exact same sensors, exact same compute infrastructures, simulation framework, the perception system carries over, very largely, even if we have to retrain some of the models. The core of all of our algorithms are, we&#8217;re working to keep them the same.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can see the rest of that last exchange in the video above.

At the market&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/bvp-nasdaq-emerging-cloud-index\">current multiples</a>, YCharts was likely worth between 10 and 20x times its ARR, making the deal (presuming, say, $13.5 million ARR at the time of the sale) worth between $135 million and $270 million, unless LLR managed to secure a discount, or the firm&#8217;s economics were worse than we&#8217;d imagine from our current remove.</p>\n<p>The companies declined to share details of the transaction, including price.</p>\n<p>As a somewhat long-term YCharts user &#8212; the startup set up custom colors in my account so that I could <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1300817739356012546\">share charts in TechCrunch green</a>, which was fun &#8212; the deal is notable in that I&#8217;ve come to appreciate what the service is capable of; it&#8217;s a great tool to create charts that encompass a wealth of financial data to make a clear point, like the historical trends in Tesla&#8217;s price/sales ratio compared to other automotive players, for example.</p>\n<p>Financial tooling that is accessible, and shareable, is rare in our Bloomberg world. So here&#8217;s to hoping that  the transactions promised investment into YCharts bears out.</p>\n<p>Turning to the why, I asked YCharts why it didn&#8217;t merely raise external capital instead of selling itself. YCharts&#8217; CEO Sean Brown wrote that he&#8217;s &#8220;found that capital is easy to get,&#8221; but that &#8220;<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/llr-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"llr-partners\">LLR Partners <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> provides [YCharts] with much more than just capital.&#8221; The investing group, Brown continued, shares his company&#8217;s vision, has &#8220;strong domain experience,&#8221; along with &#8220;a dedicated team focused on fintech, and a ton of relevant strategic and operational expertise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The CEO also stressed LLR&#8217;s prior investments into other fintech companies, and said that &#8220;as part of the buyout of our existing shareholders, LLR will be funding capital to YCharts’ balance sheet to support continued investment in product and sales [and] marketing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>YCharts raised capital as an independent company across a number of rounds, including a 2010 Series A led by Hyde Park Angels and I2A Fund, and a Series B and C led by Morningstar.

The landing page of the app features a scrolling feed of YouTube videos, with tabs at the bottom that allow users to visit other mainstream Western internet services.</p>\n<p>While some celebrate the app as an unprecedented &#8220;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RitaBai/status/1314539100343476224?s=20\">opening up</a>&#8221; of the Chinese internet, others quickly noticed the browser comes with a veil of censorship.

Registration requires a Chinese phone number, which is tied to a person&#8217;s real identity. The platform could suspend users&#8217; accounts and share their data &#8220;with the relevant authorities&#8221; if they &#8220;actively watch or share&#8221; content that breaches the constitution, endangers national security and sovereignty, spreads rumors, disrupts social orders, or violates other local laws, according to the app&#8217;s terms of service.</p>\n<p>Rather than blocking sites that are beyond the purview of Beijing and tracking individuals using VPNs to circumvent the Great Firewall, China now has an app that gives its people a glimpse into the Western internet &#8212; with the caveat that their digital footprint may be under close watch by the authorities.</p>\n<p>Much about the app remains unclear, such as its origin and the motive behind it. The operator of the app&#8217;s official website (上海丰炫信息技术有限公司) is 70% owned by a subsidiary of Qihoo 360, a Chinese cybersecurity software giant.

Europe and China will become even more complicated in the future, and we see the transformation coming up very quickly. And to a certain point of time, developing and producing combustion engines and cars around this technology will become even more expensive than a battery vehicle. Things are moving very fast.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Governments worldwide are using aggressive regulations to push automakers toward an electric future, though that goal doesn&#8217;t address the millions of gasoline-powered vehicles already on the road.</p>\n<p>Von Platen explains that it&#8217;s Porsche&#8217;s goal to reach the commitments laid out by the Paris Climate Accord ahead of schedule. To do so means reducing the environmental impact of the entire car industry, and Porsche sees eFuels as a way to reduce the environmental impact of current and future internal combustion vehicles. If produced using renewable energy, it would result in ICE-powered vehicles being powered by a renewable source fuel.</p>\n<p>Porsche is in a unique position: 70% of the vehicles it ever produced are still on the road. Their owners are generally enthusiastic and unlikely to trade-in their classic air-cooled Porsche coupes for an electric vehicle. The company sees eFuel as a way to reduce the environmental impact of those vehicles while keeping them on the road.</p>\n<p>This new type of synthetic fuel is produced out of hydrogen and CO2. Porsche says that this fuel shares properties with kerosene, diesel and gasoline produced from crude oil in its most basic term.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This technology is particularly important because the combustion engine will continue to dominate the automotive world for many years to come,&#8221; said Michael Steiner, member of the Executive Board, Research and Development, <a href=\"https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2020/company/porsche-research-synthetic-fuels-efuels-development-22026.html\">in a statement released in September</a>. &#8220;If you want to operate the existing fleet in a sustainable manner, eFuels are a fundamental component.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Synthetic fuels were tried in the past and gained little long-term traction. Porsche wants to influence this new breed of synthetic fuel specifications to ensure the eFuel works within Porsche&#8217;s performance engines. &#8220;When E10 came onto the market, the blend had some disadvantages. It must be different this time: it must have advantages,&#8221; Steiner said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We started a pilot program to talk about the industrialization of this fuel technology to make it cheaper, as it is still quite expensive compared to fossil fuels,&#8221; von Platen said. &#8220;If this works in the future, we can have something that will increase the speed of creating sustainability besides battery technology.&#8221;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Full Panel &#8212;

By 2019, those figures rose to 150 to 200 rounds per quarter, worth between $700 million and $950 million.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>To see Q3 2020 manage just 136 rounds worth just $434 million is a sharp disappointment.</p>\n<p>The depressing results come not during a time of sharply lower <em>aggregate </em>venture capital results, notably. Recent data concerning Q3 2020 <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/technology/moneytree.html\">compiled by PwC</a> indicates that the quarter was relatively rich.

Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>\n<h2>A diversity downturn?</h2>\n<p>Cards on the table, I think it&#8217;s better when venture capital is more diversely distributed. Why? Because when there&#8217;s more general access to funds, we&#8217;ll see a more varied set of products built to attack a more diverse set of issues and problems. Even more, venture capital can be a pathway to financial success for founders and employees, so investing it in all sorts of folks instead of one particular demographic set can spread the wealth around more equitably.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/-97mfaD4FYk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:15:12 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300","linkMd5":"17488540bb3d1158438851075a4c1b36","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-11-50-080_9086aabfeefee685.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32544,"destBytes":32544,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn15@2020_5/2020/10/09/19-11-50-080_9086aabfeefee685.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-11-46-714_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_4/2020/10/09/19-12-10-137_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-09-192_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn83@2020_6/2020/10/09/19-12-09-192_9ff0b39285ec0356.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=-97mfaD4FYk:4WYUbMTc_F0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn19@2020_3/2020/10/09/19-12-10-082_ab48ed1df2391281.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn76@2020_1/2020/10/09/19-12-10-365_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/-97mfaD4FYk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_2/2020/10/09/19-12-13-799_27ed2e638a751d17.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602270697609},{"createdTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:37","updatedTime":"2020-10-10 03:11:37","title":"Daily Crunch: Waymo opens up driverless ride-hailing","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2058530","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Alphabet&#8217;s self-driving technology company hits a major milestone, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> TV+ extends its free subscription period and Affirm files to go public.
