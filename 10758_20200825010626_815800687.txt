One downside: while the game is free the distributor has put video ads between each level and you cannot pay to make the ads go away. Bummer.

It’s also great to have around for a fast breakfast of an over easy egg on rice, which I default to a lot when I’m feeling lazy.</p> \n<p>I’m terrible at cooking rice in a pot (burned rice, melted pots, other tragic results) so instead I bake it using instructions from <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/baked-brown-rice-recipe.html\">Alton Brown and Good Eats</a> and no pots have been ruined since.</p> \n<p><em>To make:</em> Put 1.5 cups brown rice and a teaspoon of salt in an 8×8 baking dish. Pour 2.5 cups boiling water over the top, stir and cover tightly with tin foil. Bake in a 375 degree oven for one hour. Allow to cool, divide into portions and freeze.</p> \n<p>I do two or three batches at the same time and I’ve used larger baking dishes and even pie plates with good results, no need to have multiple 8×8 baking dishes hanging around. If you’re a rice texture snob this cooking method probably won’t make you happy, but hey, convenience.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/iKOCCMW447U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 12:02:55 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/bakedbrownrice1.jpg","linkMd5":"1405941ce15b96be2c7180177f2b6b00","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn30@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-15-333_9868da2fbfa47715.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":628,"sourceBytes":34424,"destBytes":20230,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/bakedbrownrice1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn30@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-15-333_9868da2fbfa47715.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/iKOCCMW447U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-20-693_e59fac7e30d49bd8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454786},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"Halloween things to make, listen to, play and decorate your nails with","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=17509","description":"<p>Here are the things that have caught my eye this Halloween:</p> \n<h3>FOOD</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/8Ex3wklhUy/\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015oct/brownieeyes.jpg\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/8Ex3wklhUy/\">Eyeball on a brownie</a> created by Christine McConnell.

We’ve been through this before and yes, it’s the <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2011/09/16/what-ive-learned-so-far-from-having-a-flooded-house\">same ceiling</a> but a completely different cause this time. Let’s pretend none of this is happening and talk about video games instead!</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/iphonegames/device6.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/device-6/id680366065?mt=8\">Device 6</a></strong><br /> I’m going to admit I have not finished this yet. I tend to play iPhone games in public situations (on the bus, waiting in line) and this one will require that you either have a keen memory or the ability to take down some visible notes (codes) to enter later on. That said, it’s worth playing with your headphones on as this mostly-text game uses audible as as well as visual cues tell a story, and the game requires you to rotate and tilt the screen to advance. This game is stylish and fun. It’s won a bunch of Best of 2013 awards and I agree. Awesomeness. $3.99 in the app store.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/iphonegames/blackbar3.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackbar/id672002602?mt=8\">Blackbar</a></strong><br /> This is a fun combination of fill-in-the-word and future fiction. You are a viewer into a series of digital conversations between an all-seeing dictatorship, a rebel group and a friend caught in the middle. Your only clues are the context of the story you’re reading. It can be frustrating if you just cannot get one of the words and you are prevented from advancing. That said, if you just don’t know the answer it’s easy (too easy?) to Google and find a spoiler in return. This is one of those instances where if you love the story it’s worth engaging a friend to Google the answers and give you more gentle clues. $2.99 in the app store.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/iphonegames/pkpkt.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pkpkt/id687362268?mt=8\">PKPKT</a></strong><br /> This is a simple game that uses Bluetooth to detect other players nearby and whoever reacts first can pick the others virtual pocket. It’s amazingly fun to get a notification of somebody nearby while you’re riding a bus or arriving at a party. But, there aren’t nearly enough players yet which is why I need you all to play. It’s got the potential to be epically fun. Free.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/iphonegames/homesheephome2.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shaun-sheep-home-sheep-home/id460909018?mt=8\">Home Sheep Home 2</a></strong><br /> I <em>heart</em> everything that <a href=\"http://www.aardman.com/\">Aardman Studios</a> does so I’m a wee bit embarrassed that it took me so long to play their Home Sheep Home 2 puzzle platformer involving Shaun the Sheep and his usual suspects. In each screen you’ve got to solve some puzzles to get three sheep to the exit. Each sheep has a different ability, one jumps high, one pushes heavy things, one fits through small spaces, and you’ll need all three to solve each level. The soundtrack, humor, personalities of the sheep and the crisp sound effects make a very charming game that is balanced with just enough difficulty. As you progress there are new elements presented (gravity!) and as you play there are collectibles for us completionists. That said, if you tend to play casual games in a web browser some of the levels are available online: <a href=\"http://www.shaunthesheep.com/games/hsh2underground/\">Underground</a>, <a href=\"http://www.shaunthesheep.com/games/homesheephome2/\">Lost In London</a>, as well as the original <a href=\"http://www.shaunthesheep.com/games/homesheephome/\">Home Sheep Home</a>. $.99 in the app store. (Home Sheep Home 1 is also available for $.99 but know that it’s a much shorter game.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/iphonegames/snailbob.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snail-bob/id534160364?mt=8\">Snail Bob</a></strong><br /> This is similar to Shaun the Sheep, you have to get the snail to the exit on each screen. You click to move things out of the way, manipulate gravity and the like and in each level there are three stars hiding. It’s not as stylized as Home Sheep Home but it makes my problem solving pleasure centers happy.

(You know how to know when you’ve become an adult? When you no longer have foodstuffs that don’t require thirty minutes of cooking and other ingredients to make them edible. That’s how.) We had almost nothing to eat in our house but I just couldn’t get myself to put on pants that were respectable enough to go to the grocery store. And then (!), accompanied by rays of sunlight and angelic music, I found a jar of homemade tomato sauce in the back of my freezer. Suddenly (or with ten-ish minutes of effort) I’d gone from So Hungry to eating delicious tomato sauce on polenta (always stock corn grits for times like this) topped with an egg. I ate this again for lunch since new food hadn’t magically appeared in my fridge. Having this tomato sauce in my freezer made me feel like a genius. Or at least somebody who is occasionally able to feed myself with dignity.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015jan/tomatosauce_ingredients.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>This sauce I refer to is Marcella Hazan’s tomato sauce with onion and butter. Its an amazingly simple and delicious recipe so if you’re already familiar with it then <em>high five</em>, and if you’re not already familiar with it then you’re in for a treat. This is how it goes:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> – a 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes, with the juice<br /> – one onion peeled and cut in half<br /> – 5 tablespoons of butter<br /> – a pinch of salt if needed</p> \n <p>Simmer uncovered for 45 minutes. Done. </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Ok, there is a little more than that. You let the whole thing simmer slowly for about 45 minutes and near the end crush the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Discard the onion before serving. Done and done.</p> \n<p>For a more detailed version of this see <a href=\"http://orangette.blogspot.com/2007/09/start-with-tomato-sauce.html\">Orangette</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.amateurgourmet.com/2013/09/marcella-hazans-immortal-tomato-sauce-recipe.html\">Amateur Gourmet</a>, or <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/01/tomato-sauce-with-butter-and-onions/\">Smitten Kitchen</a>.</p> \n<p>For this recipe I make a double batch. Doubled it fits in a 4-quart dutch oven nicely and I freeze the leftovers in portions for later. I’ve been using <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008586UGM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008586UGM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=EGBGGMIVXS57GX4Z\">small canning jars</a> (note: affiliate links) with the very handy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC4B/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000BYC4B&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=GTDNHSNM73Q7QOHB\">plastic screw caps</a> lately for freezing foods, it’s easy to take of the lid and thaw the whole thing in a microwave. Or at least I find the jars less fuss than I anticipated them to be. I bought a bunch of jars a few years back expecting they’d eventually be cycled out of my house when giving food gifts to friends and I’ve honestly been surprised at how much I enjoy using them for dry food storage and freezer storage. The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC4B/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000BYC4B&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=GTDNHSNM73Q7QOHB\">caps</a>, though, make all the difference. They are easier to remove and clean and keep track of and won’t rust.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015jan/tomatosauce_scissors.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>This is a little tip I learned somewhere that I cannot recall. (I think Cook’s Illustrated?) If you want to break up whole canned tomatoes with as little mess as possible use kitchen scissors to cut them up while they are still in the can. This recipe doesn’t require you break up the tomatoes first but I do it anyway because I can get a little obsessive over smashing the tomatoes later on and I like to give myself a head start. I’ve read that when deciding whether to buy whole or diced or crushed canned tomatoes it’s better to buy whole because there is less processing time before the tomatoes hit the can so they are fresher. I’m not sure if this is true but it’s good to keep in mind. Maybe a taste test is in order?</p> \n<p>While I’m here let me just say that I’m totally in love with my no-sharp-edges can opener. I know there are not exactly breaking news but every time I open a can I find myself being gushingly appreciative of not being able to cut my fingers on anything sharp. (Because I did, every time.) I own the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UERTYQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000UERTYQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=WW33LYW4QXS5HGCY\">Zyliss</a> and have no complaints. <a href=\"http://thesweethome.com/\">Sweethome</a> recommends the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L0OON0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003L0OON0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=DXE5D56X7XSK3XOK\">OXO Good Grips version</a>.

My friend <a href=\"http://www.leslieseaton.com/\">Leslie</a> introduced me to the concept of <a href=\"http://instagram.com/tinycheese\">tiny cheese</a>, which are the smaller odd bits and ends of cheese left over when a grocery store has portioned out and packaged chunks off of a larger wheel. There is usually a small basket of cheese ends tucked in the display case, most for $1 or $2. These tiny cheeses had always been there in grocery stores but for some reason I had never noticed them, so thank you Leslie! Just in case you overlook them too consider this a gentle nudge to have a peek next time you pass them. This past summer the tiny cheeses have provided me with timely moments of fresh mozzarella, queso fresco to accompany a few grilled peppers for dinner, parmesan when I only needed a small portion as I’d be leaving on a trip in a few days. You get the idea, tiny cheeses are great.</p> \n<p>This small collection of cheese cost me under $7 and include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://somerdale.co.uk/products/long-clawson-cotswold.aspx\">Long Clawson English Cotswold</a>, which had onions and chives and was sort of like the Everything Bagel of cheese</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.greatcheese.com/cheese/le-chatelain.php\">Le Chatelain French Brie</a> which was creamy and insanely good</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.cascadiacreamery.com/our_organic_cheese.html\">Cascadia Creamery Raw Sleeping Beauty</a> which is a hard cheese, and very delicious</li> \n <li><a hef=\"http://www.tillamook.com/products/cheese/pepper-jack.html\">Tillamook Pepper Jack</a>, spicy and dependable</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.artequeso.com/en/blog/art1.html\">Buenalba Goat Cheese With Paprika</a>, which was my favorite, subtle and colorful</li> \n</ul> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/TLpqrfcOw9c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 20:55:53 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014oct/tinycheeses.jpg","linkMd5":"8497521b5e437bf240d265564bbba10a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn33@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-18-961_d406c24b14440364.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":345,"sourceBytes":63052,"destBytes":21174,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014oct/tinycheeses.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn33@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-18-961_d406c24b14440364.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/TLpqrfcOw9c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-22-928_c41aed1b7a9d805f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454781},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"links: craft","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=16633","description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.hapticlab.com/collections/diy-kits\">DIY Kits | Haptic Lab</a>.

Rereading it just now I find that a startled china cow has it’s leg broken off! Happily the cow could be mended but, still, eeek. In the book Dorothy and her companions pass through the land of China Country and then there isn’t any more mention, but for some reason I’ve always remembered it. Happily we will see a lot more of China Country (called China County in the film) and the China Princess in the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.legendsofozmovie.com\">Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return</a> film, which opens this weekend. (Quick note: sound plays when you load that website. It’s lovely music but, just in case, I wanted you to know.)</p> \n<p>To celebrate the film I decided to make tea cakes themed around places in Oz including China County and Candy County. The icing I used here doesn’t require any heat or electric mixers to make, it’s stirred together by hand, so young children can be responsible for icing and decorating these cakes.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/candy.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>I wanted to keep things fairly simple and shopped for candies that could represent the various places in Oz. I found rainbow sour ribbon candy, green rock candy for the Emerald City, orange nonpareils for the field of poppies, yellow cake sprinkles for the Yellow Brick Road, chocolate cones and mushrooms that would work as forest trees, sugar roses and gold dragees for China County and gingersnaps and peppermint candies to represent Candy County.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/muffins.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>I wanted to create small cakes but instead of buying a baking pan specifically for them (they are out there if you’d like) I used jumbo sized cupcake pans and put a smaller amount of batter in each cup making for small and charmingly domed cakes. Since my cakes are little landscapes I used chocolate cake to represent earth but any flavor of cake, or even a brownie, would work out great here. This is a good time for your favorite one-bowl chocolate cake recipe.</p> \n<h3>Cake Instructions</h3> \n<ul>\n  Spray a jumbo muffin tin with a baking spray such as Baker’s Joy. Put 3 tablespoons of cake batter in each section and bake at 300 degrees until a tester comes out clean. Allow to cool, remove from the tin and place on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. \n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/scale.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>The icing is simply confectioners sugar and milk mixed together by hand. I made white icing for the porcelain of China Country and the snow of Candy Country, and the rest of the icing is colored green to represent grass. I used clear vanilla flavoring so the white icing would stay as white as could be. The great things about this icing are that it’s as simple to make and it sets up into a beautiful shiny finish, like porcelain. The downside is that it doesn’t keep overnight very well so it’s best to make these the same day. (Or keep in a sealed container in the fridge overnight.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/icingbowls.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>The trick for the icing is to make sure it’s as thick as can be while still being a little bit flowy. Add the ingredients listed below and if it’s thick like a paste add 1/4th of a teaspoon of milk at a time until the icing feels thick when you stir it but it relaxes and becomes shiny about 10 seconds after you stop stirring. 1/4th of a teaspoon seems like a tiny little amount but you’ll be surprised at how quickly that amount will change the texture of the icing.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/icingbowl1.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/icingbowl2.jpg\" /></p> \n<h3>Icing Instructions</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>9 ounces confectioners sugar (or two cups of of confectioners sugar that you’ve fluffed up by running a whisk through it before scooping)</li> \n <li>2 tablespoons milk (plus more)</li> \n <li>1 teaspoon clear vanilla flavoring</li> \n <li>green food coloring</li> \n <p>Mix the ingredients above together in a bowl. If the icing is thick like a paste or not all the sugar will dissolve in the milk add 1/4th of a teaspoon of milk at a time just until the mixture is still matte when you stir but relaxes and becomes shiny a few seconds after you stop mixing. Either separate it and make 1/2 of the mixture green or make a second batch. One batch will cover twelve cakes. </p>\n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/icingapplication.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Drop a heaping soup spoon of icing on top of each cake.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/icingsettle.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Be a little patient and let it settle and spread. Now quick! Before the top dries it’s time to decorate!</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/road.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>A little bit of sour rainbow ribbon candy works for our rainbow. I used a butter knife to poke into the cake and hold the rainbow in place</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/singlerose.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Simple sugar roses and gold dragées echo China County.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/singleemeraldcity.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Green rock candy represents our Emerald City and tiny orange nonpareils for our field of poppies.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/singlecandy.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Candy County is full of gingerbread house delights, here I used half of a ginger snap and some peppermint candy.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/loz/singleforest.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Small chocolate cookies from a Japanese import store work as trees in the forest.

It was part of their <a href=\"http://www.kingarthurflour.com/bakeforgood/\">Bake for Good</a> initiative to encourage and help people reach out to their communities in various ways. In addition to getting food to those in need, baking for community events and bake sales to raise money they also have a Bake for Good Kids traveling tour that helps kids learn to bake and work with their communities. In addition to all this King Arthur Flour is an employee owned company where each employee donates time each year to volunteering and helping the community. You know what? There’s been a lot of gloomy stuff going on in the news lately and being a part of the Bake for Good tour reminded me that there is plenty of goodness out there and sometimes you have to create it.</p> \n<p>(The image above is from the King Arthur Flour website. The pictures below are all from my aging iPhone, the days were so packed with flour and butter and dishwashing that I didn’t pull out my camera.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/bread_beforeafter.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>(My bread was a little lopsided but bascially worked. The one here looked so pretty I took a picture of it instead.)</p> \n<p>We spent some time in commercial kitchens which was a thrill for me. On the first day we made braided white loaves, dinner rolls and apple pies.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/braiding.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>We braided white bread dough, you start from the center and braid down, then flip it over and braid down again. Not as easy as it sounds, at least the first time.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/braidedbread_sidebyside.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>It rose! And got brown and pretty!</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/pie_beforeafter.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>I’ve never been able to get a handle on pie dough. I’d seen plenty of demonstrations on cooking shows, I’d done the vodka thing, the food processor thing but I never had any success and basically gave up on it. Turns out some hands on learning with a cheerfully helpful teacher is what I needed.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/pie_inbowl.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>What I learned? Half of the butter bits need to be way larger than I suspected. And one of these <a href=\"http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/king-arthur-bowl-scraper\">large plastic scrapers</a> is oh so handy. Seriously, I won’t ever make pie dough without one of these again. It’s particularly great if you don’t have cold hands because it can mix and fold with minimal contact from your hands. It’s also great for scooping up chopped vegetables, even easier to use than a metal bench scraper. There you, my new favorite kitchen multitasker.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/pie_readytochill.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>In my notes I have VB, which stands for Visible Butter, something you want during the last stages of putting your pie dough together. When you are gathering it to chill before rolling out you want the dough to be both shaggy and crumbly, not too dry but just wet enough to hold together. Right, I’m not going to do any good telling you about it, go find a pie person and practice!</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/macandcheese.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>The next day we made salad, macaroni and cheese, chicken and a few other vegetable side options. I appreciated the oversized tools.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/utensils.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>We had a tour of the shelter and it was pretty sobering. Everybody there was a good soul caught in a difficult situation. It made me feel very grateful for what I have and like I could be doing a lot more to help out in my community. I’ll be seeking out as many opportunities to volunteer as I can.</p> \n<p>If you like to cook I do have a suggestion for helping out in your area, look up your local VA hospital and see if they are seeking volunteers to cook dinner for the caretakers of patients who are living there are on a short or long term basis. Here in Seattle the <a href=\"http://www.fisherhousevaps.org/how-to-donate--volunteer.html\">Fisher House</a> is one of those spots, this is something my friend <a href=\"http://www.freshpickedseattle.com/\">Fresh Picked Seattle</a> organizes from time to time so all credit goes to her. In addition to cooking they have room for people to come and hold craft nights, garden, organize outings or teach a class.</p> \n<p>Alright, let’s go out and do some good.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/XAVFL2PjAwM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 May 2014 15:36:58 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/bakeforgood.jpg","linkMd5":"03d4f17a7b3343d795346e898c6973d5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn87@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-15-334_ba1a68edb3ee1ffa.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":335,"sourceBytes":31208,"destBytes":13094,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/bakeforgood.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn87@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-15-334_ba1a68edb3ee1ffa.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/bread_beforeafter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn59@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-24-244_522cb94d580679f8.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/braiding.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-26-021_ec584fa895fda465.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/braidedbread_sidebyside.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-22-620_f3df4fbc25abd94b.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/pie_beforeafter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-24-110_c45c3c141b1de4cf.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/pie_inbowl.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-20-624_c850901ab95e57a7.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/pie_readytochill.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-20-135_7c22c3e37d46dd8b.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/macandcheese.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn31@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-21-237_1d7a8689400a8fd5.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/bakeforgood/utensils.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn92@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-23-125_d0e88bc2566632eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/XAVFL2PjAwM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-22-951_d6e90b2af84d8b90.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454784},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"links: misc","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=16515","description":"<p><a href=\"http://makezine.com/craft/death-star-gown/\">Death Star Gown | MAKE: Craft</a>.

There is a restaurant near us, <a href=\"http://www.bardelcorso.com/\">Bar del Corso</a>, that serves wine in low, wide tumblers. I’ve always found them very pleasing so I was happy to find <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10278356/\">similarly shaped glasses</a> at Ikea recently and they’ve become my default vessel for sipping rose wine out of. Two things: at $3 for a set of six glasses they are ridiculously affordable, and if you buy them pay attention to how the packaging they come in unfolds into a single rectangle of cardboard, it’s a remarkable feat of engineering.</p> \n<p>We’ve also been using these for cocktails but they aren’t necessarily ideal as lowball/Old Fashioned glasses, especially if you’re really into your ice and are using ice spheres. The average ice ball is taller than these glasses which makes for some awkward sipping. We’ve been using the ice sphere molds from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ACTN54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007ACTN54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=R2VKORQ5L3HLAGDJ\">Tovolo</a> recently which are 2.5″ in diameter and they are definitely too large in this particular glass, but the ice from the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00395FHRO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00395FHRO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=TT4B57ZNWC56AQ6Y\">King Ice Cube Tray</a> fit nicely.</p> \n<p>These also work great as little serving dishes and are shown here with a few of my current favorite snacks from Trader Joe’s: Crunchy Curls and Dark Chocolate Almonds with sea salt which aren’t pretty but they are unstoppably delicious. I can’t stop eating them send help. Back to the tumblers, I recently spotted the <a href=\"http://www.westelm.com/products/bodega-glassware-d1250/?pkey=cglassware-coasters|drinking-glasses-glassware|&amp;cm_src=glassware-coasters||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_--_-#\">same size/shape</a> of glasses at West Elm that had thinner walls, they were definitely finer glassware. Looks like CB2 carries <a href=\"http://www.cb2.com/low-rider-tasting-glass/s226916\">some of the same style</a> as well.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015jun/ikea_bowls.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>#2: Big bowls. We live in a part of town with lots of pho restaurants, it’s far easier to find great pho than a burger. Pho is best eaten out of nice big bowls but we didn’t have those so we were using two different sized glass mixing bowls, it looked kinda silly. I somehow convinced myself that the healing powers of this soup were diminished by lack of proper bowls so I set out to find ones that would work. It’s summer now but hey look, I finally found the perfect bowls! They are also great for nights when you need a Really Big Salad for dinner. Or a Really Big Bowl Of Pasta. You know.</p> \n<p>These are <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80279687/\">9″ serving bowls</a> that are almost half spheres, a very pleasing size and shape. According to the description these are made from a porcelain that is lightweight, strong and will hopefully stand up to my clumsy handling. If the price on these seems a little high to you the <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90234863/\">Skack</a> serving bowl at Ikea is the exact same size and shape but it’s made from stoneware that is a little thicker and heavier.</p> \n<p>I’ve shown the bowls here filled with popcorn because it was 84 degrees the day I took this photo and hot soup just didn’t seem that appealing. I added the chopsticks for scale and also because I’m really terrible at using chopsticks and I’ve been using popcorn to train myself. Someday I <em>will</em> be able to get through an entire meal without needing to ask for a fork.</p> \n<p><strong>update:</strong> We use these bowls so often I went back to buy two more and discovered that they aren’t quite the same as the ones we originally purchased. The new batch it’s quite as bright white, they are a significant bit heavier and they lack the incredible glossy smooth finish. Subtle differences but somehow all the charm has been sucked out of the final product. Still, a nice big bowl has become an important part of making a big salad into a particularly fine dinner option.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/dVYoYN5qx-8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 15:00:55 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015jun/ikea_glasses.jpg","linkMd5":"bfcf7bca41fa5cc8ad2288d2b1da539d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn1@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-15-972_99ef554ac9b3c229.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":333,"sourceBytes":45487,"destBytes":28424,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015jun/ikea_glasses.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn1@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-15-972_99ef554ac9b3c229.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015jun/ikea_bowls.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-22-465_31113da373285a6e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/dVYoYN5qx-8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-23-763_3ebc0bc976dc9091.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454778},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"Mobile Games To Keep You Happily Distracted","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=17450","description":"<p>Here are some mobile/tablet games that I recommend for keeping you distracted during long stretches of travel or just during the dark winter nights. (I played all of these on iOS but I’ve linked to the developers websites for each game and noted what platforms they are available on.) They aren’t new but these are the ones that I found memorable and keep around for replaying in the future. At the bottom of this post is a list of little puzzle games that keep me happily distracted while waiting in lines at the airport. Happy travels everybody!</p> \n<section class=\"bottompadding\"> \n <h3>Long Mobile Puzzle and Adventure Games</h3> \n</section> \n<section class=\"bottompadding\"> \n <a href=\"http://www.swingswingsubmarine.com/games/tetrobot-and-co/\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015dec/mobilegames/tetrobot.jpg\" /></a> \n <p><a href=\"http://www.swingswingsubmarine.com/games/tetrobot-and-co/\">Tetrobot and Co</a><br /> I am very, very obsessed with this game. This is a cute and stylish puzzle game that hits all the right spots – the controls are easy to pick up, there aren’t any Running Against The Clock levels, there is a rewind button that will take you back one step at a time, and the puzzles are just difficult enough to make you feel like a GENIUS when you solve them but never quite get frustrating. There are plenty of elements to make completionists happy including some play-it-again challenges that make early levels that much more challenging. In Tetrobo and Co. you pilot a tiny robot through each level moving and arranging blocks to make your way to the exit. The blocks have different properties (magnetic, reflective, impervious to fire, stick to the walls). These are all very familiar game concepts but the levels here are especially clever, often requiring a bit of extra discovery on your part to solve. As you go along new physics are introduced so the puzzles never get repetitive. I found the clicky/whirry/buzzy sounds in this game particularly appealing and the soundtrack changes for each set of levels. There is a sweet little background story that is revealed as you solve things that is safe to ignore if that’s not your thing, it’s a continuation of story behind Swing Swing Submarine’s previous game, Blocks That Matter.</p> \n <p>What else? The main protagonist in this game, the one who built the tiny robot, is a girl. The game is completely safe for kids (but please don’t tell me if your seven year old found the whole game really easy, my ego will be crushed). It was originally built for PC and is available on Steam, but it was clearly designed with touch screen in mind. I’ve played the predecessor to this game, Blocks That Matter, on my laptop and found the levels just as clever but occasionally more dependent on frustrating time elements (for example, a series of crates catching on fire, a constantly oncoming boss monster). I was able to get through all of the main levels without rage quitting and can definitely recommend playing it.</p> \n <p>I’ve been trying to describe to friends why I like Tetrobot and Co so much and I’ve been comparing it to the Portal games because of how smart it makes me feel when I solve a level. I’m currently giving this game a rest in the hopes that I forget all the tricks and solutions so I can play it all over again. Save for kids? Yes. App Store/Steam/Google Play/Humble Store/GOG.<br /> </p>\n</section> \n<section class=\"bottompadding\"> \n <a href=\"http://oceanhorn.blogspot.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015dec/mobilegames/oceanhorn.jpg\" /></a> \n <p><a href=\"http://oceanhorn.blogspot.com/\">Oceanhorn</a><br /> Reviewers compare this to a Zelda game (Wind Walker era) and they aren’t wrong. In this game you play a young boy who explores islands, swings a sword, shoots arrows at monsters, finds hidden caves and, yes, defeats a few boss monsters all in the effort to save the world and find his long lost father. I’m not partial to console-like games on the iPad but this one won me over in a big way and I’ve played all the way through it twice. The monsters that you encounter as you explore the world aren’t difficult to defeat (though they do respawn the moment you leave each area) and I had less trouble with the boss monsters than I feared (with a little help from some walkthroughs, I admit, because ugh boss monsters ugh). While you do encounter plenty of monsters the game is well balanced with lots of time for exploration on each new island, and a few towns where you can stock up. There are lots of hidden areas, completionist elements and reasons to revisit old areas (like magic boots that allow you to cross gaps). Despite the usual meters for health/money/arrows/bombs I never found myself stuck. There has been a nice update to the game this year so I’m ready to play through it again. Safe for kids? Yes. App Store/Steam/GOG/Humble Store.<br /> </p>\n</section> \n<section class=\"bottompadding\"> \n <a href=\"http://www.brokenagegame.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015dec/mobilegames/brokenage.jpg\" /></a> \n <p><a href=\"http://www.brokenagegame.com/\">Broken Age</a><br /> Disclosure: I played this on PC because I was a Kickstarter backer and that was the option available. Having played it and carefully scoured reviews for the touch screen version of the game I’m pretty sure that you won’t miss having a mouse and keyboard when playing this game.</p> \n <p>Broken Age is a brand new retro style point and click adventure game of the sort I grew up playing. It’s more about the story and a bit less about the puzzles and I absolutely loved it. The graphics looks like watercolors, the characters are all voiced incredibly well (and by lots of names you’ll recognize) and I absolutely fell in love with all the characters. There is humor and heart and randomness and a little bit of “I have a bucket, a skirt and a mirror and I need to convince a sentient vine to let me jump into the pit” that you’ll recognize if you’ve played these sorts of games before.</p> \n <p>The world of the game is split between two characters/worlds that you can switch between if you are feeling stuck with one storyline or the other and I bet you’ve already guessed that at some point the storylines cross. For as much as I love the world that Doublefine has created and I love this sort of game, there isn’t a lot of puzzling or defeating going on here and after a while it becomes clear that no matter how many amusing conversation threads there are you’ll eventually be lead towards the only one that counts. This didn’t make me love the game any less, but if you’re not a fan of the King’s Quest era games this isn’t one that will change your mind. Safe for kids? Yes. App Store/Steam/PS4/PS Vita/Google Play.<br /> </p>\n</section> \n<section class=\"bottompadding\"> \n <a href=\"http://www.relentless.co.uk/games/blue-toad-murder-files\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015dec/mobilegames/murderfiles.jpg\" /></a> \n <p><a href=\"http://www.relentless.co.uk/games/blue-toad-murder-files\">Murder Files</a><br /> Everything about this game seems geared towards a younger version of me but it managed to completely delight my old self. It’s a little bit cartoonish and it’s interspersed with the style of logic puzzles that I remember being given to pass the time during long car trips. (Kids, this was before we had iPads or even, shudder, portable DVD players. Car trips were boring, grim and probably account for 95% of my lateral thinking ability.) The real star here is the narrator who manages a humorously dramatic tone and does all the character voices. Half of the game are the aforementioned logic puzzles and half is listening intently to the answers that possible suspects give which I found surprisingly tricky since my brain is so likely to tune out at the wrong moments. This whodunnit/logic puzzle combination is something I’ve seen in a few games but it’s executed perfectly here and I recall the story as fondly as the puzzles. Safe for kids? Yes. Except, you know, it’s about murder. Kid safe? Yes, but murder is a thing.

You can move around, zoom in, make observations and collect clues, find codes and open drawers and uncover some hidden areas. At the end of each case you answer a series of questions and uncover the guilty party. Safe for kids? No, there are some dead bodies lying around. Not gruesome but definitely grim.

The game is full of tropes – keys and locks and passcodes, hidden panels, getting a clue out of a fish tank that contains sharks, trying to get the cat to move. The game play felt slow at times (go all the way outside to get that thing, now come all the way back, now go outside again) but the puzzles and storyline kept me entertained the whole way through. Bonus points for both the secret agent and the villain being female. Safe for kids: yes but violence is implied.

The game has beautiful Samorset-like hand drawn visuals, a relaxing soundtrack, and a charming story. The elements of the gameplay involve hidden object hunting, logic puzzles, jigsaw assembly, some Simon Says (ugh), a couple of constantly moving 8-bit style mini games (which I find frustrating and overly long) and a few puzzles that just require that you put the things in the right place that are somehow simple and difficult at the same time. I don’t find any of these elements particularly swoon worthy on their own but they’ve all been brought together into a game that is (most of the time) relaxing despite all my protestations. Kid friendly? Yes.

But both of the games are amazing and you should play them, just on different systems.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.bit-blot.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/aquaria.jpg\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.bit-blot.com/\">Aquaria</a> was released for PC in 2007 and won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at IGF that year. I played it around 2009 and fell deeply in love with the game. It was adapted and became available for iOS a few years ago and after recommending it I finally bought it for my iPad mini. Everything about it was the same but just as soon as I got into the areas where combat is required I died. Over and over again. You respawn at points very close to where you die but it was still frustrating. Why did I like the game so much upon the first play through? A little bit of memory jogging and I remembered why – with the PC version you can <a href=\"http://www.bit-blot.com/forum/index.php?topic=1983.0\">gently hack the settings</a> so that your character takes damage less quickly. You’re not invincible but needing to regain energy comes at a much more reasonable pace for me. The other reason that playing on a computer has a bit of an edge is simply that there are keyboard shortcuts for triggering common things in the game that come in very handy. (One tip: If you are playing on iOS make sure you pick up your first pet before you head out to Open Waters to explore beyond the initial area of the game. Not having that was part of the reason I was expiring so quickly and why I was frustrated to the point of not continuing.)</p> \n<p>General review: In Aquaria you play as an creature who lives in underwater caves and has no memory. You set out to make discoveries and during the course of play you uncover the history of yourself as well as a set of long lost civilizations all wrapping up in the story of the creation and downfall of a god. The game is <em>vast</em> and takes a long time to play. You are in an open world, meaning you can venture into almost any area of the game at any time. There are a few features that block your way until you gain new abilities but those abilities also unlock some fast travel systems later on which is great because you will be revisiting areas. There is a map and a note system so you can mark areas to return to. The game can be at times delightful and spooky and just when you think you cannot possibly find anything new everything changes completely, and then it changes again. I adore the feeling of exploration in this game, there is an amazing amount of space to search and most every area has a secret to reveal to those who look closely. If you get stuck or want hints the <a href=\"http://www.bit-blot.com/forum/index.php?board=7.0\">forums at Bit Blot</a> are very thorough. The character development, soundtrack and story all lead to most people, including myself, having an emotional attachment. It’s one of those games to dive into in the depth of winter or if you break a bone and are immobile for a while.</p> \n<p>Bonus points for the main character and most of the secondary characters being well developed and powerful females. Game includes impressively vast open world exploration, puzzle solving, combat, resource gathering and crafting and an amazing story and soundtrack. For game nerds I’ll point out that one of the developers went on to create a game called Spelunky, you might know it?</p> \n<p>Available for <a href=\"http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/buy.html\">PC, Mac and Linux</a> (DRM free). Also on Steam.</p> \n<p>Aquaria was made by two developers, check out their other stuff: Alec Holowka’s projects can be found at <a href=\"http://infiniteammo.ca/\">Infinite Ammo</a> and see <a href=\"http://www.derekyu.com/\">Derek Yu</a>‘s site.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://thecavegame.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/thecave.jpg\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://thecavegame.com/\">The Cave</a> is a game by my beloved <a href=\"http://www.doublefine.com/\">Double Fine</a> that I hadn’t played yet but was on my radar. I bought it for my iPad and got stuck almost right away because the tablet controls are terrible. I was so frustrated I pulled up a bunch of reviews and the majority of them echoed my later conclusion – the game is great but the tablet controls are unsatisfactory and it’s worth playing the game in a different form.</p> \n<p>So next I bought the game for my <a href=\"https://www.ouya.tv/\">OUYA</a> and loved it. The game is funny and sarcastic. In the game you choose three characters (out of an available seven) to go in and explore the cave, or rather, The Cave. Each character has a different set of abilities and can reach different parts of the cave. As you progress you learn the stories of each character, and they aren’t always what they seem. The playthrough isn’t terribly long and you can replay choosing different characters to reach different parts of the cave, though there are a few areas you will play through during each pass, which can be a little repetitive the third time you play (if you want to play all the characters). My favorites were the Twins, the Scientist and the Explorer.</p> \n<p>Bonus points to the developer for making half the playable characters female. Game includes plot driven exploration, puzzle solving and humor. Available on <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/221810/\">Steam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ouya.tv/game/The-Cave/\">OUYA</a>.</p> \n<p>Double Fine has been up to some interesting stuff lately, I cannot wait for the second half of <a href=\"http://www.brokenagegame.com/\">Broken Age</a> and their older games are well worth playing, there is a special spot in my heart for <a href=\"http://www.psychonauts.com/\">Psychonauts</a> which I didn’t play until a few years ago.</p> \n<p>Let’s talk games. I have a PS3, a PC, an OUYA and an iPad. In wintertime I want games to play in my living room so the PS3 and the OUYA are my focus, otherwise I am often looking for something to pass the time on a flight so I look for games for my iPad. My PC gaming has fallen away with the exception of a few extended story lines or games bought through Steam or Kickstarter (<a href=\"http://redthreadgames.com/games/chapters/\">Dreamfall Chapters</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brokenagegame.com/\">Broken Age part 2</a> are what I’m currently anticipating). With all these platforms I’m only slightly aware of all the games out there that I know I’d like. (Even doing some link gathering for this post has led me to some gems that have been around for a while but are new to me.) Lately I’ve been depending on the podcast <a href=\"http://www.nerdist.com/podcast_channel/the-indoor-kids-channel/\">The Indoor Kids</a> for game recommendations, and they do an amazing job but their focus as been on Xbox lately. I’m looking for a website or news source that is curated enough to not be overwhelming, my usual sources – <a href=\"http://jayisgames.com/\">Jay Is Games</a>, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com\">Ars Technica</a>, <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/\">Touch Arcade</a> – are often more information than I can parse.</p> \n<p>So, <strong>I’m curious!</strong> Where do you find yourself looking for new games? What platform do you prefer? What news source do you trust?</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/XmTaY-Ph0kY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 May 2014 01:38:46 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/aquaria.jpg","linkMd5":"317e774369fbdfb9aaaf03e3978fcb09","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn45@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-15-348_b6eb71392772c0dd.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":375,"sourceBytes":57834,"destBytes":16316,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/aquaria.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn45@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-15-348_b6eb71392772c0dd.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014may/thecave.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn98@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-20-164_4e2f2f3ddb436b5e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/XmTaY-Ph0kY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn30@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-19-937_19d29d84d72996c0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454784},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"links: misc","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=16748","description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.ninthletter.com/featured_artist/artist/52/\">“What would happen if a whale suddenly appeared in the sky and then plunged down into a South American town.” at the Ninth Letter Arts &amp; Literary Journal</a>.

It comes in black, dark brown and copper. I can report that my version of these boots is still as comfortable and as waterproof as when they were new.</em></p> \n<p>These <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NQGSIA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009NQGSIA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20\">Captiva Strap</a> boots from Merrell are waterproof and as comfortable as slippers. No really, the footbed is made of something slightly squishy so they feel really lovely. They are knee high, zip all the way up and the calf was more generously sized than a few other boots I compared it to. The soles are grippy rubber and there is plenty of support for my fussy feet. The shape of the toe box means there is lots of room for movement.</p> \n<p>I brought these with me on a month long trip to England, Scotland and Ireland in November and I tempted fate by getting them at the last minute and not having a chance to break them in before we left. Yeah, a potentially stupid move on my part. But they were amazing, I didn’t get blisters or achey feet and I was warm and dry even after a few walks through very damp fields. The heel support did hit me a little higher than I would have liked and I was afraid they would rub but I was fine.</p> \n<p>Here is the thing though, I wish they looked a little nicer. They are undeniably comfort boots, they will work with a cute outfit but these aren’t boots that can be dressed up. (Not that my own opinion on this point has stopped me from trying.) Still, there a few touches that bug me. There is a faux strap wrap around the ankle with a decorative buckle which I like but halfway up there is a rivet and a few inches over that there is a metal tag that says, very small, “waterproof”. Why thanks, but I don’t think I need to be reminded of that every time I put them on. There is an elastic panel at the top but it’s on the outsides of the boot, I’m sure it’s located just there for a reason but not knowing what that reason is I wonder if they couldn’t have tucked it away on the inside to hide it away a bit. There is a small logo embossed as well, just below the ankle. All these little things add up to make the boot look a little less tidy than it could.</p> \n<p>All of that said, the other day I was waiting in line at an airport and I was admiring the pair of boots worn by a woman walking by. Turns out she was wearing <em>these very same boots</em>. Which I had on my feet at the time. So, maybe I’m being a little nitpicky about how I perceive that they appear.</p> \n<p>Overall they get incredibly high marks for comfort and utility (like, Pry Them From My Cold Dead Feet high marks, or maybe just Get Another Pair In Brown high marks). They will work nicely for tromping around in muddy fields, looking cute with dresses and warm leggings as well as walking for many more hours than you anticipated in an unfamiliar city in an attempt to find that specialty beer shop you read about.</p> \n<p>The Merrell Captiva Strap boots are available at <a href=\"http://www.zappos.com/merrell-captiva-strap-waterproof-black\">Zappos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NQGSIA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009NQGSIA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20\">Amazon</a> (affiliate link) in black and brown. I hover between a size 7 and 7.5 in shoes and I bought a size 7.5 in these, though the fit across the top of the foot has stretched and I occasionally wonder if the size 7 would have worked out as well.</p> \n<p>(One quick note: I usually look for shoes over at Zappos and use the “You May Also Like” suggestions to browse out further, which can take a while and lead to scores of open tabs. Just now over at Amazon I typed Merrell Captiva into the search and it showed me 25 results for boots of various brands, many of them had been contenders in my search last Autumn. If I’d know Amazon was so good at laying down focused options like that it would have saved me a bunch of time. This is something I’ll have to remember and test out next time I’m looking for shoes.)</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/EBs4uxqKnCo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 12:38:47 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jan/merrellcaptiva.jpg","linkMd5":"44011057e156109808c79b77e9ffd1a6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-15-639_2f06c6becd16fe68.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":336,"sourceBytes":13299,"destBytes":5748,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jan/merrellcaptiva.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-15-639_2f06c6becd16fe68.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/EBs4uxqKnCo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn3@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-22-065_ab7e696355ca9e51.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454787},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"Padron peppers, nature’s game of surprise","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=16732","description":"<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014july/padron1.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padr%C3%B3n_peppers\">Padrón peppers</a> are delicious and they are also like a little game of surprise – most of these are mild but ever fifth one is hot.

I don’t know if you’d get the same color results from a hard boiled egg, but I doubt you’d want to eat a hard boiled egg after it’s been introduced to this much food coloring.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/eastereggs/all.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Also note: The color amounts are subject to change because I’m still not quite happy with all of them and I didn’t yet have a chance to test dye everything one more time.

Reds and oranges turned out well, blues and purples were the most difficult to get right and tended to be the most blotchy or streaky.</p> \n<p>When using emptied eggshells like these stirrers or skewers are really the best way to lift the egg, a spoon will prove a lot more tricky.</p> \n<p>The colors will look very different under artificial lights, the neon colors will show a lot more and the reds will seem much more orange. It’s fascinating.</p> \n<p>Agitate the eggs about three times during the process, lifting them out of the water to disrupt bubbles that might form and make the final egg speckled. (Or don’t, it’s actually a cute look, but the egg will have a bare spot where it rests on the bottom of the dye container if you don’t move it at least a bit.)</p> \n<p>I have one more thing to add to my list of <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2012/05/01/why-jars-are-great-for-bringing-food-to-cookouts/\">why jars are ideal</a>.</p> \n<p>I went from soaking the eggs for 10 minutes to 25 minutes because the eggs I accidentally left too long turned out better.</p> \n<p>Ohmigosh. I <em>just now</em> noticed that there are egg dying charts on the back of the boxes of food coloring drops. What a palm-forehead moment. I don’t remember if I started with those charts way back when I did this the <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2010/04/01/easter-surprise-eggs-the-easy-version/\">first time</a>. Where those charts on the box back then? Did I not see them? Not trust them? Willfully ignore them? This year I started with my old notes and made changes from there. I see more egg dying in my future. (Somebody send help, I cannot seem to stop.)</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/zNZXyfc47gs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 23:47:49 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/eastereggs/eastereggs.jpg","linkMd5":"8a6199c2ac72b03b052496cf74441ffb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn14@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-15-414_8e34071e9c10c240.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":750,"sourceBytes":62745,"destBytes":15010,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/eastereggs/eastereggs.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn14@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-15-414_8e34071e9c10c240.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/eastereggs/foodcolorcontainers.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-22-039_92f047c762199ee7.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/eastereggs/soaking.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn43@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-24-817_d80cc160d248a7c1.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/eastereggs/drying.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-22-945_f928466197d1af8f.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/eastereggs/all.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-25-529_f2cdf746e5b45c8f.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/eastereggs/sixmain.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn65@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-20-347_03be6bc296f88093.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/zNZXyfc47gs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-20-911_2dc0389445c629da.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454787},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"15th Birthday","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=17709","description":"<p>This site is 15 years old today.

I asked for just the single pasta roller, none of the other cutter attachments, because my kitchen is tiny and I’m happy enough to cut my own noodles into wide strips. And if it comes down to something as thin as linguine I’m far more likely to used a boxed pasta anyhow.</p> \n<p>It is <em>so much fun</em> to make pasta but with all the flour being scattered about it’s worth making a whole lot of noodles at the same time. A little research tells me that freezing fresh pasta will preserve the flavor better than drying it and the best way to freeze it is in bundles or nests. </p> \n<p>Technique: Toss your just-made pasta with extra flour so it won’t stick together. Let it dry for a few minutes then fold and twist into bundles. Freeze those on a parchment lined baking sheet, then transfer to an airtight container. When you are ready to cook simply drop one bundle into boiling water, the noodles should separate from each other easily. Also, voilà, fresh homemade pasta appears before you like magic!</p> \n<p>Before I did nests I decided that individual pasta strands rolled up, frozen and stacked together would be charming. And they were, but obviously they stuck together like mad in the boiling water.

Look at how big they are! It’s shown here with a regular sized Kinder Surprise Egg for scale and a Mini Kinder Egg which I added because I happened to find them in a local shop.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/minikindereggs.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>The Mini Kinder Eggs are filed with hazelnut paste and bits of hazelnut. They are delicious and I recommend you grab some if you see them.</p> \n<p>If you’d like to see what was in my giant Kinder Surprise eggs click through for all the details.

The chocolate was a bit shinier and snappier than normal, much like the <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2013/12/09/kinder-surprise-egg-a-day-day-26/\">Kinder Santas</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant4.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>The capsule is <em>huge</em>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant5.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Here is the capsule next to a regular sized capsule.

The suitcases don’t snap shut though, which is a shame since I’d totally use them to store a little travel sewing kit or something.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant_boats1.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>The second giant egg held this fishing game. That blue pool is made to hold water, so the boats would be floating. I’m not sure if this is a game of speed? There weren’t any game rules included in the assembly instructions. I like the idea of lions fishing for human boats, it’s a bit sinister.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant_capsules.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>If you’re a Kinder Surprise nerd you might like to know that, yes, even the giant capsules come in different colors.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/ZSTPOG0hQ40\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 16 Apr 2014 21:27:19 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindereggs.jpg","linkMd5":"28daeaf26cbbc14f50a77420f1687c2a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-16-383_008f16c2283b9ccc.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":750,"sourceBytes":116156,"destBytes":49278,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindereggs.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-16-383_008f16c2283b9ccc.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/minikindereggs.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-21-622_b4694301667b7103.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-21-296_fbb2abfd9d6d767b.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-21-640_16e4d001ae1a2f23.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn15@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-21-698_03dfaacf7fd5f563.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant_cards1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn26@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-20-597_3e1337b9233938ba.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant_cards2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-22-486_d95a8f08d3bf8e40.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant_boats1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-24-316_79d577025357e5ff.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/kindersurprise/kindersurprisegiant_capsules.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-24-691_73442870eadd30d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/ZSTPOG0hQ40":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn47@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-27-881_d9c4abe6599c4630.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454785},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"links: food","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=17257","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.howtocookthat.net/public_html/rainbow-steam-cake-recipe/\">Rainbow Steam Cake Recipe – HowToCookThat</a>.

It was. Any time when I was a kid bored at a community picnic in a park? Instant treasure hunt. When I went to summer camp and my cabin was sent on a scavenger hunt that included a four-leaf clover? I had that covered. I was the Irish girl with an Irish name who could find four-leaf clovers. My fixation even got me a boyfriend in college. (He wrote a poem about it! It was true love except for the fact that it really, really wasn’t.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/irelandclover/church.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Before <a href=\"http://gomighty.com/\">Go Mighty</a> and the Life List I never really considered what things I wanted to do before I died except for this: as a kid I decided that one day I wanted to find a four-leaf clover in Ireland. And last November I did!</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/irelandclover/cloverme.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Last year Scott and I took a work/travel trip to the UK and Ireland. We only spent six days total in Ireland and on the second to last day I, ecstatically, found my four-leaf clover. It turns out that the urban parks, national monuments and historical locations in Ireland are <em>very</em> well tended — which means that patches of weeds (like clover) are not allowed to take over. So I felt that much more lucky to spy a four-leaf clover outside the Kilmalkeder Christian Site in Kerry, Ireland. According to the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1612386679/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1612386679&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20\">Rick Steves guide book</a> it was a Norman center of worship that became a 12th-century church where the old graveyard is rising spookily above the soil line while on the other side there are new gravestones being inscribed. We visited as the sun was setting on our second to last day in Ireland and I was beginning to fear I’d be leaving cloverless.</p> \n<p>I found a few four-leaf clovers in that precious patch and have them pressed inside a book. They aren’t the prettiest of clovers but they are my favorite because every time I see them middle school aged me is giddy.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/Hf3m3ciwc_4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 17:16:49 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/irelandclover/cloverchurch.jpg","linkMd5":"39cc18596dc789fc472dc959e93dde80","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-15-391_fb51e0d57a38071e.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":667,"sourceBytes":70352,"destBytes":36688,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/irelandclover/cloverchurch.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-15-391_fb51e0d57a38071e.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/irelandclover/church.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-24-212_9fdc2833df823b1e.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/irelandclover/cloverme.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-22-691_ce76e3608e3944ba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/Hf3m3ciwc_4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn56@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-04-20-961_01f5716bcfcd2671.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454786},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"links: halloween","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=17781","description":"<p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/trick-treat-artist-makes-spine-chilling-lifelike-halloween/story?id=43013461\">Trick or Treat!

And look! It only took me three years!</p> \n<p>I decided to imprint the tops with wood grain using a mat meant to imprint on clay, something I first spotted on <a href=\"http://www.marthastewart.com/990883/april-fools-day-jeff-daniels\">Martha Stewart</a> (video, there with Jeff Daniels on an April Fools episode). Doing a little research I found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0fjKngHTfA\">Haniela’s</a> (video) has also created these, and her instructions are wonderful. She’s got a lot of great videos for Halloween baked goods, check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdGMytlKLes\">Monster Eye Cake</a>.</p> \n<p>I bought my wood grain mat from a <a href=\"http://www.seattlepotterysupply.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?\">local pottery supply store</a>, it’s the wood grain mat sold by <a href=\"http://chineseclayart.com/ChineseClayArt/store_fd.asp\">Chinese Clay Art</a>.

Roll the dough between two layers of parchment paper, this will keep the chocolate cookies nice and dark. I have a tiny kitchen so I roll dough on my dining room table using a medium sized <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026JXIIE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0026JXIIE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=U7SKRYFM5XCBPKCB\">Roul’pat</a>.

I made these with two hollow layers in the middle, instead of the single layer from my original Trick or Treat Cookies, to allow for more room for candy. I used round cutters to cut out the insides because it was far easier than trying to trim out the middles and laziness ruled that day.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015oct/coffincookies/assembly_insides.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015oct/coffincookies/filling.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>I used dark chocolate candy melts to use as glue because it sets faster, but if you have the time real chocolate would taste better.

Wandering around Seattle Pottery Supply I saw a whole bunch of tools meant for fondant or baking and I was stunned by the amount of plunger cutters<br /> that allow you to make <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/wum3s-lM8c/?taken-by=notmartha\">teeny tiny cookies</a>.

Chill in the refrigerator for 3 hours or up to overnight.</p> \n <p>Roll the dough between two layers of parchment to 1/4″ thick.</p> \n <p>Bake cookies at 375 degrees for 5 to 8 minutes depending on the size. (The narrower center pieces will bake much faster.) </p>\n</ul> \n<p>This image is here for use on Pinterest.

Our living room has this cotton chenille shag rug for a few reasons: it wasn’t terribly expensive, it’s easy to clean (I’ve only spilled wine on it twice but both times the splatter was spectacular and far reaching) and it’s very comfortable to sprawl out on with laptops or game controllers. And most importantly it nicely covers a rug heater, which is glorious on cold nights.</p> \n<p>When we were looking for houses to buy our realtor seemed to have heated flooring on the brain because she suggested putting in heated floors in every other place we toured. When we moved in I looked into installing heated floors and, whoa, it’s expensive. So I did the next best thing and got an under rug heater. There are a few options out there and we went with the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YYAPV6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000YYAPV6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20\">SpeedHeat Rugbuddy</a> which we got from Amazon (affiliate link). It has made the last three winters much more cozy. We have an open plan area around the living room so I can’t tell if it heats the room up but I can say that after a while I’m warm enough to take off a sweater, especially if we’re camped out binge watching something or if we’re sitting on the floor playing a video game. I <em>love</em> it and have found myself recommending rug heaters to a lot of people this year.</p> \n<p>Some details: We have the 3’x5′ and it’s large enough for the area in front of a couch but I do wish we’d gone for a larger version. The mat will shift around under the rug as you scoot an ottoman or coffee table back and forth so do use rug tape the way the instructions recommend. I put a heatproof fabric between the heater and the room’s carpet (not needed, but I’m paranoid), I use the fabric that is sold to insulate ironing boards which I found at a local fabric store. The rug heater plugs into the wall (our cord is hidden under the couch) and has an on/off button. I cannot say with any certainty that it’s saved on heating bills, but I can say that we are much less likely to turn up the heat in the house if the area around the couch is warm. They come in in several sizes (up to 8’x11’!) and I’m considering getting this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YYVUMO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000YYVUMO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20\">3’x2′</a> mat for under my desk.</p> \n<p>I’m really, really glad we bought this. It’s seems silly but it makes me very happy.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/Vq2ZZX2mxiA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 12:57:10 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/heatedrug.jpg","linkMd5":"91835383456bdece73cbd6095c4f25d3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn37@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-16-130_5300c5e471e523ed.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":607,"sourceBytes":105018,"destBytes":33472,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/heatedrug.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn37@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-16-130_5300c5e471e523ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/Vq2ZZX2mxiA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-25-360_5c46a9eae70cf991.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454786},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"links: food","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=17809","description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-ina-gartens-parmesan-roasted-zucchini-237270\">Recipe: Ina Garten’s Parmesan Roasted Zucchini | The Kitchn</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.culinaryhill.com/saltine-cracker-candy/\">Christmas Crack | Culinary Hill</a>.

There was a cafe called Nervous Nellie’s (now closed) that offered coffee and interesting toast. There was cheese, and jam, and jam and cheese, and cheese and a red pepper relish. I tried the relish because I’d never heard of it and, quite shockingly honestly, I really liked it. A whole lot. It was savory and tangy and a nice change from the usual sweet breakfast offerings.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/toast/tjandcheese.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Nervous Nellies is closed now but I tracked down the ingredients to make the same style of toast. A bit of snooping around archived web pages and my old notes leave me believing that the ingredients I remember are Lappi cheese (a very mild cheese, havariti will work just as well), and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajvar\">Ajvar</a>, a red pepper spread.</p> \n<h3>To assemble</h3> \n<p>Add butter and a sprinkling of good salt to the toast, then slices of cheese and spread the Ajvar on top. The toppings are cold and creamy and a little spicy and tangy. I don’t think everybody will like Ajvar but I highly recommend giving it a try should you come across it.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/toast/jars.jpg\" /></p> \n<h3>Some notes</h3> \n<p>Nervous Nellie’s listed their red pepper relish as “Lutenica” on the menu but after doing a tasting of a few relishes I’m convinced that they were using something closer to Ajvar. At an imports store I found both hot and mild Ajvar as well as Pepptizer and Lutenica. They all looked similar with the exception of a few different ingredients. Clearly there had to be a taste test.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/toast/fourtypes.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Mild Ajvar</strong>: This is what I remember, it’s got a very mild heat. Mostly tangy and a little sweet, very fresh tasting. (Top left.)</p> \n<p><strong>Hot Ajvar</strong>: There is a extra zing of spiciness but no acid (no tomatoes). It’s a still a relatively gentle heat. (Top right.)</p> \n<p><strong>Lutenica</strong>: This one is more blended and looks more like a sauce than a relish. This is definitely not what I remember from the Nervous Nellie’s toast. It’s got more garlic and the taste of cooked tomatoes, and it doesn’t taste fresh. (Bottom left.)</p> \n<p><strong>Peppetizer</strong>: Too much onion and something tastes off, like stewed vegetables. Not what I’d want on toast. (Bottom right.)</p> \n<p>If you’re in Seattle and interested in sources: I tracked down Ajvar at <a href=\"http://www.bigjohnspfiseattle.com/\">Big John’s Pacific Foods Imports</a> in SODO and the Lappi cheese at <a href=\"http://www.scanspecialties.com/\">Scandinavian Specialties</a> in Ballard. This winter Trader Joe’s had a red pepper relish that I suspect is the Zergut brand with a TJs label and last time I was in the store they still had a number of jars available. (I had the opportunity to ask a TJs employee and he said it was almost certainly one of those seasonal items that they won’t be stocking again after the run is sold out.) <strong>Update:</strong> mims mentioned in the comments below that the red pepper spread carried by Trader Joe’s is actually a year round product, and sure enough it’s been there on the shelves every time I’ve checked for it. It’s stocked down near the floor and easy to overlook, look for it and give it a try!</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/iiq_laMyHpo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 00:05:25 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/toast/toast.jpg","linkMd5":"14b692266fcb12dcf82e827b84dcfdec","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn41@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-15-981_0e6daa4104046b58.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":750,"sourceBytes":89894,"destBytes":27924,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/toast/toast.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn41@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-15-981_0e6daa4104046b58.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/toast/tjandcheese.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-22-752_7e07047fa61fe509.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/toast/jars.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn67@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-23-695_c517c4b99fdbdcd1.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014apr/toast/fourtypes.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn48@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-24-879_5bfffe46cb6ecf54.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/iiq_laMyHpo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-23-060_ee60ec84653ad1ad.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454785},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"Tiny Gingerbread House decorations","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=16959","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.brit.co/shop/catalog/holiday-mug-and-gingerbread-house-kit_27384/?utm_source=other&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=britkitcollabs\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014nov/gingerbreadhouses/sprinkles500vert.jpg\" /></a></p> \n<p>Here are the decorations I’ve collected to decorate the <a href=\"\">tiny gingerbread houses that decorate mugs</a> which I’ll be making this year. The houses are so small that decorations to be sprinkled on are all you need. I tend to keep an eye out for holiday worthy sprinkles and decorations all year long, so some of these might have had me contemplating the holidays in the middle of July.</p> \n<p><strong>Crushed candy canes</strong> – Easy, colorful and festive. Also, candy canes are easy to find at the corner store or, say, in the lobby of your bank so you don’t need to make a special trip to find sprinkles. (If you use the pre-crushed sort I promise I won’t tell.)</p> \n<p><strong>Nonpareils</strong> – Tiny and crunchy and if you get one of those containers with sections for six different colors you can create your own color mix.</p> \n<p><strong>Sugar pearls</strong> – These are like giant nonpareils, I found these at a discount store.</p> \n<p><strong>Itty bitty edible gold foil stars</strong> – <em>Itty bitty edible gold stars!</em> These are amazingly cute. I’ve found these sold by Wilton in the baking aisles of Michael’s and Joann stores as well as specialty cooking shops.</p> \n<p><strong>Gold dragée</strong> – I want more gold in my holidays so I was thrilled when I found these. Unlike their silver counterparts these are safe to eat since they’re made using edible metallic dust.</p> \n<p><strong>Oversized sprinkles</strong> – Colorful like twinkle lights. These are from Wilton and they make me very happy.</p> \n<p>The next three options are great for creating a simple snowy roof:</p> \n<p><strong>White nonpareils</strong> – I like the details of a sweet covering of precious little snowy white balls.</p> \n<p><strong>Sanding sugar</strong> – The larger sugar crystals sparkle nicely.</p> \n<p><strong>Edible glitter</strong> – I bought this at a specialty cake supply store where the owner assured me that the edible glitter is the best for reflecting the sparkle from twinkle lights. I’ve done a terrible job at conveying that in this photo.</p> \n<p>The last row are all from a decoration set that came in one container.</p> \n<p><strong>Holly leaves and berries</strong> – Sweetly festive.</p> \n<p><strong>Tiny snowflakes</strong> – You can place these individually if you want, or just sprinkle them on and let randomness do it’s job.</p> \n<p><strong>Tiny candy canes</strong> – Much to my dismay they don’t actually taste of peppermint, but all is forgiven because they are terribly cute.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.brit.co/shop/catalog/holiday-mug-and-gingerbread-house-kit_27384/?utm_source=other&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=britkitcollabs\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014nov/gingerbreadhouses/houseconstruction500b.jpg\" /></a></p> \n<p>Don’t forget!

You see, I love Liege style waffles so much that I basically dedicated an <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2013/10/21/eat-a-liege-style-waffle-in-belgium-check/\">entire weekend to eating them in Belgium</a> but I had to figure out a way to make my own at home that ultimately involved as little work as possible on a weekend morning.</p> \n<p>Spoiler: we froze them.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/closeup2.jpg\" /><br /> <em>The shiny bits are sugar that has melted and covered the outside. It’s a crunchy, candy coated waffle. It’s excellent.</em></p> \n<p>I tested a few ways to get the waffle from the freezer to my mouth quickly while still keeping as many of the desirable features as possible intact. Those desirable features are: delightfully crackly sugar coated exterior, steamy yeasted layers inside, and overwhelming sense of all being right with the universe.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/inside.jpg\" /><br /> <em>Between the carefully nurtured yeast and the pockets of melted sugar the inside of the waffle has some delightful layers.</em></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://liegewaffle.wordpress.com/liege-waffle-recipe-liege-gaufre-recette-metric/\">recipe</a> from a site conveniently located at liegewaffle.wordpress.com is outstanding, it is perfection for the home waffle maker really, and got thumbs up from friends who also have fond location-specific waffle memories. The recipe takes a number of hours spread over two days and while it’s definitely <em>A Project</em> it’s a project I’ll happily take on.</p> \n<p>The trouble is that it calls for a last 90-minute rise before putting the dough on the waffle iron which, to be honest, isn’t how I want to find myself eating the waffles. Which <em>ideally</em> is about ten minutes after I’ve woken up on a Saturday morning. And so, here is what we tested, including a few deliveries to willing friends who reported back with great information:</p> \n<h3>Idea #1</h3> \n<p> Freeze the dough directly after the last rise and later waffle it right out of the freezer. Downside: still a little bit of work to do upon waking up, waffle iron to wash. Upside: makes the kitchen smell amazing. Result: while the exterior of our waffles were very satisfying the interiors showed signs of not quite being cooked all the way through, the dough was a little mushier than it should have been. Not unpleasantly so, mind you, just not the best.</p> \n<h3>Idea #2</h3> \n<p> <em>The Winner.</em> Fully cook the waffle and freeze it. Downside: it’s just not as magical to simply defrost something. Upside: no waffle iron to wash later that day and makes frozen waffles giftable. Result: this is my pick for the way to go. The waffles were a bit chewier than just-cooked and never-frozen Liege waffles but an acceptable alternative which retained all the crunchy candy shell, yeasty goodness and feelings of universal ok-ness that were required. Heat in the oven at 275 degrees for 6 to 8 minutes (more on this below). I was honestly surprised that this worked out better than cooking frozen dough in the morning, pleased though because you can take a batch of ready-to-go frozen waffles to a friend with the reheating instructions.</p> \n<h3>Idea #3</h3> \n<p> Do some parbaking, or parwaffling if you will, and cook the waffles just to the golden stage, then freeze. In the morning take the formed waffles and put them back on the waffle iron and finish cooking them. Downside: you’ll end up washing the waffle iron twice. Upside: as it turns out, nothing. The texture of the waffle was the worst of the three trials. Result: it was a fun experiment but skip it.</p> \n<p>I don’t want to take away from my aforementioned opinion of perfection for the <a href=\"https://liegewaffle.wordpress.com/liege-waffle-recipe-liege-gaufre-recette-metric/\">Liege Waffle recipe</a> that I used but considering my impatience-based needs I did make a few changes. Since all of the early tests produced overly chewy and too dense waffles I switched from bread flour to all-purpose flour. Since I was intending to freeze them I doubled the recipe and I also adjusted the amount of dough allowed to each waffle (basically from ten waffles to twelve waffles).</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/sugarhand.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/sugarlars.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong>A note on pearl sugar:</strong> If you only have the energy to fuss over one thing with this recipe I suggest you fuss over getting the right sort of sugar. The <a href=\"http://www.larsown.com/\">Lars’ Own</a> brand Belgian Pearl Sugar shown here can be found in grocery stores or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LDAE4C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001LDAE4C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=AS4XQMB5MGLMP4ZZ\">ordered online</a> (you’ll need two boxes, or just over 10 ounces total). (Also note: affiliate links.) If you’re in Seattle I’ve found Lars’ brand Belgian pearl sugar for sale in Metropolitan Markets and Red Apple Markets and it’s sold in bulk at <a href=\"http://www.bigjohnspfi.com/\">Big John’s PFI</a>. (Thanks for that tip, <a href=\"http://www.thegastrognome.com/\">Gastrognome</a>!)</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/secondrisediag1.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong>A note on the time you’ll need to allow:</strong> This recipe includes some long stretches of letting the dough rise so I’ve called out the waiting times in the recipe below. The first day of work will need at least 6 and a half hours (most of this is waiting time) before you get the dough tucked into the fridge for an overnight rest so plan accordingly and don’t start this recipe in the evening.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/secondrisediag2.jpg\" /><br /> <em>Four hours later.</em></p> \n<p><strong>A note on protein content in the flour I used:</strong> I made my first three test batches with the <a href=\"http://www.kingarthurflour.com/flours/\">King Arthur</a> Bread Flour called for in the original recipe and found that our freshly made waffles were a bit more dense than the waffles we ate in Belgium, but our frozen waffles were very chewy. Too chewy. I switched to King Arthur All-Purpose Flour and while the frozen waffles were still a bit chewier than are ideal it was far closer to the waffles we remembered. King Arthur flours have a <a href=\"https://www.kingarthurflour.com/about/documents/5Flours_000.pdf\">less than .2% protein difference</a> between batches, their bread flour is 12.7% and their all-purpose flour is 11.7%, which is pretty high. Most brands of all-purpose flour fall near 10.5% so if you’re using a different brand you might consider subbing in a small amount of bread flour to boost the gluten amount.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/cooking.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong>A note on the waffle iron:</strong> I bought myself a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W4UE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004W4UE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=UFZ7M7BF6GSBLD5N\">stovetop</a> waffle iron specifically because I wanted something that would be easy to clean. (Conveniently it also takes up less storage space in my tiny kitchen.) Friends who have made Liege style waffles report back that cleaning up after making them in an electric iron isn’t too much work, any sugar that melts out will harden when it’s cool and your waffle iron won’t be much harder to clean than usual. I bought the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W4UE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004W4UE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=UFZ7M7BF6GSBLD5N\">NordicWare stovetop waffle iron</a> that is nonstick and made of cast aluminum but I’ve also had my eye on a cast iron stovetop waffle maker sold by <a href=\"http://waffleburger.com/\">Waffleburger</a> (scroll down). I’ll report back if I get my hands on the cast iron one.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/tools.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><strong>A note on the thermometer:</strong> Since I am, as you might have noticed, a little bit obsessed with getting these waffles right I found that an infrared thermometer was essential in getting the temperature of the waffle iron to the correct range. I bought a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00377BSU4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00377BSU4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=notmartha-20&amp;linkId=O3P5MDSCGJSJ7QZX\">midpriced one</a> (it’s nicely sturdy) at a hardware store and it’s worked great. It’s also really handy when you temperature of things around you house to try to figure out why your bedroom always seems ten degrees colder than the rest of the house.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/rising1.jpg\" /><br /> <em>This is step #3, its pretty dramatic.</em></p> \n<h3>Liege Waffles for Freezing</h3> \n<p>Recipe adapted from the <a href=\"https://liegewaffle.wordpress.com/\">Gaufre de Liège Recette Blog</a>, which is excellent.</p> \n<p>Makes 12 waffles.</p> \n<h3>Ingredients</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>3 tsp.

(40 g) light brown sugar</li> \n <li>1 1/2 tsp. (9 g) salt</li> \n <li>17 Tbsp. (240 g) room temperature butter (just over two sticks)</li> \n <li>2 Tbsp. (30 g) honey</li> \n <li>4 tsp. (20 ml) vanilla extract</li> \n <li>1 1/2 cup (300 g) Belgian Pearl Sugar</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Directions</h3> \n<p><strong>1.</strong> Put heated milk and water in the bowl of a stand mixer, sprinkle yeast over the top and stir to moisten.</p> \n<p><strong>2.</strong> Add the eggs and about 1/3rd (160 g) of the flour, mix to blend.</p> \n<p><strong>3.</strong> Sprinkle the remaining flour over the top of the mixture but don’t stir it in. Cover the bowl and let it stand for 75 to 90 minutes at room temperature. You’ll see the yeast mixture bubble up through the flour.</p> \n<p><em>after 90 minutes</em></p> \n<p><strong>4.</strong> Add the brown sugar and salt, mix on slow to combine everything in the bowl. (I just go ahead and use the dough hook.)</p> \n<p><strong>5.</strong> With your mixer on low speed add the honey and the vanilla. Add 2 Tbsp. (60 g) of butter at a time. Mix everything for 4 minutes at medium-low speed, scrape down sides a few times. Let the dough rest for 1 minute and mix again for 2 minutes. Do this again a few times until the dough starts to want to stick mostly to the dough hook.</p> \n<p><strong>6.</strong> Transfer the dough into a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let this rise at room temperature for 4 hours.</p> \n<p><em>after 4 hours</em></p> \n<p><strong>7.</strong> Refrigerate for 30 minutes. This step is for yeast respiration, it will slow it down which you’ll need to do before the next step.</p> \n<p><em>after 30 minutes</em></p> \n<p><strong>8.</strong> Using a silicone spatula press down on the dough to deflate it. Scrap this onto a piece of plastic wrap, stretch into a long rectangle and then fold into thirds. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and weight it down with dinner plates. Refrigerate overnight.</p> \n<p><em>after an overnight rest</em></p> \n<p><strong>9.</strong> Divide your pearl sugar in 12 equal piles, about 2 Tbsp. (25 g) each. Divide the dough into 12 pieces (about 88 g each). Mix the pearl sugar into each part of dough, I usually flatten the dough, sprinkle sugar on top and fold it over a few times.</p> \n<p><strong>10.</strong> Shape each waffle into an oval lump, cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for 90 minutes.</p> \n<p><em>after 90 minutes</em></p> \n<p><strong>11.</strong> Spray your waffle iron with cooking spray. Heat until it registers at 365-370 degrees F (185 – 187 C). (Hotter than this and it will burn the sugar.) Cook until the waffle is dark golden brown and you can see the sugar melting and coating the outside. If you’re using a stovetop waffle iron I recommend turning it over every 90 seconds or so to keep the temperature on both sides up and allow for as much sugar to coat the exterior as possible. Carefully transfer the waffles to a wire rack to cool — be aware that the hot sugar will drip and can burn your fingers (ask me how I know) so use tongs and a flat spatula or small plate to help you move them. When cool tuck each waffle into some parchment paper and freeze in an airtight container. When you are ready to cook them preheat an oven to 275 degrees F and place the waffle directly onto the wire rack. Heat for 5 to 7 minutes, carefully transfer to a plate, maybe line the plate with that strip of parchment paper.</p> \n<p>I recommend the oven over a reheating in a toaster because I don’t want hot sugar to drip into your toaster. A friend reported that even at the lowest heat setting the waffles burned in her toaster oven. So, regular oven it is.</p> \n<p><strong>12.</strong> <em>If you are freezing the dough to cook later</em>: Transfer the sheet with your dough directly into the freezer and let the dough chill for at least half an hour until set. Wrap each lump of dough in plastic wrap and place together in an airtight container in the freezer. When you are ready to cook follow the directions above for cooking. I remove as many ovals of dough as I want to make and place them onto the hot waffle iron, pressing the iron down slowly to flatten them out as they thaw. If you freeze the dough on parchment you can cut around them and use that parchment when you wrap them up, it will peel off cleanly before putting them in the waffle iron.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/freezelump2.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/freezelump3.jpg\" /></p> \n<h3>Enjoy!</h3> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/stack_detail.jpg\" /></p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/3NT_uxjguFs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 17:49:42 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/stack7.jpg","linkMd5":"30a9f73b780d1bdcd4715d699749dc37","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-15-401_c446e5cc40a4d7f1.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":750,"sourceBytes":72977,"destBytes":24906,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/stack7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-15-401_c446e5cc40a4d7f1.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/closeup2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-26-247_79940cb947280843.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/inside.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn56@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-23-570_fbafa04ca43d37ce.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/sugarhand.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-22-112_c94a14eeb2fb8cf4.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/sugarlars.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn13@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-20-225_20bc93015ef39123.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/secondrisediag1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn88@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-23-111_069e06c269b31e12.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/secondrisediag2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-25-255_6b006652733f46e8.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/cooking.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn93@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-20-308_9a10f9fb21052c6a.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/tools.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-25-847_7be2346c3306a99a.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/rising1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-25-168_d09c49137fb1d7ba.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/freezelump2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-22-029_1bff2e8ebdf0a983.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/freezelump3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-21-642_d4790e9bed734e0c.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2015mar/liegewaffles/stack_detail.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-23-460_339e5a0dff0d78cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/3NT_uxjguFs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-22-800_9a56fdc8b1d15621.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454779},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"iPad games that will keep you warm during the soggy end of winter","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=16282","description":"<p>Here are the games that I’ve been playing on my iPad which have been keeping me distracted from the cold, wet darkness of winter.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-inferno-hd/id590250573?mt=8\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/ipadgames/littleinferno.jpg\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-inferno-hd/id590250573?mt=8\">Little Inferno</a></p> \n<p>In this game you burn things. Toys and bricks and food and batteries and planets. For everything you burn you build up credit to buy more things to burn, which you order from catalogs. There is a plot that unfolds as you progress in the form of notes from your neighbor and updates from the weatherman as you cower indoors. This game is a criticism on video games and it skewers the way that modern games get you to obsessively play against odds and (spoiler alert) ultimately chides you for wasting your time playing this game. That said, I enjoyed every moment. The fire sound effects are soothing, each thing you burn has a different aspect or reaction (some scream, some explode) and it remains amusing throughout. The graphics are all lovingly created fun to toss around. You get a bonus when you burn things together from a pun-tastic list you can check off when you guess what “Duck Season” or “Nuclear Shave” means, which adds an extra completionist layer and will have you looking back through old objects to find a match.</p> \n<p>This game manages to be simple fun while having you looking extra hard to find a deeper story, and you won’t be disappointed. The humor and a few subjects inside are not for young children. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-inferno-hd/id590250573?mt=8\">$4.99</a> in the App Store, see more at the <a href=\"http://tomorrowcorporation.com/littleinferno\">Tomorrow Corporation</a> website.

It starts without any guidance on how to play or where you are or what you are doing, all things you’ll uncover as you progress. It’s graphics and spooky atmosphere had me continue to poke around instead of giving up in frustration. The first time I played it I was on a plane and the guy next to me made a point to ask what I was playing, it really is that pretty.</p> \n<p>One of the first objects you encounter doesn’t end up being used in the completion of the game but it does tie into the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/year-walk-companion/id597879895?mt=8\">Companion</a> game ,which is easy to simply not know about. The companion game is short but adds some explanation and depth to the original story and it, apparently, wasn’t released for a good long time after the main game which was a very interesting move.</p> \n<p>This game deals with murder and ghost horses and dead babies and is really, really not for the young. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/year-walk/id555916407?mt=8\">$3.99</a> in the App Store, Year Walk Companion is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/year-walk-companion/id597879895?mt=8\">free</a>. Year Walk will also be available on Steam soon, see the <a href=\"http://yearwalk.com/\">Year Walk</a> website.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tengami/id794960248?mt=8\"><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014mar/ipadgames/tengami.jpg\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tengami/id794960248?mt=8\">Tengami</a></p> \n<p>This is a recent addition to the app store but I’d had a preview of it last year at the <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2013/09/20/games-shown-at-the-seattle-indies-expo/\">Seattle Indies Expo</a>. The graphic in this game are all inspired by origami and in the game you actually unfold objects to go deeper, it’s a fresh and intuative and frankly gorgeous form of gameplay. That said the unhappy reviews of this game focus on the fact that it’s short, which is true (but it’s worth the price) and slow, also true but the only aspect I had a problem with. Your character moves from location to location at a fairly slow pace and the first time you run through a new land it’s great to have a chance to look around and admire the origami landscape. When you backtrack to solve a try something it takes a little patience, when you have to go back for the eighth time to move something into another position in the midst of solving a puzzle you get downright impatient. A form of double-click-to-run option would solve all this and in the end it’s a trivial complaint in the midst of a deeply beautiful game. Available in the App Store now, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tengami/id794960248?mt=8\">$4.99</a>, pre-order for OS X and Windows is on now.

Everything is hand drawn in a charming cartoon style and it’s set in a completely different world which is underground and dying out and guess what? That’s right! Your character is unwittingly set on the path to save it. I’ve loved this style of game since King’s Quest 1 and a thoroughly enjoyed this game, the gather-and-combine puzzles aren’t too obvious and aren’t too incomprehensible, the conversations with characters are funny (and skippable if you find yourself asking the same question), the world is quirky and unexpected. It’s a bit of a slower pace than (affect a “kids these days” tone of voice here) games these days but I loved it and played it in short bits as a sort of bedtime story for myself. There isn’t much objectionable in this game (it’s Despicable Me type grown up inside joke humor) but it probably won’t interest younger kids. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-inner-world/id634885478?mt=8\">$0.99</a> in the App store.

The <a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/HamptonCourtPalace/maze\">Hampton Court Maze</a> isn’t the largest hedge maze in the UK but it is the first one planted in Great Britain, dating from 1690. It’s also reportedly the most famous hedge maze so we figured it would do nicely. Being iconic means that the actual layout of the maze is depicted everywhere even on the sign at the entrance to the maze and, I think, printed on our tickets. We tried not to study it too closely, I mean, spoilers. If you want to see an overhead photograph of the maze there is a good one halfway down <a href=\"http://editorialeyes.net/2012/08/31/crape-black-and-half-mourning-a-review-of-the-pigeon-pie-mystery-by-julia-stuart/\">this page</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/mazetop.jpg\" /><br /> <em>This photo was taken by standing on tippy toe and pointing my camera out towards the center of the maze. Meaning, the hedges were taller than they seem in photos.</em></p> \n<p>In the off season the gardens surrounding Hampton Court are free to explore but the maze itself is about £5. Currently the maze page says there is a sound installation but we heard nothing and didn’t see any evidence of speakers so the off-season tickets might not include it, or we were there on day when it wasn’t working.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/mazecorridor.jpg\" /><br /> <em>That tree seemed so far away while we were in the maze.</em></p> \n<p>We were there in the off season and during a weekday which meant there weren’t many people in the maze so we had whole stretches of time where we could almost feel alone and lost. It was awesome.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/mazecenter.jpg\" /><br /> <em>We reached the center!</em></p> \n<p>The maze itself doesn’t seem very large from the outside, it covers 1/3rd of an acre and has 1/2 mile of trails inside, but it feels far larger inside. Like magic. Most of the paths are long straight stretches that end in an almost u-turn, which is disorienting. We were there to enjoy being inside the maze though, so we sought out every dead end and checked around every corner and when we found the end of the maze we turned around and found our way back to the entrance just because we wanted to spend as much time as possible inside.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_trees.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>It was, happily, a sunny day so we spent a few hours wandering around the gardens. The most decorative part of the gardens was closed because there was a film crew using it. We couldn’t really complain because they gardens were free.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_filming.jpg\" /><br /> <em>In the center there you can see famous people. Supposedly.</em></p> \n<p>We saw a lot of filming going on in Dublin and London while we were there. <a href=\"http://www.scottandrew.com\">Scott</a> works for a company that gathers movie and tv facts so we kept approaching the guards who were there to keep people like us out and asking, all innocent like, what they were filming. Our secret hope was that they would give us the code name that studios often use to make something sound as boring as possible when in fact Big Stars filming an alley scene for the Next Exciting Huge Thing are just beyond the barriers. To our disappointment all of the guards we talked to were very friendly, apologized that they couldn’t let us get any closer and then excitedly told us all about what was being filmed and which huge stars were right over there. In this case the production was an upcoming movie (tv special?) about Stephen Hawking and the two guards helpfully pointed out that if we stood just here we might capture a glimpse of somebody famous whose name I didn’t write down (sorry). They were young and excited to be working in the industry, it was so adorable I forgave them for ruining our game of being media sleuths.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_cones.jpg\" /><br /> <em>Early version of Cones of Dunshire? Or just the half of the decorative gardens that weren’t closed for filming?</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/HamptonCourtPalace/Default.aspx\">Hampton Court</a> is a quick train ride from London, unless you are us in which case all the train schedules have been shuffled and instead it will be a strange hour and a half of fiddling with incomprehensible train schedules on your phone while desperately hoping you’re on the correct platform. The train schedules might helpfully suggest you go to a further train station and take a bus, but don’t listen to it! The closer train station is a very doable walk over a bridge and onto the grounds. The court itself looks like it’s well worth the ticket price to get to look around inside but we were there with a purpose: hedge maze and then back to London for fancy dinner reservations.</p> \n<p>In the off season the gardens are free to wander but the maze itself is about £5. Even if you don’t have tickets to tour the court there are a few rooms you can access that have exhibits about the history of the gardens and the maze. There is also a gift shop and, I think, a cafe.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_ghost.jpg\" /><br /> <em>There were statues in the decorative gardens all wrapped up. It was incredibly creepy.</em></p> \n<p>I had grand plans of visiting more hedge mazes in England while we were there but from the moment the airplane landed both Scott and myself came down with some a form of head cold that was determined to be the most torturous and the least friendly to getting sleep. So when we were stationed in Bristol for a few weeks I had intended to take a few day trips by springing out of bed and catching a very early train so I could wander a maze, have lunch and be back in time for a relaxing dinner. Instead I spent my days sleeping in because there was no other choice, I needed rest. We had hiking and drinking to do in Scotland and Ireland after all! Seriously though, I was convinced I had pneumonia and was close to checking out how the free healthcare works. For the record, I have not come down with a cold in the many months since we returned from our trip so whatever we survived covered all forms of viruses that swept through the US last winter. How do I train myself to catch and fight all the viruses <em>before</em> my next trip?</p> \n<p>Hampton Court Maze and gardens are a perfect side trip from London. A little being outdoors and a bit of puzzle solving and you can be back in time for fancy dinner reservations.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/Ex_6HY934jk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 20:25:36 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_building.jpg","linkMd5":"171466b3625d7d43e0d414e19b9be4ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn91@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-15-561_687fa26a3562f96f.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":375,"sourceBytes":60103,"destBytes":27208,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_building.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn91@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-15-561_687fa26a3562f96f.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/mazetop.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn59@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-25-001_307435bbf96ffaa3.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/mazecorridor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-22-931_f3761ba63bc7a885.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/mazecenter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-04-21-973_9d8ca46e11fa0465.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_trees.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn51@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-23-280_fa6dae159ce53b88.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_filming.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn33@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-20-094_710d42f79715c271.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_cones.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn64@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-04-25-803_49afae290efbbe9c.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014jun/hedgemaze/gardens_ghost.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-04-21-363_df25d372ef8054bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/Ex_6HY934jk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-22-168_cdd1a6b886853f4c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454783},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"links: food","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=16543","description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/the-food-lab-how-to-make-grilled-stuffed-flank-steak-pinwheels.html?ref=pop_serious_eats\">The Food Lab: How to Make Grilled Stuffed Flank Steak Pinwheels | Serious Eats</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/stainless-steel-branch-skewers-set-of-2\">Stainless Steel Branch Skewers | UncommonGoods</a>.

I also have a few more personal requirements: no wool (I’m allergic) and no extraneous buckles/straps/flaps that I will only manage to catch on everything. This combination of things were surprisingly difficult to find for a while and at one point I ordered ten possible coats online and tried them on one after another at home. Some were too fussy, too heavy, too narrow in the hips and some were terribly tight up under the arms (what’s up with that Michael Kors?). At the time I overlooked the coat I’m about to tell you about because honestly, the photos online make it look more shiny and flimsy than it is in person and they never seem to have it in the stores to check out in person.</p> \n<p>The Eddie Bauer <a href=\"http://www.eddiebauer.com/product/girl-on-the-go-reg--trench-coat/20612683/_/A-ebSku_0067345720000060__20612683_catalog10002_en__US?showProducts=&amp;backToCat=Outerwear&amp;previousPage=GNAV&amp;tab=women&amp;dcolor=512\">Girl on the Go® Trench Coat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eddiebauer.com/product/girl-on-the-go-reg--insulated-trench-coat/20612671/_/A-ebSku_0067347512000070__20612671_catalog10002_en__US?showProducts=&amp;backToCat=Outerwear&amp;previousPage=GNAV&amp;tab=women&amp;dcolor=246\">Girl On The Go® Insulated Trench Coat</a> filled the raincoat shaped hole in my life. I brought the insulated version with me on a trip to the UK in Oct. and Nov. of last year and I was never cold or wet, the coat could be crammed into my suitcase and emerge looking just fine and I like to think I didn’t stick out too much as a tourist.</p> \n<p>The petite size manages to give me some shape and, miraculously, still fits over my not insignificant hips when I’m wearing my bulkiest sweater. I have both the regular and insulted version of the coat. The insulated liner has full sleeves, buttons out when you don’t need it and is surprisingly warm — in fact I was too warm when descending to Tube stations in London. (So, this could be a downside if you live in a city with a subway.) The only difference between the regular and insulated versions is that the waist is cut in a bit tighter in the regular version and it’s more flattering. Which is why I kept both versions. Because vanity. These coats are perfect for the Seattle climate and they both get a lot of use throughout the year so I have no regrets. I have the coat in black but the putty color, shown above, was tempting.</p> \n<p>Things that are not so great:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>it is all synthetic fabrics so it does make scratchy/swishy noises when you move, it doesn’t bother me (crinkle noises are insignificant when rain is pelting the side of your head) but I’ve known a few people for whom this is a peeve so I’ll mention it</li> \n <li>the hood detaches but it doesn’t tuck into the collar so you just have to keep track of it</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Things that are great:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>interior chest pocket that will hold an iPhone, the pocket sits low enough so that it hits, thankfully, underneath my boob</li> \n <li>hood cinches down</li> \n <li>no velcro</li> \n <li>zips from the bottom as well as the top</li> \n <li>snaps shut as well for those times when you’re just popping out to grab the mail and don’t want to fuss with zippers</li> \n <li>can be balled up and shoved in a bag and won’t wrinkle</li> \n <li>without the insulated liner the coat is surprisingly lightweight so it’s not too much trouble to carry with you shoved in your bag for the day</li> \n <li>the petite size fits a petite (but not necessarily skinny) frame well with room for a warm sweater </li>\n</ul> \n<p>I will also point to the <a href=\"http://www.eddiebauer.com/product/mackenzie-trench-coat/20612272/_/A-ebSku_0063973236000070__20612272_catalog10002_en__US?showProducts=&amp;backToCat=Outerwear&amp;previousPage=GNAV&amp;tab=women&amp;dcolor=707\">MacKenzie Trench Coat</a>, shown above right.

This makes it impractical to keep a lot of fresh food in our fridge (cleaning it out got depressing, so many unidentifiable items) so we tend to pick something up to cook earlier in the same day. To make it even easier I’ve been figuring out what half-prepared foods to keep in the freezer. For whatever reason if I made something complete (say lasagna) and freeze it we never seem to actually eat it, we prefer to make something we are craving so having components that will cut down on dirty dishes and chopping time have been making a big difference. It nearly makes me feel like I’m qualified to be an adult.</p> \n<p>I’ve mentioned a few things I keep in the freezer before — <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2009/06/12/how-to-blanch-and-freeze-kale/\">kale</a>, <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2009/06/23/freezing-bacon/\">bacon</a> layered so it’s easy to just grab a few slices, <a href=\"http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2009/06/10/bolognese-sauce/\">bolognese sauce</a> — and the latest staple I’ve added is caramelized onions. I use the recipe from <a href=\"http://www.teaandcookiesblog.com/2009/03/bacon-of-the-vegetarian-world.html\">Tea and Cookies</a> which mostly calls for “time, patience, and faith” which isn’t an exaggeration. The first time I caramelized onions I had to restrain myself from them off the stove too early. They need to be nice and dark:</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/caramelizedonions/teaandcookiesonions2.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><em>Image by Tara Austen Weaver, <a href=\"http://www.teaandcookiesblog.com/2009/03/bacon-of-the-vegetarian-world.html\">Tea and Cookies</a>.</em></p> \n<p>Basic technique: two sliced onions in a 10-inch pan, 1/4 cup olive oil, medium high heat, stirring every five minutes and patience. It will take about 30 minutes. For a more detailed description go <a href=\"http://www.teaandcookiesblog.com/2009/03/bacon-of-the-vegetarian-world.html\">read the entry at Tea and Cookies</a> and follow her tip about slicing bits a little thicker than others. I let these cool, put them in ziplock bags pressed flat and freeze them. Then I break off a tablespoon or so as I need it.</p> \n<p>So far we’ve mostly been using them in egg dishes. For the omlette pictured above I used mushrooms, spinach and goat cheese left over from a salad with some of the caramelized onions to create a way more delicious breakfast than I usually have. Tara describes caramelized onions as the bacon of the vegetarian world, they are smoky and salty and add a hit of flavor whatever you add it to. And people, yum. Also, having them on hand will make you feel like a genius.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/Z9SDV8WEMbI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 21:08:46 +0000","feedId":10758,"bgimg":"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/caramelizedonions/caramelizedonions.jpg","linkMd5":"e0fe2934505430c31e34d27c4d192c2d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-16-072_e10bbb5a7d407255.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":333,"sourceBytes":58364,"destBytes":19930,"author":"megan","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/caramelizedonions/caramelizedonions.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-16-072_e10bbb5a7d407255.webp","http://www.notmartha.org/images/other/2014feb/caramelizedonions/teaandcookiesonions2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-04-21-298_b3e2e97ed622b9bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/notmartha/~4/Z9SDV8WEMbI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-04-23-404_813fb16d7255916d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317454786},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:04:14","title":"links: food","link":"http://www.notmartha.org/?p=16272","description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/02/vegan-crispy-smoked-mushroom-bacon.html\">Vegan: Crispy Smoked Mushroom “Bacon” | Serious Eats</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://eater.com/archives/2014/03/05/here-are-the-milk-cookie-shots-dominique-ansel-will-debut-at-sxsw.php\">Dominique Ansel to Debut Milk &amp; Cookie Shots at SXSW – Eater</a>.
