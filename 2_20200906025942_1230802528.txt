At least, that's the theory. (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/editorial-images\">Getty Images</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Since 1980, the University of Tennessee's <a href=\"https://fac.utk.edu/collections-and-research/\">Forensic Anthropology Center</a> has plumbed the depths of the most macabre of sciences: the decomposition of human bodies. Known colloquially as the Body Farm, here scientists examine how donated cadavers decay, like how the microbiomes inside us go haywire after death. That microbial activity leads to bloat, and—eventually—a body will puncture. Out flows a rank fluid of nutrients, especially nitrogen, for plants on the Body Farm to subsume.</p>\n<p>That gave a group of University of Tennessee, Knoxville researchers an idea: what if that blast of nutrients actually changes the color and reflectance of a tree's leaves? And, if so, what if law enforcement authorities could use a drone to scan a forest, looking for these changes to find deceased missing people? Today in the journal Trends in Plant Science, researchers are formally floating the idea—which, to be clear, is still theoretical. The researchers are just beginning to study how a plant's phenotype—its physical characteristics—might change if a human body is composing nearby. \"What we're proposing is to use plants as indicators of human decomposition, to hopefully be able to use individual trees within the forest to help pinpoint where someone has died, to help in body recovery,\" says UT Knoxville plant biologist Neal Stewart, coauthor on the new paper.</p>\n<p>As a large mammal like a human decomposes in a forest, its breakdown transforms the soil in a number of ways. The body's \"necrobiome\"—all the bacteria that was already in it when it was alive—replicates like crazy in the absence of an immune system. This necrobiome mixes with the microbes in the dirt. \"The soil microbiome will change and, of course, the plant roots will also sense some changes,\" says Stewart. But, he adds, \"we don't really know what those changes are.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1703749#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1703749&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=g6-l5QXr2XI:K3xNivw9Epw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=g6-l5QXr2XI:K3xNivw9Epw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=g6-l5QXr2XI:K3xNivw9Epw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=g6-l5QXr2XI:K3xNivw9Epw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=g6-l5QXr2XI:K3xNivw9Epw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=g6-l5QXr2XI:K3xNivw9Epw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 10:50:40 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Science_forest_1208989971-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"b4733417b2a6475ee1e1b6adb831952d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-04-158_406b68bdccf7c4c6.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":153341,"destBytes":134754,"author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Science_forest_1208989971-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-04-158_406b68bdccf7c4c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=g6-l5QXr2XI:K3xNivw9Epw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn38@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-22-207_162f13a2d0e3ed28.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=g6-l5QXr2XI:K3xNivw9Epw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-20-263_3e3507939d3d1a59.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn34@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-22-042_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-05-601_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599361119223},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 10:58:39","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 10:58:39","title":"Novichok: How are victims surviving poisoning?","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1703704","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1255446459-800x563.jpg\" alt=\"The Novichok agent A-234 molecule—a proposed structure.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1255446459.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1453\" data-width=\"2064\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The Novichok agent A-234 molecule—a proposed structure.

In this version, Hua Mulan is already a well-trained fighter, and she serves for 12 years, although the ballad skips over the details of her military exploits. When she finally returns home, she removes her uniform and meets her war comrades as a woman, who express astonishment that they had never suspected. Mulan explains that if you just see a rabbit in a field, you can't tell whether it's male or female.  </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1703251#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1703251&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 12:00:32 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:V_sGLiPBpWU","linkMd5":"a468fa351d8b013f6e19dbbbfefcdd9d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-58-57-475_8a1ae429b427dac5.webp","destWidth":66,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1009,"destBytes":340,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-58-57-475_8a1ae429b427dac5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=iJEBWt0MJ48:Bf0El8b3d00:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn48@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-41-764_34022c50c34424d7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn34@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-22-042_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-05-601_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599361119223},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 10:58:39","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 10:58:39","title":"Team behind the Russian vaccine publishes some details of early trials","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1703951","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228338462-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a women in medical protective gear holding a box of samples.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228338462.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"682\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> MOSCOW, RUSSIA - SEPTEMBER 4, 2020: Medical staff with newly delivered boxes containing COVID-19 vaccine in a cold room at No2 Outpatient Clinic in southern Moscow.

But its response to that has been a bit... unusual. As many other countries have, Russia worked to develop its own vaccine. But while that development was still in progress, it announced that it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/russia-rushes-to-distribute-its-untested-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v/\">wasn't going to wait for detailed safety data</a>, instead rolling the vaccine out to millions. Shortly afterwards, it became clear that the country was actually going to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/untested-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-begins-40000-person-trial-next-week/\">run a standard phase 3 clinical trial</a>, albeit a large one, involving 40,000 people.</p>\n\n<p>It was hard to judge whether any of this was reasonable, because few details about the vaccine itself were available. But that changed somewhat on Friday, as the people who developed the vaccine published results from the initial clinical trials. And so far, it seems to be about as effective as some of the other vaccine candidates that have been made it past initial trials.</p>\n<h2>Two viruses better than one?</h2>\n<p>As our earlier coverage mentioned, the vaccine is composed of two different engineered viruses. These contain the backbone of an innocuous virus, called an adenovirus, engineered to include the gene that encodes the major surface protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This protein, called Spike, is what the coronavirus uses to latch on to and enter cells.
