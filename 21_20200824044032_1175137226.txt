Here&#8217;s the official synopsis of the book, which weaves two different narratives together:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the 1800s American South, Harriet Jacobs is enslaved and tormented by a cruel master. He relentlessly attempts to force her into a sexual union, and, when rebuffed, he separates her from her children and spends a lifetime trying to coerce her and then recapture her when she escapes to freedom. Jacobs outwits her tormentor and eventually reunites with her children, works in the cause of abolition and reform, and helps newly freed slaves with education and aftercare.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Timothy Ballard encounters a grieving father in Haiti whose three-year-old son has been kidnapped and sold into slavery, along with thousands of children who were orphaned after an earthquake devastated the country. Inspired by Harriet Jacobs, Tim pledges to track down the missing child and leaves his job at the Department of Homeland Security to establish Operation Underground Railroad. This foundation infiltrates black markets in human trafficking, liberates victims, and provides a comprehensive aftercare process involving justice and rehabilitation for survivors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, it seems the focus for the first season may just be Harriet Jacobs. The series is tentatively called <strong><em>Edenton</em></strong>, and it will chronicle her struggle as the first known female slave to document the sexual harassment and abuse she faced while enslaved. It&#8217;s not clear if another season would dive into the 2012 story thread in the book or not.</p>\n<p>Adeleke will be writing the script with <strong>Cody Newton Gifford</strong>, and he&#8217;ll also be producing by way of his 8th Wonder Entertainment production company. <strong>Nick Nanton</strong> will also produce alongside the book&#8217;s author and <strong>Brian Norton</strong>, who are producing through their StoweAway Productions banner.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpI-AyFMVWI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Even though sports have slowly made a comeback in recent weeks, they&#8217;re certainly not back to business as usual. So there&#8217;s no better time to shine a light on what might be the safest sport during a pandemic: fencing.</p>\n<p>One of the first sports to be played in the Olympics, fencing is a sport of swordsmanship and combat, and Deadline has word that Picturestart and Lionsgate TV are working on a scripted TV series about fencing based on a concept by <em>Little Women</em> director <strong>Greta Gerwig</strong>, who is a skilled fencer in her own right (as you can see in the video above).</p>\n<p>The comedy series will follow a ragtag, underdog college fencing team, specifically a female team, and all their trials and tribulations, friendships, and struggles with gender, class and the rules of the sport itself.</p>\n<p>Gerwig wrote the script and was previously attached to direct it as a movie when it was developing with <strong>Erik Feig</strong>. But now that <em>Lady Bird</em> and <em>Little Women</em> are under her belt as a director, she&#8217;s a more sought after filmmaker than she was before. It&#8217;s not clear how involved she&#8217;ll be with the project in its TV form, but it sounds like a promising new show.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We can’t mask our excitement about making <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Leverage2?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Leverage2</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6L2KuPK9Hw\">pic.twitter.com/6L2KuPK9Hw</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Dean Devlin (@Dean_Devlin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dean_Devlin/status/1294771038610481158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>In case you didn&#8217;t hear, there&#8217;s a revival of the crime series <strong><em>Leverage</em></strong> heading to IMDb TV that is now in production down in Louisiana.

He wrote this script with <em>Succession</em>&#8216;s <strong>Simon Blackwell</strong>, and took a color-blind casting approach by putting Dev Patel (<em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>) in the lead role – a decision which apparently pays off wonderfully by revealing a side to the actor we haven&#8217;t seen.

Emmy® winners and Oscar® nominees Armando Iannucci (IN THE LOOP, THE DEATH OF STALIN, HBO&#8217;S Veep) and Simon Blackwell (IN THE LOOP, HBO&#8217;s Succession) lend their wry, yet heart-filled storytelling style to revisiting Dickens&#8217; iconic hero on his quirky journey from impoverished orphan to burgeoning writer in Victorian England.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Personal History of David Copperfield</em> was already released in the United Kingdom and evidently still aims to arrive in theaters in the United States on <strong>August 28</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-personal-history-of-david-copperfield-clip/\">&#8216;The Personal History of David Copperfield&#8217; Clip: Let&#8217;s Go Fly a Kite</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nL-tc5ewCS8:S51mwQc5DpM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nL-tc5ewCS8:S51mwQc5DpM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nL-tc5ewCS8:S51mwQc5DpM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nL-tc5ewCS8:S51mwQc5DpM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nL-tc5ewCS8:S51mwQc5DpM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nL-tc5ewCS8:S51mwQc5DpM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/nL-tc5ewCS8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 18:00:54 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Personal-History-of-David-Copperfield-clip-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"9f61d2dc1b3abbbfea02b51b48ab73fa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/24/04-39-55-499_926e938ca1601841.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":44230,"destBytes":28892,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Personal-History-of-David-Copperfield-clip-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/24/04-39-55-499_926e938ca1601841.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn32@2020_6/2020/08/24/04-39-57-023_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nL-tc5ewCS8:S51mwQc5DpM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/24/04-39-56-924_652b7a054e48d510.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn51@2020_6/2020/08/24/04-39-57-036_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nL-tc5ewCS8:S51mwQc5DpM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn39@2020_5/2020/08/24/04-39-57-113_040202d36aad7ea4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/nL-tc5ewCS8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn16@2020_3/2020/08/24/04-39-56-896_2ef37fb24abf83c7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598243995304}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 12:39:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 12:39:55","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 04:39:55 +0000","fetchMs":31,"handleMs":508,"totalMs":37301,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.205.237.24","hostName":"us-014.herokuapp.com","requestId":"0c613191ca4b45c7acd4b458044bbe45_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":133216,"bgimgsTotal":2,"bgimgsGithubTotal":2,"articlesImgsTotal":13,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":13,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx7":1,"myreaderx15":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx4":1,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx24":1,"myreaderx18":1,"myreaderx19":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 01:13:36","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/22/17-13-36-873_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
