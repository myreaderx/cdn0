In this post, we look at the new capabilities available and how you can use them to create and share stunning dashboards, whether for QuickSight readers in your organization or to embed in your application for end-users.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/09/28/BDB1825-composite-image.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-22325 size-full\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/09/28/BDB1825-composite-image.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"618\"></a></p> \n<h2>What’s new in QuickSight dashboard layouts?</h2> \n<p>Layout modes in QuickSight determine how visuals in a dashboard are sized and presented to end-users, and the degree of flexibility authors have in modifying the dashboard to meet their visual styling needs. QuickSight now supports three layout options for dashboards:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Tiled </strong>– Visuals snap to a grid layout, minimizing effort needed to resize and arrange visuals. Authors can choose the base screen size they’re building for (for example, laptops or HD monitors), and the dashboard scales automatically to any screen width or display, zooming in or out as needed to scale and display the content on the user’s screen as designed by the author. In mobile view, the visuals display as designed when in landscape mode and automatically arrange to a single column when in portrait mode. As the name suggests, visuals are tiled in this mode, and can’t overlap each other.</li> \n <li><strong>Free-form (new!) </strong>– This mode allows visuals to be placed anywhere, including overlapping other visuals, along with pixel-level control over elements on the dashboard. This offers very precise control and detail-oriented design approaches. In this mode, authors still pick a screen size they’re designing for, and dashboards display as designed on all screens, zooming in or out as needed. Because dashboards are designed intricately with overlaps and images, QuickSight doesn’t automatically adjust this view for mobile access, and so mobile users see the author-created layout as is, scaled to fit on their landscape or portrait screen orientation on smaller screens. This mode also offers a new capability of conditionally rendering a visual based on QuickSight parameter-based rules, which opens up creative possibilities for interactive dashboards.</li> \n <li><strong>Classic </strong>– This is the legacy layout mode, where visuals snap to a grid layout. In this mode, QuickSight might show or hide content based on screen sizes, which can cause dashboards to display content differently on different devices.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Existing dashboards will remain in classic mode until authors explicitly modify and republish them in tiled or free-form mode as necessary.</p> \n<h2>Get started with free-form mode</h2> \n<p>You can get started with free-form mode in five easy steps:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Open a new QuickSight analysis and change the layout setting to <strong>Free-form</strong>. \n  <ol type=\"a\"> \n   <li>Optionally, set the <strong>View </strong>to <strong>Fit to window</strong> if you prefer seeing the full canvas (scaled up or down).</li> \n  </ol> </li> \n <li>Try resizing and moving the initial visual around. See how the visual stays where you drop it.</li> \n</ol> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\">When using mouse to move the visuals, they still snap to the closest grid for ease of alignment. Try using the arrow keys for finer adjustments.</p> \n<ol start=\"3\"> \n <li>Add another visual and move it on top of the first visual. See how the visual overlaps the first visual.</li> \n <li>Make the second visual fully overlap the first visual.</li> \n <li>To access the first visual without moving the second visual, choose the visual menu of the second bigger visual and send it backward.</li> \n</ol> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC\" src=\"https://aws-bigdata-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts/Quicksight_freeform_dashboards/GS.gif\" width=\"1728\" height=\"1080\"></p> \n<p>Wondering if you can switch your existing analysis to free-form mode? Sure thing! Choose <strong>Settings</strong> on the left panel of the analysis and choose <strong>Free-form</strong> from the <strong>Layout</strong> options.</p> \n<h2>Get proficient in free-form layout</h2> \n<p>Now that you know the basics, let’s dive deeper. Four groups of settings are key to building in free-form layout: placement, style, interactions, and rules.</p> \n<p>You can access these settings from each visual’s <strong>Format visual</strong> panel.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Placement</strong> – This lets you control the exact position and size of each visual on your dashboard. You do this by specifying the X,Y coordinates (for the top left corner of your visual) and the desired height and width. Keep in mind that the X,Y coordinates start from the top left of your dashboard (the top left point of your dashboard is 0,0 (X,Y)). You can use the mouse to resize and position a visual, but the placement control gives you an easier way to get perfect alignment.<br> <a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/09/23/Theater-GP-1.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22229\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/09/23/Theater-GP-1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1728\" height=\"1080\"></a></li> \n <li><strong>Style </strong>– With style controls, you can set the background, border and selection colors, their transparencies, or turn these off. Disabling the background makes the visual fully transparent. This is extremely useful when you’re layering visuals on top of other visuals for awesome effects.<br> <img class=\"alignnone size-full\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC\" src=\"https://aws-bigdata-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts/Quicksight_freeform_dashboards/Theater-GP-2.gif\" width=\"1728\" height=\"1080\"></li> \n <li><strong>Interactions</strong> – With these controls, you can remove all the visual-level interactions (like drill-downs, sorting, maximizing visuals, and exporting data) when desired. These settings apply to the dashboard view only, and allow you to overlay charts on other charts or images to create the impression of a single composite visual to the end-user.<br> <a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/09/23/Theater-GP-3.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22230\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/09/23/Theater-GP-3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1728\" height=\"1080\"></a></li> \n <li><strong>Rules</strong> – You can set rules to show or hide visuals based on parameter values. All visuals are visible by default. You can add rules on when they should be hidden. Alternatively, you can flip the default state of the visual to hidden and configure rules on when to show the visual. Pair this with overlaid placement of visuals to build dynamic dashboards that respond to user selections or inputs from the parent application (when used in embedded context).<br> <a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/09/28/Theater-GP-4-20210928.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-22326 size-full\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/09/28/Theater-GP-4-20210928.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1728\" height=\"1080\"></a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>You can explore a <a href=\"https://democentral.learnquicksight.online/#Dashboard-FeatureDemo-Free-form-Theater-Seating\">sample dashboard</a> for inspiration, and examine the <a href=\"https://democentral.learnquicksight.online/#Analysis-FeatureDemo-Free-form-Theater-Seating\">analysis view</a> to see how it is built.</p> \n<p>Also check out the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/gallery/\">QuickSight dashboard gallery</a> with samples from our partners.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>With the new free-form layout, QuickSight enables you to build dashboards that can be tailored to meet your exact dashboard specifications, which can then be distributed to hundreds of thousands of users via the QuickSight portal, mobile app, email, or embedded within your own applications.</p> \n<hr> \n<h3>About the Authors</h3> \n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2020/11/24/Jose-Kunnackal-John.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-13942 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2020/11/24/Jose-Kunnackal-John.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"133\"></a>Jose Kunnackal</strong>, is a principal product manager for Amazon QuickSight, AWS’ cloud-native, fully managed BI service.
