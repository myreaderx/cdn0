That efforts starts with Dark Mode for OneDrive web, which we’ll be releasing soon for both commercial and personal accounts.

OneDrive not only makes it easy for you to access and organize your work files, it also helps you get back to the files that matter the most—especially now with Add to OneDrive, a much-awaited feature that we’re rolling out in public preview with the option to opt-out. Now, when someone shares a folder with you in OneDrive, Microsoft SharePoint, or Microsoft Teams, you can easily add a shortcut to that shared folder, either from Shared with me or your shared libraries, in your OneDrive to easily find it later. Added folders retain all the power of OneDrive, which means you can sync and access these folders from anywhere on any device; share and co-author files in added folder; and, stay up-to-date with @mentions, activity, and notifications. Added folders respect all existing policies, compliance, and security settings, too.<BR /><BR /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"4.gif\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/220385iBCDFE0E423F0CD74/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" role=\"button\" title=\"4.gif\" alt=\"Add  shared folders to your OneDrive\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Add  shared folders to your OneDrive</span></span></LI>\n</OL>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<OL start=\"3\">\n<LI><STRONG>OneDrive mobile app updates</STRONG>: <BR /><BR />\n<OL>\n<LI><STRONG>OneDrive Home</STRONG>: <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/welcome-to-the-new-home-screen-on-onedrive-s-mobile-app-for-ios/ba-p/1666510\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OneDrive Home</A> provides easy access to all your files keeping the recent files, shared libraries and critical offline documents &nbsp;just a tap away for whenever you need them.

In an effort to provide a consistent sharing experience across Microsoft 365—no matter where you share your file, whether through Office apps, Outlook, OneDrive, or SharePoint, the sharing experience is similar—we’re bringing some of the sharing capabilities you already know to Teams. Now, users will be able to set familiar sharing and access controls directly in Teams with the added option to share a link with a specific private or group chat. This means only people in that chat have access to the shared content. Shared links intelligently reconcile to file name and all sharing follows the admin settings and configured policies. This feature will be rolling out soon.<BR /><BR /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"teams sharing blog.gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/220749iB5FFFBB914873477/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" role=\"button\" title=\"teams sharing blog.gif\" alt=\"Sharing integration in Microsoft Teams\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Sharing integration in Microsoft Teams</span></span>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P> </P>\n</LI>\n</OL>\n<OL start=\"2\">\n<LI><STRONG>Move and keep sharing:</STRONG> Our files often go through a workflow or lifecycle—from creation to review to final. During this journey, you might need to relocate your file from an individual OneDrive site to a SharePoint shared library to extend its reach to a broader group of collaborators. But doing so should not affect the file’s original access controls. Now, when you transfer an individual file to a shared library, the sharing permissions remain intact.

To protect shared files, administrators can set a mandatory expiration period to ensure access doesn’t last forever and help avoid leaking organization data by accident. This policy can be enabled in the SharePoint admin center (both modern and classic) and applies to both OneDrive and SharePoint. </SPAN><SPAN>Once the policy is implemented, external users will automatically lose access to content on the site-by-site level (or OneDrive-by-OneDrive level).

Admins can also monitor the success of Known Folder Move rollout and see the related progress for each device, like which devices are successfully opted into Known Folder Move, how many folders have moved, and more. Finally, they will be able to drill into sync errors and see the errors on each&nbsp;device, empowering them to proactively solve end user problems.

In the past, if a user chose not to sync their OneDrive Documents or Pictures folders, they were not eligible for Known Folder Move until they synced those folders.&nbsp; Now, we will no longer require users to correct this issue manually; instead, we will do it automatically in the Known Folder Move flow, thus enabling it to be rolled out to more users.&nbsp;​This functionality is available now.<BR /><BR /></LI>\n<LI class=\"lia-indent-padding-left-30px\">Second, admins can now <STRONG>choose which known folders</STRONG> (Desktop, Documents, or Pictures) they would like to move to OneDrive as part of the silent policy—they no longer have to choose all of them at once. This functionality is available now.<BR /><BR /></LI>\n<LI class=\"lia-indent-padding-left-30px\">Third, we are working on a new policy to allow you to <STRONG>specify a file name or file extension you’d like to exclude</STRONG> from sync at the device level. This addresses an issue where certain file types didn’t sync for example when desktop folders full of shortcut files were moved to OneDrive.
