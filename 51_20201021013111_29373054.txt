Les Hortillonnages d'Amiens are an age-old, 300-hectare area of marshland where vegetables and flowers grow on gardens connected by 40 miles of canal.</p>\n<p>One legend claims that the Hortillonnages date back to Roman times, with the term for market gardens, <em>hortillon,</em> originating from the Latin word <em>hortus. </em>But it was in the Middle Ages that locals mined marshland around the loops of the Somme river for peat to burn as fuel. The network of trenches eventually filled with water, creating a labyrinth of highly fertile land and canals, soon utilized by farmers who sold their fresh produce to the bustling market halls of nearby Paris. Hortillons varied in size, and just as with fields, some farmers had larger plots while others cultivated only one. But throughout the years, the work has always been a family affair.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78357/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Without roads, the only way to navigate the vast area is by the flat-bottomed boats used by farmers for centuries. Today, many of the boats take visitors on tours to spot wildlife and the many birds that call this unusual habitat home. The fertile gardens burst with cabbage in all its forms, carrots, leeks, turnips, and radishes, as well as seasonal vegetables such as eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, and melons. The entire area is an oasis of calm, with water lilies floating on the canals, shimmering kingfishers diving for fish, swans gliding past, and dragonflies hovering.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the old ways of the Hortillonnages are dwindling. Farming is a work-intensive career at the best of times, but having to farm in swampland, where your vegetable patches flood every time it rains more than usual and where temperatures near freezing can wreak havoc on delicate crops have turned many people away from the age-old practice. Not to mention, working by boat is a challenge that only a few people are willing to take on.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78353/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>One of those people is Thérèse Nowak. Not only does she work with her husband René in the Hortillonnages, but she also runs a <a href=\"http://www.museedeshortillonnages.fr/\">small museum </a>showcasing the region’s history. It’s a hard job, she stresses. “You don't count your hours, you work even in the rain and in the cold,” she says. “But it's such satisfaction to work this rich and black soil, to see such beautiful vegetables grow, to feed families with fresh, healthy and tasty products, to meet customers in the markets.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the 18th century, there were about 50 hortillons. However, with the development of intensive agriculture and increased imports during the 20th century, many hortillons ceased cultivation, and most of the market gardens have been transformed into pleasure gardens for the people of Amiens who live in town. Today, there are only around 10 hortillons left, most belonging to just one family.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/78361/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>These remaining farmers are struggling to keep the tradition alive in modern times. Some, such as Perrine Parmentier, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Mon-Panier-Nature-282966708918093/\">use Facebook</a> to coordinate vegetable deliveries. Others still bring their produce every Saturday morning to the city’s pretty Saint-Leu quarter, to sell at a floating market. Once a year in June (cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19), the farmers dress up in traditional costume and hold an extended floating market, as a reminder of the old ways.</p>\n<p>Nowak (who is also Perrine Parmentier’s aunt) stresses the significance of this unique way of life. “It's a profession to which I am very attached,” she says. ”It is the job of my parents, of my great-grandparents.”</p>\n<p>But it is not just history and tradition that keeps her going. To her, being a farmer of the Hortillonnages symbolizes all that is wonderful about life in Amiens. \"At the gates of the city, we work in sublime nature. Between land and water, we move in a boat,” she says. “It's magic!”</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78351/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Nowadays, tourism is helping keep this unique region afloat. Aurélie Wallet, from Somme Tourism, explains that opening up the Hortillonnages to tourists played a large part in saving them from being drained and paved over as access roads. It could have been the end of an era, if locals had not leapt into action. “We feared the disappearance of Hortillonnages in the 1970s because of the construction of the bypass and the motorway,” she says. “But the Amiénois mobilized to save their heritage.” Now, sightseeing tours float along the canals, with curious visitors packed into the traditional cornet boats.</p>\n<p>What may best sum up the unbreakable tie between Amiens and its farmers is the story of their cathedral. The country’s largest, dwarfing Notre-Dame in size, it dates to the early 13th century. A farmer donated a drained plot of the Hortillonnages for its construction. Reportedly, the plot had been an artichoke garden, and the artichoke farmer’s good deed was honored by including a statue of him on the face of the cathedral, tying the two wonders of Amiens together for all time.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 22:30:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5bee4703a812c9819bc8c9a023ab7363","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Ulrike Lemmin-Woolfrey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78357/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn13@2020_6/2020/10/21/01-30-12-399_7647a6199e4e58e0.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78353/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_1/2020/10/21/01-30-32-808_2e6d4de6e4caab7a.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/78361/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn19@2020_1/2020/10/21/01-30-12-455_1bb2ed2edc492d82.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78351/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/21/01-30-12-384_df5665007044634a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243812242},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:30:12","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:30:12","title":"What Ancient Toilets Reveal About the History of the Human Gut","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ancient-toilets-microbiome","description":"\n        <p>According to Piers Mitchell, a paleopathologist from the University of Cambridge, scientists have been extracting data from ancient human poop for over a century. “In the past, we’ve been able to look at a single coprolite from a single person”—that is to say, a preserved turd—”and study the microbiome of that one individual.” (The microbiome is the complex collection of microbes living in every animal’s digestive tract.) Now, in a newly released paper in <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0576\"><em>Philosophical Transactions B</em></a><em>, </em>Mitchell and co-authors Susanna Sabin and Kirsten I. Bos have blown the lid off of single-turd analysis: by analyzing two medieval latrines’ worth of number two.</p>\n<p>After receiving samples from a 15th-century latrine in the Christian quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem, as well as a 14th-century latrine in Riga, Latvia, the team was able to successfully separate fecal material from environmental contaminants in the soil. “By looking at the mixed fecal material in these communal latrines, we’ve been able to [study] whole population groups all at once,” Mitchell says. “And what it shows is that the modern, industrialized lifestyle is changing the microbes living in our intestines.”</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78440/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Mitchell knows his shit. As the director of Cambridge’s Ancient Parasites Laboratory, he’s studied storied stools across Europe, Asia, and Africa, some more than 9,000 years old, and when it comes to ancient piles, Mitchell keeps his finger on the pulse. “Whenever [an archaeologist] finds a latrine or coprolites in a part of the world where no one’s done any intestinal fecal analysis, I send them an email.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitchell, our intestinal microbiome isn’t keeping up with the rapid pace of globalization. “Things are changing incredibly quickly,” he says, “but our genetics are still pre-industrial.” He associates modern ills such as high rates of allergies, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease with modern substances that affect the gut, from antibiotics to fast food. “Parts of us are coping, but other parts are suffering,” Mitchell says.</p>\n<p>By mapping the pre-industrial microbiome, archaeologists hope to understand how we developed the internal ecosystems that contribute to our digestion and health. Stephanie Schnorr, a biological anthropologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not affiliated with the new study, says these particular latrines led to a great leap forward. “These data are a great contribution to helping us better resolve our reference taxa for ancient specimens,” she writes, “and they hint at a vast trove of yet unseen microbial diversity hiding in the past.”</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78442/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>“These ancient populations had a broader range of microbes than we have now, and they have some types of microbes that seem to be rare or have disappeared in modern people,” Mitchell says. Only hunter-gatherer communities seem to have microbiomes that roughly match those of pre-industrial people.</p>\n<p>With a clearer picture of ancient and modern microbiomes, Mitchell hopes we can develop treatments that get our guts to a more pre-industrial place. “We’re not trying to give everyone cholera and typhoid again,” he says, “we’re just thinking which are the healthy bits to put back while leaving out the scary nasty diseases.” He imagines treatment could look something like a pill, for example, that would reintroduce or rebalance our inner microbes. Whatever it looks like, the key to a healthy gut-scape may lie within ancient toilets, and Mitchell and his cohort intend to find out.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:36:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a39afaa4a514db8150cf176c63212731","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Luke Fater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78440/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn18@2020_6/2020/10/21/01-30-24-426_a8c5549d052b430c.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/78442/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn10@2020_1/2020/10/21/01-30-32-243_b4ed5ed812f4572b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603243812245},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 09:30:12","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 09:30:12","title":"Fayette Historic Townsite in Garden, Michigan","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fayette-historic-townsite","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"911\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2Q5YmRlNjhiLTQzZTktNDliNC1iNGZiLWM2ZWIwYTk4MTA5MjFlNTE2OWVjNzI5ZTUwOTY3Nl8yMDE5MDUxMF8xMzU1MDYuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCAiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjEyMTF4ODA3KzMrMTUiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIyJdXQ/20190510_135506.jpg\" /></p> <p>The northern shore of Lake <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Michigan\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/michigan\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4423\" data-title=\"Michigan\" data-slug=\"michigan\">Michigan</a> is almost incomprehensibly beautiful, and few places encapsulate that better than the Fayette Historic Townsite.

It then emptied into a reservoir that was located at the city's highest point, now the roof of the Tartan Weaving Mill. A metal ball on the neighboring building acted as a water leveling device. From this reservoir, water would flow down to the numerous water wells, where it was collected by hand and brought back to individual households. </p>\n
