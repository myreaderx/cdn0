Their intricate structures present an intrinsic synthetic challenge and thus attract significant attention from synthetic organic academic community. Over the past decades, a series of elegant strategies has been developed, in particular, the Stork's original Fischer indolization of tricyclic aminoketones <b>1</b>. Herein, we report a comprehensive review on various synthetic approaches access to tricyclic aminoketones <b>1</b> and provide a practical guidance to readers whose are interested in employing tricyclic aminoketones <b>1</b> as versatile building blocks in the realm of total synthesis of <i>aspidosperma</i>, <i>kopsia</i> and structurally related alkaloids.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 09:03:25 +0000","feedId":17783,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f957b71-3c39-4afd-bd85-bcb9268fe1f8/tcr202000131-toc-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"8c8e238e2f7e5602a6338b777cc1b3a1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn98@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-46-42-425_7a75306464905114.webp","destWidth":480,"destHeight":154,"sourceBytes":69759,"destBytes":19536,"author":"\nNengzhong Wang, \nXuefeng Jiang\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f957b71-3c39-4afd-bd85-bcb9268fe1f8/tcr202000131-toc-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn98@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-46-42-425_7a75306464905114.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606999601927}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 20:46:41","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 20:46:41","feedId":17783,"fetchDate":"Thu, 03 Dec 2020 12:46:41 +0000","fetchMs":45471,"handleMs":18,"totalMs":47036,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":38,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"cbec3e0ec715f2ea822d1746028ef921","hostName":"europe65*","requestId":"fd712b10fca34fb7bf415e26427322f1_17783","contentType":"application/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":19536,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx15":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:15:58","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:48:02","id":17783,"name":"Wiley: The Chemical Record: Table of Contents","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/rss/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1528-0691","subscriber":187,"website":null,"icon":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/journal-banners/15280691.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn38@2020_4/2020/09/06/18-48-00-632_d0ad1358a5459f9b.jpg","description":"Table of Contents for The Chemical Record.
