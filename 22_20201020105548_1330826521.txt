William McRaven, a former US Navy SEAL commander who served as the head of US Special Operations Command, wrote an op-ed article in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-will-make-america-lead-again-11603127677\">The Wall Street Journal</a> on Monday in which he said he voted for Joe Biden.</p><p>McRaven described himself as a \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, small-government, strong-defense and a national-anthem-standing conservative\" but said the US was no longer a country that set an example of democracy.</p><p>While McRaven aligned himself with those conservative ideals, he also said \"we need a president for all Americans, not just half of America,\" adding: \"I also believe that black lives matter, that the Dreamers deserve a path to citizenship, that diversity and inclusion are essential to our national success, that education is the great equalizer, that climate change is real and that the First Amendment is the cornerstone of our democracy.\"</p><p>McRaven, who like some other military leaders is outspoken on the importance of international alliances, stressed that the US's influence had been on the decline.</p><p>\"Now, the world no longer looks up to America,\" McRaven wrote. \"They have been witness to our dismissiveness, our lack of respect and our transactional approach to global issues. They have seen us tear up our treaties, leave our allies on the battlefield and cozy up to despots and dictators.\"</p><p>\"They have seen our incompetence in handling the pandemic and the wildfires,\" McRaven added, referring to the country's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-fires-california-archive-523a1c3e4a792972e0c5c2f4c59c07d0#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20In,that%20is%20far%20from%20over.\">record-breaking wildfires</a>. \"They have seen us struggle with social injustice. They no longer think we can lead, because they have seen an ineptness and a disdain for civility that is beyond anything in their memory.\"</p><p>McRaven, who did not specifically name President Donald Trump, ended the article by saying \"I voted for Joe Biden,\" the Democratic presidential nominee.</p><p>McRaven has been a vocal critic of the president. He has given interviews and written numerous opinion articles expressing great frustration with the policies and practices of Trump and his administration, everything from the president's hostile responses to critics to his targeting of long-standing US institutions.</p><p>In 2017, he characterized Trump's repeated criticisms of the media as \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/william-mcraven-trump-media-fake-news-threat-democracy-2017-2\">the greatest threat to democracy</a>\" in his lifetime. The following year, he said Trump had \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-seal-william-mcraven-trump-security-clearance-2018-8\">embarrassed us in the eyes of our children</a>, humiliated us on the world stage, and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.\" In 2019, he wrote an article that said \"our republic is under attack from the president,\" <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/william-mcraven-navy-seal-us-is-under-attack-from-trump-2019-10\">arguing that Trump was harming</a> the \"nation's principles.\"</p><p>This year, McRaven <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcraven-forcefully-clearing-protesters-for-trump-photo-op-not-right-2020-6\">sharply criticized the forceful clearing of Lafayette Park in Washington, DC, by law enforcement</a> for a presidential photo op at a church, saying there was \"nothing morally right\" about what happened. He also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-seal-william-mcraven-trump-is-actively-undermining-us-institutions-2020-8\">called out Trump for his repeated attacks on the US Postal Service</a>, arguing that Trump was undermining not only USPS but every major US institution.</p><p>The retired Navy SEAL held numerous leadership positions within the special-operations community during his nearly four decades in the service, including overseeing the successful military raid that killed the Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. Trump previously criticized McRaven, saying it would have been nice if the US found bin Laden sooner.</p><p>After retiring from the Navy in 2014, McRaven went into academia and has written best-selling books on leadership, including \"Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life ... and Maybe the World\" and \"Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations.\"</p><p>On the subject of leadership, McRaven wrote in Monday's article that \"if we remain indifferent to our role in the world, if we retreat from our obligation to our citizens and our allies and if we fail to choose the right leader, then we will pay the highest price for our neglect and shortsightedness.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Post.</p><p>In the letter, first reported by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276\">Politico</a>, more than 50 former intelligence officers said they believed the emails purportedly belonging to Biden, the son of the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, had \"all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"</p><p>\"We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement — just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case,\" they wrote in the statement.</p><p>The first of multiple articles from the Post about the emails, headlined \"BIDEN'S SECRET E-MAILS,\" suggested that Joe Biden used the power of his position as vice president years ago to help his son Hunter, who sat on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.</p><p>Business Insider's Sonam Sheth <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-giuliani-joe-biden-ukraine-burisma-loophole-2019-9\">wrote about the Biden allegations</a>, saying \"there is no evidence that these claims hold merit, and they've been debunked by intelligence assessments, news reports, congressional investigations, and witness testimony.\"</p><p>Sheth also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-post-hunter-joe-biden-giuliani-red-flags-disinformation-2020-10\">identified</a> several \"red flags\" with the initial Post report and spoke with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spies-hunter-biden-emails-trump-giuliani-vulnerable-russian-intelligence-2020-10\">former spies</a> who said the incident had exposed the president's lawyer Giuliani as vulnerable to Russian disinformation.</p><p>A major point of skepticism about the Post stories was their sourcing: The tabloid came into possession of contents from a laptop hard drive that purportedly belonged to Hunter Biden after Giuliani delivered a copy of the hard drive to the outlet. A laptop containing the hard drive was said to have been left at a repair shop, and the shop's owner, a Trump supporter, gave material from the computer to Giuliani.</p><p>The FBI is now investigating whether the emails were <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-investigating-hunter-biden-burisma-emails-foreign-intelligence-operation-2020-10\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"56f7315e2ecbf9e2334c6d8b9c9bc52c\">part of a foreign intelligence operation</a>, following a <a

data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"6ac877e1f12dbd2ef6d6abbdd9a63177\">Washington Post report</a> that Giuliani was targeted by Russian intelligence.</p><p>The former intel officials wrote they believe the arrival of the contents, which they dubbed a \"laptop op,\" to the tabloid was a cause for suspicion, \"as the publication of the emails are clearly designed to discredit\" the elder Biden.</p><p>\"Such an operation would be consistent with some of the key methods Russia has used in its now multi-year operation to interfere in our democracy — the hacking (via cyber operations) and the dumping of accurate information or the distribution of inaccurate or misinformation,\" they said.</p><p>\"It is high time that Russia stops interfering in our democracy,\" the letter concluded.</p><p>The dozens of former intelligence officials aren't the only ones to have been skeptical — some journalists at the New York Post also expressed doubts in publishing the emails' contents. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/business/media/new-york-post-hunter-biden.html\">The New York Times</a> reported that at least two writers refused to put their bylines on the story, including one who was mostly responsible for writing it, two Post employees told The Times.</p><p>A reporter for the Post told <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/10/new-york-post-insiders-slag-flimsy-hunter-biden-stories.html\">New York magazine</a> that they thought the stories were \"very flimsy.\"</p><p>Another journalist said the reporting on the stories was \"not something that meets my journalistic standards,\" adding that the initial Post article \"should not have been published.\"</p><div

She and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held multiple talks over the weekend on a deal, but the two sides remain far apart, which stripped over 1.5% off the three major indices.</p><p>\"All in all, a fresh stimulus bill before the elections remains far from certain and we suspect there is not much of it currently being priced in by the markets, which should keep the downside for risk assets relatively limited if prospects of a bipartisan-deal eventually collapse. This should be the main driver for global markets today,\" ING strategist Chris Turner said.&#160;</p><p><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Read More:&#160;</em></strong><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-outlook-crowded-trades-overweight-underweight-stocks-ubs-asset-managers-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-outlook-crowded-trades-overweight-underweight-stocks-ubs-asset-managers-2020-10\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">These are the 10 most crowded trades among global money managers, UBS says. The biggest underweight stocks might surprise you</a></em></p><p>The <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/stoxx_europe_600\">Stoxx 600</a> traded almost unchanged on the day, as gains in retail and health care stocks were offset by losses in natural resources and oil and gas stocks. UBS was one of the top gainers among the banking sector, rising by 2.3%.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/ftse_100\">FTSE 100</a> gained 0.2% on the day, lifted by the likes of supermarket chain Tesco and clothing retailer Next, while Paris' <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/cac_40\">CAC 40</a> rose 04% and Frankfurt's <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/dax\">DAX</a> slipped 0.3%.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/vdax\">VDAX-New</a>, an index of options volatility on the DAX, rose nearly 2.5%, reflecting growing investor nervousness.&#160;</p><p>Cases of coronavirus are surging in many large European countries. In the UK, the Welsh national government instituted a two-week \"circuit-breaker\" lockdown across the country, while in Ireland, the government said it would close much of the economy and impose tough restrictions on movement to stem the spread of the disease.</p><p>With risk aversion rising, the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/us-dollar-index\">dollar index</a> edged up around 0.1%, mainly driven by losses in the pound, which eased, after the British government dismissed efforts by European Union negotiators to resume negotiations over post-Brexit trade this week.&#160;</p><p>\"A bit like the US fiscal stimulus, this is now a political dance. We hope no one stumbles!\" Deutsche Bank chief strategist Jim Reid said in a note Tuesday.</p><p>The pound slipped 0.5% against the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/gbp-usd\">dollar</a> to $1.2943 and by 0.1% against the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/eur-gbp\">euro</a> to 0.9092 pence.</p><p>Futures on the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/futures/s&p-500-futuresures\">S&#38;P 500</a>, the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/futures/dow-futures\">Dow Jones</a> and the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/futures/nasdaq-100-futures\">Nasdaq 100</a> were up between 0.4% and 0.8%, suggesting investors may focus instead on earnings later in the day as a more immediate catalyst.&#160;</p><p>Technology firms Netflix and Snapchat, as well as consumer goods producer Procter &#38; Gamble, tobacco group Philip Morris and defense group Lockheed Martin are among those reporting quarterly earnings.</p><p>In the commodities sector, a slightly stronger dollar ate into demand for the likes of <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/gold-price\">gold</a>, which fell 0.4% to around $1,904 an ounce, but analysts said the price could well stage a bounce back, particularly in the even of a deal on US stimulus.</p><p>\"This evening will apparently determine whether the aid package can be approved before the presidential elections in two weeks' time, so the market will no doubt follow the talks in Washington very closely,\" Commerzbank said in a note. \"Gold could profit in the event of a deal because the US dollar would presumably be in less demand then and would probably depreciate.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the rise in cases of Covid-19 around the world weighed on crude oil. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price\">Brent crude</a> futures fell 0.4% to around $42.50 a barrel, while <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price?type=wti\">WTI futures</a> fell 0.1% to $41.02 a barrel.&#160;</p><p><strong

program that Congress created to \"preserve aviation jobs\" has instead led to 16,655 layoffs across the industry while overpaying companies that fired workers, a <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7229980/PSP-Report-Final.pdf\">congressional investigation</a> concluded earlier this month.</p><p>The Payroll Support Program, which was established

this month</a>, tasked the US Treasury Department with allocating $3 billion to aviation contractors to help them avoid unnecessary layoffs as the pandemic ground travel to a halt.</p><p>The money was intended to cover companies' payroll for six months, until September 30, and in exchange, recipients were supposed to keep workers employed for those six months.</p><p>But the Treasury Department's \"delays\" and \"perverse\" approach to implementing the PSP encouraged companies to fire workers while they waited to receive funds, the House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis concluded in a <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7229980/PSP-Report-Final.pdf\">report</a> published on October 9.</p><p>The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on this story.</p><p>Despite the CARES Act requiring the Treasury Department to start disbursing funds by April 6, it didn't send the first payment until May 15, while some contractors didn't get paid until September, according to the committee's report.</p><p>\"These delays led at least 15 different aviation contractors to lay off or furlough at least 16,655 employees before the agreements took effect, more than 15% of the existing aviation contractor workforce.\" it said.</p><p>The Treasury Department also let companies continue to lay off workers while their PSP applications were pending — without adjusting their payout amounts, without requiring them to rehire those workers, and without imposing deadlines by which they had to spend the funds, the report said.</p><p>\"This decision had the perverse effect of incentivizing companies to lay off or furlough workers before executing the agreement,\" \"stockpile the money rather than rehire laid-off workers,\" and receive \"payroll support for jobs that no longer existed,\" it added.</p><p>Internal emails from Swissport, which received more than $170 million from taxpayers, revealed that it \"'urgently' sought to 'furlough or terminate' staff before signing the PSP agreement to avoid 'unnecessary costs once the ink is on the paper,'\" the report said.</p><p>Along with Swissport, Gate Gourmet and Flying Food Fare were some of the worst abusers of the loopholes created by the Treasury Department, according to the report, laying off or furloughing a combined 13,070 workers after the PSP applications opened.</p><p>Swissport, Gate Gourmet, and Flying Food Fare did not respond to a request for comment on this story.</p><p>Some companies even used the funds to pay top executives even as they continued layoffs or hadn't yet hired back workers they already let go, according to the report.</p><p>Flying Food Fare, which ultimately got more than $85 million from taxpayers, \"restored senior executives and management to full pay\" in anticipation of receiving its funds even as it laid off 477 workers in May alone.</p><p>Gate Gourmet fired 4,958 and furloughed 104 workers after it submitted its PSP application. But while it brought some back after it received the funds, unlike other contractors, it returned management to \"full salaries\" following their 20% pay cut in April — despite thousands still being out of work, the report said.</p><p>While the CARES Act sought to inject more than <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-the-2-trillion-stimulus-bill-means-healthcare-industry-2020-3?r=ts-sub\">$2.2 trillion</a> into a US economy pummeled by the coronavirus, relief has not always been distributed as Congress had hoped.

took over the embattled company, that included a $185 million consulting deal.</p><p>But Neumann may have invalidated that contract after he \"may have violated\" its terms, WeWork executive chairman Marcelo Claure suggested Monday during a virtual event hosted by <a

parts of the consulting agreement, so that's no longer in effect.\"</p><p>Claure, who is also the COO, executive vice president, and a board director at SoftBank, didn't say which terms Neumann allegedly breached because it relates to an ongoing lawsuit over Neumann's exit package, but added that the former WeWork CEO and chairman had been \"incredibly helpful\" when SoftBank stepped in to rescue WeWork, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>WeWork, SoftBank, and a spokesperson for Neumann did not respond to requests for comment on this story.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/softbank-agrees-to-rescue-wework-in-a-bailout-deal-2019-10?r=ts-sub\">Neumann's exit package</a> also included the option to sell up to $970 million of WeWork stock to SoftBank as well as a $500 million credit line, but <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-founder-adam-neumann-sues-softbank-over-tender-offer-2020-5?r=ts-sub\">Neumann sued the
