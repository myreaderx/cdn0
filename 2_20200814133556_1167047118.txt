The appeals court forcefully rejected Judge Lucy Koh's 2019 analysis of Qualcomm's business practices and held that Qualcomm's behavior was merely \"hypercompetitive,\" not anticompetitive.</p>\n<p>The two rulings could not have been more different. In last year's 233-page ruling, Judge Koh explained Qualcomm's business practices in so much detail that it took us <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/how-qualcomm-shook-down-the-cell-phone-industry-for-almost-20-years/\">more than 3,500 words</a> just to summarize her findings. This week's <a href=\"https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/08/11/19-16122.pdf\">ruling</a> by the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court was shorter—56 pages—and more theoretical.</p>\n<p>The appeals court acknowledged that \"from 2006 to 2016, Qualcomm possessed monopoly power in the CDMA modem chip market, including over 90% of market share.\" However, the court found that the Federal Trade Commission—which brought the lawsuit against Qualcomm—had failed to prove that Qualcomm had abused that power. The court reasoned that Qualcomm's licensing practices were simply designed to maximize the company's revenue—and that in itself isn't illegal.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698262#p3\">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698262&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=C1g57Etfj4Q:ZkumLdZ25qo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=C1g57Etfj4Q:ZkumLdZ25qo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=C1g57Etfj4Q:ZkumLdZ25qo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=C1g57Etfj4Q:ZkumLdZ25qo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=C1g57Etfj4Q:ZkumLdZ25qo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=C1g57Etfj4Q:ZkumLdZ25qo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 12:52:12 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/qualcomm-flies-free-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"42ddc24e90963300a2608522ee037114","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn43@2020_6/2020/08/14/13-35-27-295_1afa8b651044156d.webp","author":"Timothy B.

While essential people in certain industries have continued their jobs in ways that are relatively familiar under layers upon layers of personal protective equipment, many companies have had to find ways to continue other work at a “social” distance. And in those situations, employees must find ways to continue collaborating as they did when they were packed into cubicles, open floor plans, and all the other various patterns of modern office spaces.</p>\n<p>Workplace changes due to COVID-19 won’t go away anytime soon. Tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have pushed back the return of employees to offices until well into 2021, and Twitter has declared that employees need never return to the corporate office. Companies in other industries are making the same sorts of calculations, while employees are rethinking not just how they work but even where they live.</p>\n<p>All of this hinges on the evolution of tools that make this remote way of work possible.

It's also an old star, and it has reached the stage when it glows a dull red and expands, with the hot core only having a tenuous gravitational grip on its outer layers. This combination means that we're actually able to resolve different areas on the star's surface, despite the fact that it resides over 700 light years away.</p>\n<p>That ability came in handy late last year when Betelgeuse did something unusual: it dimmed so much that the difference was visible to the naked eye. Telescopes pointed at the giant were able to determine that—rather than a tidy, uniform drop in luminance—Betelgeuse's dimming <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/new-image-shows-betelgeuse-isnt-dimming-evenly/\">was unevenly distributed</a>, giving the star an odd, squished shape when viewed from Earth. That raised lots of questions about what was going on with the giant, with some experts speculating that, because of Betelgeuse's size and advanced age, the strange behavior was a sign of a supernova in the making.</p>\n\n<p>Now, an international team of observers is here to throw cold water on the possible explosion. Said researchers were lucky to have the Hubble pointed at Betelgeuse before, during, and after the dimming event. Combined with some timely ground observations, this data indicates a rather mundane reason for the star getting darker: a big burp that formed a cloud of dust near the star.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698931#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1698931&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qMIUNC5ri1A:T4hbv47ubNM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qMIUNC5ri1A:T4hbv47ubNM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qMIUNC5ri1A:T4hbv47ubNM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qMIUNC5ri1A:T4hbv47ubNM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qMIUNC5ri1A:T4hbv47ubNM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qMIUNC5ri1A:T4hbv47ubNM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 10:45:57 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/heic2014c-800x640.jpg","linkMd5":"8c8a12378691a0c38c6d105617819356","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/14/13-34-47-314_8e99e6910905005d.webp","author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/heic2014c-800x640.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/14/13-34-47-314_8e99e6910905005d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qMIUNC5ri1A:T4hbv47ubNM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_3/2020/08/14/13-35-29-010_3ecb57331e6e0a8c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qMIUNC5ri1A:T4hbv47ubNM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn4@2020_1/2020/08/14/13-35-55-621_230d07b9703ad08f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn19@2020_4/2020/08/14/13-35-52-980_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn88@2020_4/2020/08/14/13-35-43-232_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-14 21:34:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-14 21:34:46","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 13:34:46 +0000","fetchMs":60,"handleMs":1199,"totalMs":71278,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.213.218.43","hostName":"europe-020.herokuapp.com","requestId":"b32181641cc34bd99299009aeac0ca87_2","bgimgsTotal":4,"bgimgsGithubTotal":4,"articlesImgsTotal":15,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":15},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-14 18:12:15","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn40@2020_5/2020/08/14/13-34-45-962_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
