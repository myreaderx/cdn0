One of the most successful and popular authors of the Gilded Age, Roe was plunged into obscurity upon his death in 1888. During the 1870s and 80s, however, it was customary for households to display volumes of his works in conspicuous places. </p>\n<p>The tablet reads “NEAR TO NATVRE’S HEART,” a reference to his 1876 novel of the same name, first published in <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in London, England\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/london-england\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"24\" data-title=\"London, England\" data-slug=\"london-england\">London</a>. </p>\n<p>Roe was a horticulturist and nature-lover who spent his childhood wandering the nearby Moodna Creek with his sisters and playing in the trees of his family's garden. His uncles belonged to the New York Horticultural Society, and tended to market gardens and an orchard at their estates in Newburgh. </p>\n<p>With the success of his novels, which had a religious bent, Roe chose to remain in the village of his upbringing, Cornwall-on-Hudson, where he maintained vast gardens. He began experimenting with berry varieties and flower beds. When his literary entourage came to visit from New York City, Roe would take them hiking in the mountainous woods behind his house. </p>\n<p>He was known to sit atop a particular boulder, and that's where the memorial tablet was placed. Due to overgrowth and erosion, it now seems impossible to reach. An old sign and ropes lead to the top of the boulder, which boasts an incredible view of the Hudson Highlands and Newburgh Bay.  <br /><br /></p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzkzMGZkM2ViLTEyY2UtNGFlZC05MmFlLWNhZTdlYTZjMjQ1NjYzMTMyNWUwMWUyMzQyODM1Nl9JTUdfMDg2OC5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/IMG_0868.jpg","linkMd5":"3c9cb21c3f0aa36390b2a8dbe9943b89","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn8@2020_1/2020/08/17/16-36-55-519_9fbe1ba5748e65a7.webp","metaImg":"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzkzMGZkM2ViLTEyY2UtNGFlZC05MmFlLWNhZTdlYTZjMjQ1NjYzMTMyNWUwMWUyMzQyODM1Nl9JTUdfMDg2OC5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/IMG_0868.jpg","destWidth":600,"destHeight":450,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzkzMGZkM2ViLTEyY2UtNGFlZC05MmFlLWNhZTdlYTZjMjQ1NjYzMTMyNWUwMWUyMzQyODM1Nl9JTUdfMDg2OC5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/IMG_0868.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_4/2020/08/17/16-37-27-804_8e652e3b60e8007d.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:36:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:36:55","title":"Myouryuji (Ninja Temple) in Kanazawa, Japan","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/myouryuji-ninja-temple","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1365\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2ZjMDA1YjA1LWEyY2YtNDk5Mi1hNzRhLTMzNTE5MDEwZjNhOGVhNDdjODY3MWYyYzEzNjE3N184NTI0Njc5Nzc0XzNhMmZiMmE5OTdfay5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/8524679774_3a2fb2a997_k.jpg\" /></p> <p>Originally established in 1583 as a small prayer hall by samurai lord Maeda Toshiie, the Myōryū-ji temple was built in 1643, by his son Toshitsune. Hoping to prevent the Tokugawa shogunate from laying him off, Toshitsune married Tokugawa's daughter and purposefully played the fool while he founded a temple complex where his samurai warriors could live and keep possible enemies under close surveillance. </p>\n<p>Designed as a secret fortress, the temple contains a variety of tricks and gimmicks, such as hidden stairs and rooms, pit traps, underground tunnels, and a watchtower. Because the government at the time prohibited construction of buildings more than three stories high, Toshitsune designed the temple so that it would appear to be two stories high on the outside—but is actually has four stories on the inside. There are 23 rooms and 29 staircases, as well as two hidden mezzanines. </p>\n<p>The watchtower, for example, can be accessed through a door hidden in the middle of a secret staircase disguised as a closet. One of the staircases has a hidden trap pit that leads down to the servants' room, so that an unwary intruder could be attacked by a guard stationed below.</p>\n<p>Another possible gimmick is the well, located at the center of the building. It's 80 feet deep, but there—supposedly, though this is unconfirmed—a tunnel that branches off of it, about 12 feet above water's surface, that leads to nearby Kanazawa Castle. But no one has ever attempted to use the tunnel and no known historical texts mention its existence.</p>\n<p>These secrets and quirks have led the temple to be known as the Ninja Temple, even though (to the best of our knowledge) it has never been associated with covert agents known as ninjas. Due to its architectural complexities and current decrepit state, visitors need to book a group tour in advance and be accompanied by a guide. </p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2ZjMDA1YjA1LWEyY2YtNDk5Mi1hNzRhLTMzNTE5MDEwZjNhOGVhNDdjODY3MWYyYzEzNjE3N184NTI0Njc5Nzc0XzNhMmZiMmE5OTdfay5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/8524679774_3a2fb2a997_k.jpg","linkMd5":"a738d7232e08fa76a2d6a208455096ae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn97@2020_3/2020/08/17/16-36-55-421_363c28013b06df2d.webp","metaImg":"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2ZjMDA1YjA1LWEyY2YtNDk5Mi1hNzRhLTMzNTE5MDEwZjNhOGVhNDdjODY3MWYyYzEzNjE3N184NTI0Njc5Nzc0XzNhMmZiMmE5OTdfay5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/8524679774_3a2fb2a997_k.jpg","destWidth":600,"destHeight":400,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2ZjMDA1YjA1LWEyY2YtNDk5Mi1hNzRhLTMzNTE5MDEwZjNhOGVhNDdjODY3MWYyYzEzNjE3N184NTI0Njc5Nzc0XzNhMmZiMmE5OTdfay5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/8524679774_3a2fb2a997_k.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn19@2020_6/2020/08/17/16-36-55-390_84d71d46b35ae721.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:36:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:36:54","title":"Lowell Mausoleum in Flagstaff, Arizona","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lowell-mausoleum-observatory","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1536\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzEyZjczNDI2LTExMTEtNGNlNy04MjRlLTY0YjQxMzdmNjZjMjMwM2E0YzcxYmY2YTAxYjZmMl9EU0NfMDI3Mi5KUEciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/DSC_0272.JPG\" /></p> <p>A small mausoleum located on a windswept mountainside is the final resting place of a businessman-turned-astronomer whose work led to the discovery of Pluto.</p>\n<p>Just steps away from a historic telescope on the property of Flagstaff's <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lowell-observatory\">Lowell Observatory</a>, the small, domed structure contains the remains of Percival Lowell, a wealthy and connected member of a prominent Boston family. While his background included running cotton mills and diplomatic visits to Asia, Lowell became fascinated by what he thought were “canals” on Mars and decided, in his late 30s, to study astronomy and map them.</p>\n<p>After building an observatory in 1894, Lowell spent the rest of his life studying the sky. And while his maps of the Martian canals have been disproved, his facility and research greatly added to our knowledge of our universe and led to the discovery of Pluto. Lowell theorized there was an unseen ninth planet and, though he died before Pluto was discovered, a member of his observatory staff, Clyde Tombaugh, was the one to do so.</p>\n<p>Lowell died in 1916. As his mausoleum was being constructed, his coffin sat out on the hill nearby in a burial vault. He was finally interred in 1923. Later on, the framework surrounding the pieces of stained glass in the mausoleum’s dome started to leak and rust in the Flagstaff weather, resulting in reddish color tracks that ran down its sides. While that tint was pretty scenic on fall evenings, the observatory trust decided in the late 1990s to add a cover for protection and weather-proofing, and they cleaned up the red streaks.</p>\n<p>You can still peek through the grate covering the door and look up at the blue and purple panes of stained glass that let in the light of the night sky that fascinated Percival so much.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzEyZjczNDI2LTExMTEtNGNlNy04MjRlLTY0YjQxMzdmNjZjMjMwM2E0YzcxYmY2YTAxYjZmMl9EU0NfMDI3Mi5KUEciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/DSC_0272.JPG","linkMd5":"1289a6272e0a6f1242db19d3b88cc4af","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/17/16-36-55-500_f879227f90efe657.webp","metaImg":"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzEyZjczNDI2LTExMTEtNGNlNy04MjRlLTY0YjQxMzdmNjZjMjMwM2E0YzcxYmY2YTAxYjZmMl9EU0NfMDI3Mi5KUEciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/DSC_0272.JPG","destWidth":600,"destHeight":450,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzEyZjczNDI2LTExMTEtNGNlNy04MjRlLTY0YjQxMzdmNjZjMjMwM2E0YzcxYmY2YTAxYjZmMl9EU0NfMDI3Mi5KUEciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/DSC_0272.JPG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/17/16-36-55-476_b46cd2e75c63b81c.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:36:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:36:54","title":"How to Make Ice-Cream Cocktails Like a True Wisconsinite","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-ice-cream-cocktails","description":"\n        <p><em>This article and these recipes are excerpted from </em><a href=\"https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/5810.htm\">Wisconsin Cocktails</a><em><a href=\"https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/5810.htm\"> by Jeanette Hurt</a>.

In Wisconsin, though, ordering one will get you not so much a drink but decadence embodied. Across the state, Brandy Alexanders and Grasshoppers are a dessert, often topped with whipped cream, sometimes topped with chocolate pieces, but almost always made with ice cream. And, of course, booze.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, booze and ice cream together is called a boozy milkshake. Though some Wisconsin bars and restaurants now put “boozy milkshakes” on their menus, most places still call them ice-cream drinks. Or, rather, just drinks. And any supper club—the fancy, countryside restaurants that came of age in the '40s but <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-is-a-supper-club\">never went out of style in Wisconsin</a>—worth its relish tray serves up hundreds of them on a Saturday evening.</p>\n<p>But how did Wisconsin end up combining booze and ice cream together—and combining them in such large quantities?</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/77208/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Part of the answer to this question is just that Wisconsin is America’s Dairyland, and though it produces plenty of heavy cream and half-and-half, the state produces a lot more ice cream and frozen custard. Two Rivers, Wisconsin, claims to be the birthplace of the ice-cream sundae, and the Wisconsin dairy industry has always promoted ice cream.</p>\n<p>“The whole kind of dairy tradition—custard and ice cream—is so strong, it kind of makes sense that they were paired together with cocktails,” says John Dye, owner of three historic bars in Milwaukee, Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, At Random, and The Jazz Estate. “I’ve always been of the opinion that in Wisconsin, we can take anything that’s bad for you and make it worse.”</p>\n<p>Besides the strong dairy tradition, Wisconsin also has a strong manufacturing tradition. The first blender (as we know it) was invented by a Polish immigrant, Stephen Poplawski, in Racine, Wisconsin. In 1922, he received a patent “for the first mixer of my design having an agitating element mounted in a base and adapted to be drivingly connected with the agitator in the cup.” In 1940, he patented a home mixer and later sold his business to the John Oster Manufacturing Co., which renamed this mixer the Osterizer.</p>\n<p>But that’s just one of the blenders with Wisconsin roots. Another forerunner of the blender, the Cyclone Drinks Mixer, was also invented in Wisconsin, in 1911. Even during Prohibition, the inventors kept working on the device, and in the ‘30s, they approached big-band leader Fred Waring for financing, which would be a bit like approaching Taylor Swift or Kanye today. A former engineering student who liked gadgets, Waring promoted the heck out of it and plugged its use for cocktails. It’s still known as the Waring blender.</p>\n<p>For a long time, blenders were manufactured in Wisconsin by both companies, and sold to plenty of homes, bars, and restaurants within the state. Having them on hand could be a reason why Wisconsin residents enjoy ice-cream drinks—because the bars and restaurants were outfitted to make them.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/77146/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>It’s also the case, as I was surprised to learn, that Wisconsin has a much stronger and consistent devotion to cocktails, and unique drinking culture, than perhaps anywhere else in the United States.</p>\n<p>I realized this four years ago, while working on a book proposal called “The United Drinks of America.” The idea was that every state has its own unique cocktail, and every state has its own unique drinking culture.</p>\n<p>What I learned, from researching this idea, is that some drinks definitely were invented in some states—the Alabama Slammer, for example, was definitely invented in Alabama. The Sazerac (and the Hurricane and a whole bunch of other cocktails) were invented in New Orleans.</p>\n<p>But while most states have some semblance of a drinking culture, it’s not usually very interesting, or it’s not really that different from many other states, and most states don’t really have an official or even unofficial cocktail that practically everyone in the state either drinks or at least holds an opinion about. This surprised me. Because I live in Wisconsin. Everyone here knows that the Old Fashioned is our unofficial state cocktail, and most of us hold strong opinions about how we should drink them—brandy or bourbon; sweet, sour, or pressed; and whether a cherry or pickled Brussels sprout or whatever should be served with it. We have cocktails that are so unique to Wisconsin that if we ask for them a certain way, whether we’re in Las Vegas or Orlando, Manhattan or Miami, the bartender will go, “Oh, are you from Wisconsin?”</p>\n<p>Not only that, Wisconsin never stopped making cocktails. While some states may have experienced what lofty craft mixologists consider to be the “Dark Age of Cocktails,” aka the 1970s and 1980s, we never did. Go to any dive bar, corner tavern, or sports bar in Wisconsin, and the bartenders should know how to make a proper Old Fashioned (even if it’s not muddled, and they add a cherry syrup or old-fashioned mix to make it quickly). They also should add more than a measly pickle to garnish your Bloody Mary, and they sure as heck know that every good Bloody deserves a beer chaser or snit. And even if they don’t advertise it on their menu, they might just make you a proper Grasshopper with ice cream—and if they don’t serve ice-cream drinks, the place next door probably does.</p>\n<p>So if you want to learn from a century of strong, dairy-heavy cocktail culture, grab a blender, choose a recipe, and cool off with one of these six ice-cream drinks like a true Wisconsinite.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/77149/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\">Grasshopper</h3>\n<p>Amy Wimmer, owner, The Del-Bar, Wisconsin Dells</p>\n<p><em>½ oz. green crème de menthe<br /></em><em>½ oz. white crème de cacao<br /></em><em>3 scoops vanilla ice cream</em></p>\n<p>GLASS: poco, hurricane, or rocks<br />GARNISH: homemade whipped cream and drizzle of crème de menthe</p>\n<p>Pour crème de menthe and crème de cacao into the bottom of a blender.
