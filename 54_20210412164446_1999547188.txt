It's a win-win – HR gets qualified candidates while employees feel motivated to assist in the search process.</p> \n<p>The caveat we often see is that if the employee leaves the company within a certain window, the reward is null and void. Why give out a commission if the company won't see a return on their investment? This is the same principle behind performance marketing.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png\"></a></p> \n<p>Let's dive into how performance marketing works, its benefits, and the tools you can use to implement it in your strategy.</p> \n<p>With a traditional ad campaign approach, there's no guarantee you will get a return on your investment. Once your ad launches, you can only monitor its performance and make adjustments.</p> \n<p>The better and quicker you are at identifying areas for improvement, the better your chances of maximizing your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/return-on-ad-spend?_ga=2.265507855.1655273815.1617394435-317637496.1617394435\">return on ad spend</a> (ROAS). But even seasoned <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-buying\">media buyers can </a>have unsuccessful campaigns if there's misalignment between the campaign and the target audience.</p> \n<p>Performance marketing places the power back into advertisers' hands. Because you'll only be paying when your goals are met, you accomplish three things:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your campaign is less risky</li> \n <li>There's a guaranteed return on investment (ROI)</li> \n <li>You have better control over your ad spend</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Is affiliate marketing the same as performance marketing?</h2> \n<p>Short answer: yes and no.</p> \n<p>Think of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/affiliate-marketing-guide\">affiliate marketing</a> as a subset of performance marketing. The terms are often used interchangeably. However, performance marketing has grown to cover more than just affiliates over the years.</p> \n<p>It also comprises campaigns that use pay-per-click (PPC) models, such as paid search.</p> \n<h2>How Performance Marketing Works</h2> \n<p>There are three key players needed to execute a performance marketing strategy:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A publisher or an affiliate partner</li> \n <li>A conversion goal</li> \n <li>A commission rate</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You, as the advertiser, will seek out an affiliate partner, which can be an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-influencer-examples\">influencer</a> or publisher.</p> \n<p>You must then outline your conversion goals. Let's say your marketing objective for the quarter is to gain 10,000 leads. You can instruct your partner to direct traffic to your landing page and they will only earn a commission once a user has filled out the form.</p> \n<p>Your next question might be, \"<em>How do advertisers know which users come from which affiliate?\"</em> Advertisers typically give each partner a specific link or code to track who is responsible for that conversion goal.</p> \n<p>For instance, if I was an influencer and I partnered with <a href=\"https://brandonblackwood.com/\">Brandon Blackwood</a>, I would share a 10% discount code \"MARTINA10\" with my followers to use at checkout when purchasing an item from the brand. Every time someone used my code to purchase, I would get a percentage of the sale.</p> \n<p>Today, performance marketing is most popular with influencers, as <a href=\"https://www.matternow.com/blog/matter-survey-reveals-consumers-find-influencers-more-helpful-and-trustworthy-than-brands-during-the-pandemic/\">studies show</a> consumers trust influencers more than brands.</p> \n<p>Before influencers, there were online publishers, and they are still big players in performance marketing. If you search \"Top Performance Marketing Tools\" on Google and land on a listicle, there's a chance one of these tools may be an affiliate link.</p> \n<p>How can you know for sure? Well, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) now requires affiliate partners to disclose their partnerships to consumers. On Instagram, you'll see the \"paid partnership\" tag, like this:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"performance marketing example on Instagram\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Performance%20Marketing%20Works%20%5B+6%20Tools%20You%20Can%20Use%5D-4.jpeg?width=490&amp;name=How%20Performance%20Marketing%20Works%20%5B+6%20Tools%20You%20Can%20Use%5D-4.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"490\"></p> \n<p>On websites and YouTube video descriptions, you'll see affiliate disclosures, like this:<img alt=\"affiliate disclosure example on YouTube\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Performance%20Marketing%20Works%20%5B+6%20Tools%20You%20Can%20Use%5D.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20Performance%20Marketing%20Works%20%5B+6%20Tools%20You%20Can%20Use%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<h2>How To Create a Performance Marketing Strategy</h2> \n<h3>1. Define your goals.</h3> \n<p>With any digital marketing campaign, establishing your objectives is key.</p> \n<p>What do you want to accomplish? It may be general brand awareness, sales for your new product line, more leads, or something else.</p> \n<p>Let's go back to the world where I'm an influencer. Let's say Brandon Blackwood just came out with a new product. Their marketing goal is to raise awareness of the new product and drive traffic to its product page to generate sales. In this case, their key metrics would be website clicks and unique sales.</p> \n<p>Once you define your goals, you can develop your ad strategy and determine which metrics to track.</p> \n<h3>2. Identify your partners.</h3> \n<p>Now that you know what you want to achieve, start looking at online publishers and social media influencers whose audiences align with your own.</p> \n<p>Identifying the right partners will require extensive research but it's arguably the most important step.</p> \n<p>Imagine working with a partner whose audience has no interest in your brand or product. Although they may interact at some level, they likely won't convert.</p> \n<p>And while you may not lose money, given that they would need to perform a particular action, it would be a waste of your time and resources.</p> \n<p>After identifying who you want to work with, reach out to them to see if they would be interested in a partnership. During this step in the process, you'll discuss your marketing goals, target audience, and commission rates. While some brands have standard rates, others may negotiate.</p> \n<h3>3. Generate and assign IDs.</h3> \n<p>You have solidified your partnerships. Now it's time to get your links and codes ready to share with your affiliate(s).</p> \n<p>The only way to correctly attribute an action to a particular partner is by assigning a custom ID, code, or UTM parameter.</p> \n<p>It's important to note that while you may do this manually at first, you'll likely need to rely on a program to automate this process as you scale your business.</p> \n<h2>Top Performance Marketing Software</h2> \n<p>There are two main types of performance marketing software: those that focus on connecting advertisers with affiliate partners or publishers and those that monitor performance.

According to a <a href=\"https://thepma.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2018-PMA-Performance-Marketing-Survey.pdf\">2018 study by the Performance Marketing Association</a>, advertisers in the retail sector spent the most in performance marketing – accounting for 50% of total spend. The financial sector followed with 35%, then a steep drop off to the travel industry with a 7% spend.</p> \n<p>In terms of revenue, the sector with the highest revenue was retail at 73%, followed by travel with 14%. Industries like automotive, healthcare, and telecoms only accounted for 1% of the total performance marketing revenue in 2018.</p> \n<p>However, despite having the big spend and highest revenue percentages, the retail industry didn't offer the best ROAS. According to the report, the travel industry offered the best return with an 18:1 ratio, followed by the entertainment sector with a 15:1 ratio.</p> \n<p>Any industry can have success with performance marketing. It's all about collaborating with the right partners and setting up a robust program to reach your marketing goals.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

Plus, how you can create your own.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Brand Building Guide\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What is brand voice?</h2> \n<p>When a friend calls you, consider — beyond the name that appears on caller ID — how do you know it's her?</p> \n<p>More likely than not, you can deduce this information from how she speaks. The common phrases she uses, how she tells a story, her tone and inflection, and even what information she chooses to include (and exclude) in a given sentence all highlight her unique voice and personality.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, think about the last time you chatted with a stranger. In mere minutes, I bet you start to get a sense for their personality. Through a brief conversation, you can start to deduce whether they're outgoing or shy, serious or funny, and more.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a person's voice is synonymous with their personality, as it relates to how they communicate.</p> \n<p>And brand voice isn't much different.</p> \n<p>Brand voice is the personality your brand takes on in <em>all </em>of<em>&nbsp;</em>its<em>&nbsp;</em>communications.</p> \n<p>Brand voice is a critical factor for creating consistency across communication channels, regardless of who creates the content. For instance, brands with strong voice will sound the same on social media, email communications, and blog posts — even if three different teams create content for those channels.</p> \n<p>Good brand voice makes your brand stand out from the noise, and helps consumers remember <em>and </em>relate to your brand. This, in turn, creates stronger brand loyalty.</p> \n<p>Plus, brand voice can help attract new prospects before they even learn about your product or services.</p> \n<p>For instance, consider the humor used in MoonPie's social posts:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"MoonPie tweets, highlighting the brand's funny brand voice.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-47-44-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-47-44-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MoonPie\" style=\"font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Before I'd even purchased a MoonPie for the first time, I followed them on Twitter. Why? Because I liked the brand's voice — it made me laugh, and felt relatable.</p> \n<p>Of course, a brand voice doesn't have to be funny to be powerful. Other powerful brand voices can be inspiring, emotional, bold, casual, formal, poetic, or direct.</p> \n<p>To see this in-action, let's take a look at some impressive examples of brand voice, next.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Brand Voice Examples</h2> \n<h3><strong>1. </strong><strong><a href=\"http://spotify.com\">Spotify</a></strong></h3> \n<p>Whether you're watching a TV ad, driving past a billboard, or scrolling Spotify's social accounts, you'll see consistently funny, edgy, direct, and concise language used to develop Spotify's brand voice.</p> \n<p>For instance, take a look at this video, which is part of a Spotify advertisement campaign from 2019, 'Let the Song Play':</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kh-W7xdZMdM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>As you can see, Spotify doesn't take itself too seriously. The ad makes fun of people who get so emotionally-invested in a song that they won't resume their plans until the song ends.</p> \n<p>You'll see a similar brand voice play out on Spotify's social channels. On its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Spotify\">Twitter account</a>, for instance, the brand often posts tweets related to new music in a casual, friendly manner, like this one:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Spotify's tweet, showcasing the witty brand voice.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-46-96-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-46-96-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p>If I were to describe Spotify's brand voice as a person, I'd say she's witty, sarcastic, and up-to-date on today's pop culture references. You'll see that personality play out across all of Spotify's communication channels.</p> \n<h3><strong>2. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">Mailchimp</a></strong></h3> \n<p>For this next example, we can look at Mailchimp's Content Style Guide to derive important information related to Mailchimp's brand voice.</p> \n<p>In the Style Guide, Mailchimp writes, \"We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them. Using offbeat humor and a conversational voice, we play with language to bring joy to their work … We don't take ourselves too seriously.\"</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Mailchimp's Style Guide for brand voice.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D.png?width=624&amp;height=292&amp;name=What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"292\"></p> \n<p>Even in the Style Guide, you can hear Mailchimp's brand voice shine through. The brand consistently achieves a conversational, direct, playful voice in all its content.</p> \n<p>For instance, in this <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/resources/whats-your-persona/\">blog post</a>, the brand writes about various \"highly unscientific personas\", including the fainting goat, which links out to a hilarious video. \"When startled, its muscles stiffen up and it falls right over\", strikes the appropriate casual tone that is a staple of the brand's voice.</p> \n<p>As you can see from this example, you can evoke brand voice in subtle yet effective ways. If the blogger had instead written, \"If a goat is scared, it becomes nervous. The animal's muscles contract and it faints as a result\", the writer would've evoked a voice more aligned with a scientific journal than Mailchimp.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Mailchimp's blog post, highlighting brand voice. \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-46-33-PM.png?width=624&amp;height=460&amp;name=What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-46-33-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"460\"></p> \n<h3><strong>3. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.fentybeauty.com/\">Fenty Beauty</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>On the <a href=\"https://www.fentybeauty.com/about-fenty\">About Us page</a> for Rihanna's beauty company, it says, \"Before she was BadGalRiRi: music, fashion and beauty icon, Robyn Rihanna Fenty was a little girl in Barbados transfixed by her mother’s lipstick. The first time she experienced makeup for herself, she never looked back. Makeup became her weapon of choice for self-expression.\"</p> \n<p>It's clear, even just through this short snippet, that Fenty Beauty's voice is bold, direct, and poetic, using language like \"transfixed by her mother's lipstick\" and \"her weapon of choice for self-expression\". However, the tone is also undeniably casual — the way you might talk to your best friend.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Fenty Beauty's About Us page, showcasing a playful, witty brand voice.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-4.png?width=536&amp;name=What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 536px;\" title=\"\" width=\"536\"></p> \n<p>You'll see this voice play out across all Fenty social channels, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKSTk5rkCpM&amp;ab_channel=FentyBeautyByRihanna\">this YouTube video description</a>: \"The blur is REAL! Rihanna wanted to create a light coverage, easy-to-apply, flexible skin tint that instantly evens out your complexion and gives a flattering blurred effect. Eaze Drop, paired with Fenty Skin's HYDRA VIZOR for added SPF protection, is the perfect combo for a natural, no-makeup makeup look, or for when you want to look effortlessly put together.\"</p> \n<p>The first statement, \"The blur is REAL!\" — along with phrases like \"No-makeup makeup look\", and the shortening of the word \"combination\" — all evoke a sense of friendliness. The brand voice matches its target audience perfectly: youthful millennials and Gen-Zers who care about makeup as an opportunity for authentic expression.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/fenty%20beauty.png?width=1118&amp;name=fenty%20beauty.png\" alt=\"fenty beauty's youtube description, using casual brand voice.\" width=\"1118\" style=\"width: 1118px;\"></p> \n<h3><strong>4. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.clare.com/\">Clare Paint</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>Clare, an online paint site, has created a mature, spirited, and cheerful brand voice to evoke a breezy, girl-next-door feel to their branded content.</p> \n<p>For instance, consider the title of one of their recent blog posts, \"<a href=\"https://www.clare.com/blog/interiors/pink-walls\">6 Stylish Rooms on Instagram That Make a Strong Case For Pink Walls</a>\".</p> \n<p>The post — which uses phrases like \"millennial pink\", \"pink walls have obvious staying power\", and \"designers and DIY enthusiasts alike have embraced the playful shade with open arms\" — uses a friendly, chic, professional tone to relate to its readers while simultaneously demonstrating the brand's home decor expertise.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Clare paint's blog post, demonstrating the brand's chic, professional brand voice.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-46-76-PM.png?width=411&amp;name=What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-46-76-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 411px;\" title=\"\" width=\"411\"></p> \n<p>This voice is clear across channels.

The <em>Oh my god, I can't believe they just posted that </em>factor keeps the content fresh and exciting.</p> \n<p>Plus, the brand does a good job referencing pop culture references, like this <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/\">Mean Girls</a></em>&nbsp;reference, to highlight the brand's youthfulness.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Skittle's funny tweet, 'have you ever been personally victimized by M&amp;Ms chocolate?'\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-1.png?width=624&amp;height=380&amp;name=What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"380\"></p> \n<p>Now that we've explored five impressive examples of brand voice, let's dive into how you can create your <em>own</em> brand voice.</p> \n<h2><strong>Creating a Brand Voice</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. Start with your company's mission or value statement.</h3> \n<p>Your brand's mission or value statement can help you determine some key characteristics of your brand voice.</p> \n<p>For instance, consider <a href=\"https://agood.com/blogs/about-us/our-values\">A Good Company's Values page</a>:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"A Good Company's Values page\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-46-58-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>You'll see these values — transparency, eco-friendliness, and modern instead of traditional — embedded in every piece of content you read from A Good Company.</p> \n<p>For instance, take a look at this blog post, <a href=\"https://agood.com/blogs/stories/the-best-vintage-and-rental-apps\">Agood Recommends: The Best Second Hand and Rental Marketplaces</a>:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"a blog post from a Good Company, showing how they've used brand values to create strong brand voice.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-Apr-06-2021-03-36-46-12-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>The writing is clear, straightforward, and direct, to support the brand's transparency values. The writer takes the angle of eco-friendliness in the opinions expressed throughout the piece (i.e. \"so much stuff already exists in the world\").</p> \n<p>And, finally, there's a casual, informal tone to the voice, hinting at a company that isn't old-school and doesn't take itself too seriously (i.e. \"pick up some 'on fleek' style bargains).</p> \n<p>You'll want to consider your own values when creating a brand voice. Those values can become key characteristics of your voice.</p> \n<h3>2. Research your audience and use your buyer persona as inspiration for brand voice. &nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Your audience will be the ultimate test of whether you've created a successful brand voice. If your voice doesn't resonate with your audience, then it probably isn't the right voice.</p> \n<p>When creating a brand voice, then, it's vital you consider your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer persona</a>.</p> \n<p>What is she like? Does she like to read more formal, journalistic-style pieces, or casually skim funny memes on social media? Does she like humor in the content she consumes, or would she prefer the content be straightforward and to-the-point?</p> \n<p>Your buyer persona will influence the voice you create.</p> \n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/target-audience\">audience research</a>&nbsp;can help you determine other types of content that perform best with your audience, which is undeniably helpful when creating a strong voice. For instance, perhaps you survey your audience or use an analytics tool like Google Analytics to determine other sites your readers frequent.</p> \n<p>Figuring out what else they consume is helpful here — your voice should be different if your readers often consume Buzzfeed content, versus the <em>New York Times.</em>&nbsp;The Buzzfeed audience might prefer more casual, funny writing, while the latter probably likes more academic-style content.</p> \n<h3>3. Look at best-performing pieces and consider why they work.</h3> \n<p>If you've already been publishing content for a few months or even years, then take a look at your top-performing pieces and write down key characteristics of the voice used in those pieces.</p> \n<p>Is your top-performing piece more poetic? Does it include trends and pop-culture references? Does it dive deep into a topic and include original research to back up its claims?</p> \n<p>Ultimately, these pieces are already resonating with your audience, and it's likely (at least in part) due to voice. Take note of which aspects of the voice you feel can, and should, be replicated across your brand as a whole.</p> \n<h3>4. Make a do's and don'ts list.</h3> \n<p>Oftentimes, determining brand voice starts by asking: \"What <em>don't </em>we want our brand voice to be?\"</p> \n<p>Figuring out what you <em>don't</em>&nbsp;want your brand voice to be is a critical step in choosing the right voice for your brand.</p> \n<p>For instance, perhaps your team brainstorms the following statements:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Our brand voice is not uppity or pretentious. </em></li> \n <li><em>Our brand voice is not too serious. </em></li> \n <li><em>Our brand voice is not grandiose.</em></li> \n <li><em>Our brand voice is not unfriendly. </em></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you've taken a look at these statements, you can begin forming the antithesis to this:<em>&nbsp;</em></p> \n<p><em>Our brand voice is down-to-earth and authentic. It's funny and casual. It's humble. And it's helpful. </em></p> \n<h3>5. If necessary, use a third-party agency to determine brand voice.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/connect/content-solutions/brandvoice/\">Forbes' BrandVoice</a> is a media partnership program that helps brands reach and resonate with their audiences through expert consultancy and direct access to Forbes audiences.</p> \n<p>Take a look at how <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/colehaan/changemakers/\">Cole Haan worked with Forbes</a>&nbsp;to create content related to style, arts, travel, social impact, and more. Each piece uses a unique voice to target the intended audience for that category.</p> \n<p>Consider the voice used for a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/colehaan/2019/09/20/5-tips-for-having-the-best-staycation/?sh=4303ebb56655\">staycation, travel-related piece:</a></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cole%20haan%20blog%20post%20on%20staycations.png?width=341&amp;name=cole%20haan%20blog%20post%20on%20staycations.png\" alt=\"cole haan blog post on staycations\" width=\"341\" style=\"width: 341px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>... Versus the voice used for a style-related piece <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/colehaan/2019/08/15/as-artisans-abroad-struggle-for-consistent-pay-a-home-goods-company-puts-them-on-the-payroll/?sh=606383b480d8\">that highlights a sustainable home goods company:</a></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cole%20haan%20blog%20post%20on%20home%20goods%20store.png?width=341&amp;name=cole%20haan%20blog%20post%20on%20home%20goods%20store.png\" alt=\"cole haan blog post on home goods store\" width=\"341\" style=\"width: 341px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">As you can see, different voices are necessary for reaching and resonating with these very different audiences. And Cole Haan, with the help of Forbes' BrandVoice program, is able to use both.</p> \n<p>If you're struggling to create a unique brand voice or you need to use different voices for different aspects of your business (like a Sales blog versus a Marketing blog), consider using a program like BrandVoice or a third-party content marketing agency to hone in on a voice that makes the most sense for your business.</p> \n<h3>6. Create a communications document so all of your content is aligned on brand voice.</h3> \n<p>Once you've created your brand voice, you'll want to ensure your entire company is aligned in using that voice when creating any marketing materials.</p> \n<p>If your company only uses internal writers, consider creating a training course for new writers to learn how to write for your brand. If you work with external guest contributors as well, you'll want to make public-facing guest contributor guidelines to ensure <em>all</em>&nbsp;your writing captures the appropriate voice.</p> \n<h3>7. Fill out a brand voice template with 3-5 core voice characteristics.</h3> \n<p>Use a table to formalize your process. Write down the 3-5 core characteristics you've determined are important for your brand's voice, and how your writers can use these traits in their writing.</p> \n<p>This step is important for translating ideas into action — <em>how </em>can your writers create a \"humble, authentic voice\" in their writing? Give some examples or tactical advice to make it easy for your brand voice to come through in all of your content, regardless of byline.</p> \n<p>To explore what a template will look like in-practice, let's take a look at the following brand voice template — along with a downloadable version, so you can get started right away. &nbsp;</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Brand Voice Template</h2> \n<p><img alt=\"Brand Voice Template\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-2.png?width=624&amp;height=376&amp;name=What%20Brand%20Voice%20Is,%20and%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%5B+%20Examples%5D-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"376\"></p> \n<p>Looking to make one of these for your own brand? <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y64CSw32I1wqUYO6or-h7GmBBQ_4Q4yhNpJWwrHYwjY/copy?usp=sharing\">Click here for the blank Google Sheet template</a> so you can copy-and-paste your own brand voice characteristics, fill out the remaining cells, and send along to your team.

Practices]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-ad-not-approved","description":"<p>Facebook ads can generate awareness, bring in leads, and convert prospects … but only you can get them approved.</p> \n<p>In our 2020 \"Not Another State of Marketing Report,\" we found that <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">more than one in three marketers listed Facebook ads</a>&nbsp;as their best performer in terms of ROI. That's a higher ratio than Google Paid Search or Instagram. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Over 3 million businesses used Facebook's advertising platform in 2020 and 78% of American consumers say they've <a href=\"https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/internet-trends-report-2018\">discovered products on Facebook</a>&nbsp;in the past. Whether you're already one of them, or if you're just getting started on Facebook advertising, understanding Facebook's ad approval process is paramount to success.</p> \n<p>Below, we identify the common causes for rejection, what you can do if your ad is rejected, and some best practices to follow to ensure success.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=0e17c46b-0ab9-43a4-8ddb-bdf86aa56e78&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Facebook Advertising Checklist\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0e17c46b-0ab9-43a4-8ddb-bdf86aa56e78.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Get a Facebook Ad Approved</h2> \n<p>In theory, Facebook's approval process is straightforward:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads\">Submit an ad</a>&nbsp;that adheres to Facebook's advertising guidelines. New and edited ads will both go through the same review process.</li> \n <li>Facebook reviews ads using a combination of bots and manual reviewers.</li> \n <li>Your ad is either approved or denied. You'll be notified when the decision is made, and ads that were approved will go live.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>However, the review process in step two can seem like a bit of a black box. What points do Facebook's approval team take into account while doing reviews? How long will this process take? Let's take a closer look at the review process, and what you can do to ensure your ad makes it through.</p> \n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How long does Facebook's ad review process take? </span></h2> \n<p>Most ads are reviewed within 24 hours, according to Facebook's Advertising Policy, and you'll receive an email or notification with the results of the review. However, it's not uncommon for ad review to take up to a few days. That's why it's important to plan ahead and try to follow the rules.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>New ad campaigns tend to get reviewed for longer. However, if you have a long history of publishing ads successfully, you'll see your review time shorten.</li> \n <li>Ads are manually reviewed, so if more people are submitting ads for review, there can be a longer wait time. Expect to wait longer during holiday seasons.</li> \n <li>If you've submitted an ad to go live as soon as possible, it will be published as soon as the review process is complete and the ad is approved.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Why was my Facebook ad not approved? </span></h2> \n<p>There are many reasons why Facebook rejects an ad, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Selling products not allowed on Facebook (tobacco, illegal products or services, weapons, etc …).</li> \n <li>Making sensational claims, using click-bait, or promoting misinformation.</li> \n <li>Ads not following Facebook's advertising guidelines, such as branding requirements and text restrictions.</li> \n <li>Disruptive or low quality content that negatively impacts a Facebook user's experience.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Fortunately, you don't need to figure out the reason for the rejection yourself. If your ad is rejected, you can review the reason for the rejection and either request another review or edit your ad to fit within Facebook's policies. To review your ad status, or request an appeal, head to the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/accountquality\">Account Quality page</a>&nbsp;in your Facebook account. &nbsp;</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Four Common Reasons for Rejected Facebook Ads</h2> \n<p>A number of Facebook's advertising policies can be confusing at first glance. Let's break down these common reasons for rejections to understand how you can get your ad approved faster.</p> \n<h3>1. There's too much text on the image.</h3> \n<p>Facebook's ad policy states that your image may not have text over 20% of the area. While it may be tempting to try and fit more information into your image, remember that a picture is worth a thousand words.</p> \n<p>Images are more engaging than text-based ads and result in higher click-through rates. Even if it wasn't a Facebook policy, we'd recommend reducing the amount of text on your ads.</p> \n<h3>2. Landing pages are not functional.</h3> \n<p>Your ad copy is not the only thing that matters when it comes to getting your ad approved. Facebook also examines the landing page to which you're sending people. If the landing page is substantially different from what you're advertising, you can expect your ad to be rejected.</p> \n<p>Resist the temptation to be overly clever and pull a bait-and-switch with your ads (i.e., advertising to lose the dead weight and linking to a divorce attorney's site). Your landing page URL should also be reflective of the copy on the page.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ad%20copy%20should%20reflect%20your%20landing%20page.png?width=840&amp;name=ad%20copy%20should%20reflect%20your%20landing%20page.png\" alt=\"ad copy should reflect your landing page\" width=\"840\" style=\"width: 840px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/\">source</a></p> \n<p>Finally, make sure your landing page is functional. If customers have to click through pop-ups to get to the content, or there are dead links on the page, Facebook will potentially deny your ad.</p> \n<h3>3. Ad copy is overly personal.</h3> \n<p>Wait, isn't personalization what customers want? Yes, but only when they have expressly given the permission for their data to be used. When an unknown advertiser (a third party) uses data, it can seem creepy or overreaching.</p> \n<p>A study published in Harvard Business Review found that when \"unacceptable, third-party sharing had occurred, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/01/ads-that-dont-overstep\">concerns about privacy outweighed people's appreciation for ad personalization</a>.\" In other words, users don't feel comfortable when advertisers seem to have access to more personal data than they have directly disclosed with them.</p> \n<p>This is one of the reasons Facebook won't approve ads that directly reference a user's personal information. According to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/personal_attributes\">Facebook's policies,</a>&nbsp;\"ads must not contain content that asserts or implies personal attributes.\"</p> \n<p>For example, ad copy stating a user's age or sexual orientation would not be allowed. While you may want to attract single 20-somethings to your hip new bar, you wouldn't be able to say \"<em>Hey single lady! Your 20s are the time to live it up. Visit O-Town Pub tonight!</em>\" However, you can still narrow your ad audience to females in their 20s.</p> \n<p>Yes, you should still try to direct your advertisements to your target audience. But avoid the \"creepy\" factor.</p> \n<h3>4. Facebook's brand guidelines weren't followed.</h3> \n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/use_of_brand_assets/brand_reference\">offers a number of guidelines about how to refer to them</a>. In general, ads should avoid suggesting they are related to Facebook, adding the Facebook logo, or making Facebook branding the main focus of the ad. Additionally;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Don't pluralize Facebook or abbreviate it as \"FB\".</li> \n <li>Don't use the \"f\" or Facebook logos in place of the word \"Facebook\" in ad copy.</li> \n <li>Don't change Facebook's brand colors, even for animation purposes.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Four Best Practices for Facebook Ads</h2> \n<p>Creating an ad that will perform well goes a long way to creating an ad that will get approved. Facebook wants its users to have a positive experience when interacting with ads.</p> \n<p>If users can discover new products and services through Facebook ads, they'll continue to engage with the platform. Following these <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33319/10-examples-of-facebook-ads-that-actually-work-and-why.aspx\">best practices for Facebook Ads</a>&nbsp;will ensure a positive experience for your visitors, along with a strong conversion rate.</p> \n<h3>1. Think visually.</h3> \n<p>Facebook ads compete for your audience's attention alongside all the other posts on Facebook: pictures of your friends' kids, amazing pictures of nature, and tons of pet pictures. How is your ad going to catch the attention of your target customer? It has to be visually appealing.</p> \n<p>Check out the below video from <a href=\"https://chive.com/\">Chive</a>, which sells plant pots. The big green plant catches your eye right away, while the motion keeps your attention. This is a great, simple but visually striking advertisement.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 476px; max-height: 476px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 100%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FChiveInc%2Fvideos%2F2796852697231254%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=476\" width=\"476\" height=\"476\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h3>2. Have a clear call to action.</h3> \n<p>What do you want your audience to do next? Should they like your Facebook Page? Download a free template? Sign up for a newsletter? Having a direct call to action will promote more engagement. Tell your customers what to do next, then make it very easy for them to follow through.</p> \n<p>According to AdRoll, adding a call-to-action button<a href=\"https://blog.nextroll.com/best-practices/newsflash-facebook-cta-buttons-really-work\">&nbsp;boosts click-through rate by 2.85 times</a>. The advertisement below is taking advantage of Facebook's call-to-action buttons by inviting users to sign up for a free virtual event.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/amazon%20web%20services%20facebook%20ad.png?width=840&amp;name=amazon%20web%20services%20facebook%20ad.png\" alt=\"amazon web services facebook ad\" width=\"840\" style=\"width: 840px;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Keep it relevant.</h3> \n<p>With <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-pixel\">Facebook Pixels and extensive ad targeting options available</a>, there is no reason to promote irrelevant content or offers. The best offers are hyper-targeted to your ideal customer, based on their past site activity and their likes. For example, this advertisement for plant propagation decor is very relevant to me, because I've purchased from online plant nurseries before.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Planterry%20Store%20Facebook%20ad.png?width=794&amp;name=Planterry%20Store%20Facebook%20ad.png\" alt=\"Planterry Store Facebook ad\" width=\"794\" style=\"width: 794px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Provide value.</h3> \n<p>Why should a customer click through to your landing page? Do you have information they need? A product that is going to solve their problems? Or are you offering a deal?

But whether your event is online or in-person over the year ahead, event branding is essential to create a memorable experience for attendees.</p> \n<p>When I joined <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/max.html\">Adobe MAX</a>&nbsp;2020, for example, the virtual event felt as close to an in-person experience as possible. The opportunities to learn from accomplished speakers energized me and made me feel connected to the company.</p> \n<p>That's no surprise, because <a href=\"https://www.eventmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/eventtrack2018execsumm.pdf\">91% of people have positive feelings about a brand after joining events</a>. But memorable experiences don't happen randomly — they're the result of thoughtful event branding.</p> \n<p>Whether you're planning an upcoming virtual conference or outdoor meet-up, it's important to consider the branding behind your event. You want to consider your company's values and essence, yet design a unique, event-only brand that stands out.</p> \n<p>To host an event that wows your audience and has a real impact on your business, here's what to keep in mind. First … well, what is it?</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download free resources for executing your best event yet. [Free Kit]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What is event branding?</h2> \n<p>Like a company brand, event branding is made up of many elements including a logo, website, app, marketing materials, stage design, speakers, sponsors, and event swag.</p> \n<p>Some elements are similar to an organization's brand, but the event brand must stand on its own. Think about how branded events — like <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/\">Dreamforce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.inbound.com/\">INBOUND</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.29rooms.com/\">29Rooms</a>&nbsp;— are separate yet related to the companies hosting the events. This is possible with a combination of onsite branding (i.e., banners, booths, stage design, and swag) and digital branding (i.e., website, imagery, and marketing).</p> \n<p>It's important to note that event branding is a part of <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/resources/event-marketing\">event marketing</a>&nbsp;but requires its own skill sets and strategies.</p> \n<p>The key to a well-attended event is to make your branding cohesive and recognizable, because a consistent brand presentation has been seen to <a href=\"https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/resources/report/the-impact-of-brand-consistency\">increase revenue by 33%</a>. Beyond a thoughtful branding plan, you need to promote the event, create memorable moments for attendees, and know how to gauge success. If you can make all of that happen, you'll reap the rewards of a well-branded event.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Benefits of Event Branding</h2> \n<p>Think of the best event you've attended. You can likely picture the people you met, the food, the speakers, and even the after-parties. Branding an event shapes how everyone involved—speakers, attendees, employees, and sponsors—remembers the experience.</p> \n<p>For example, one session in the Adobe MAX event showed me how to use new features in my Lightroom mobile app. I only learned that skill because Adobe selected speakers who provided value for the audience. They also had a moderator who shared immediate takeaways. And they sent me a follow-up email with the recorded session in case I needed to refresh my memory afterward.</p> \n<p>I now follow that particular speaker on Instagram and even renewed my Adobe subscription after joining the event. Yes, I knowingly fell into <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel\">the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p>The point is, a branded event can help generate leads, build loyalty and credibility, and offer support. Attendees are more willing to buy into your brand promise (and eventually, into your product or service) if you provide a valuable experience.</p> \n<p>So, if you do your job well, people will have a good experience — which generates positive emotions — and will become customers or advocates for your brand.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">5 Event Branding Ideas</h2> \n<p>Creating a unique brand that resonates with your audience is about crafting a story that you and your attendees will tell. That's why successful event branding carries one message throughout every touchpoint. For inspiration on how to tie your event together, look through these examples of well-planned events around the world.</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Website</strong>&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A website is the hub of an event, so it needs to set the stage for the brand. This is the place to share information on the event's purpose, dates, registration, speakers, sponsors, merchandise, and FAQs.</p> \n<p>It should be easy to navigate and make people excited to sign up. This is exactly what the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>&nbsp;website does; It's straightforward, yet effective. And the no-nonsense branding is aligned with the modern style of innovative tech companies.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/techcrunch%20disrupt.png?width=594&amp;name=techcrunch%20disrupt.png\" alt=\"techcrunch disrupt\" width=\"594\" style=\"width: 594px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">source</a></p> \n<h3><strong>2. Marketing</strong></h3> \n<p>Every event planner's nightmare is lackluster attendance. To make sure your event is buzzing, put time into marketing the event with social media posts, emails, and ads. Check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/event-marketing\">The Ultimate Guide to Event Marketing</a>&nbsp;to dive into the details.</p> \n<p>For event branding, ensure your messaging and imagery are cohesive across all channels. You want to give your audience multiple opportunities to learn about, sign up for, and share your event.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/110546431/Follow20-design-Festival?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cevent%20design\">#follow20 Design Festival</a>&nbsp;is a great example of how consistent branding can help people recognize an event both online and in-person.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/follow20%20Design%20Festival.png?width=820&amp;name=follow20%20Design%20Festival.png\" alt=\"follow20 Design Festival\" width=\"820\" style=\"width: 820px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/you.should.follow.us/\">source</a></p> \n<h3><strong>3. Design</strong></h3> \n<p>A solid marketing plan is nothing without consistent design. This includes colors, logos, typography, photography, graphics, swag, posters, and stage design. The studio <a href=\"http://hybrid-design.com/\">Hybrid Design</a>&nbsp;perfectly coordinated <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/86801021/Pinterest-Knit-Con-Event-Branding?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cevent%20branding\">Pinterest's Knit Con 2019</a>&nbsp;through vibrant, thoughtful touches that tied the values and creativity of the Pinterest team together.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pinterest%20knit%20con%202019.png?width=820&amp;name=pinterest%20knit%20con%202019.png\" alt=\"pinterest knit con 2019\" width=\"820\" style=\"width: 820px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/86801021/Pinterest-Knit-Con-Event-Branding?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cevent%20branding\">source</a></p> \n<h3><strong>4. Swag</strong></h3> \n<p>Event swag may seem unnecessary, with virtual events taking over in-person meet-ups. But that's not entirely true. Promotional Products Association International (PPAI) estimates that promotional products are the most effective form of advertising across all generations, and <a href=\"https://www.ppai.org/media/2465/ppb2017junetippingthescalearticle.pdf\">over 80% of promotional products are used for more than a year</a>.</p> \n<p>While branded products have been held under the fire for causing environmental harm, unsustainable swag isn't the only option these days. Digital gift cards, online workout class passes, free software, and charitable donations are all environmentally responsible giveaways.</p> \n<p>The trick is to find swag that suits your brand, so don't shop for stress balls and stickers if you're hosting a tech conference. <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/\">SXSW</a>&nbsp;is a good example of how to choose merch that's reusable and relevant to the event brand.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sxsw-1.png?width=832&amp;name=sxsw-1.png\" alt=\"sxsw-1\" width=\"832\" style=\"width: 832px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/attend/?utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_term=sxsw&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_campaign=SXSW+2019+-+General+Search+Remarketing&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_ad=504112048487&amp;hsa_acc=5629257571&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-305750455420&amp;hsa_cam=12401460202&amp;hsa_grp=118093064157&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_kw=sxsw&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA-aGCBhCwARIsAHDl5x_NAOVGwpP1EqvFZq7z25p_8BjFKEkO8MY3R8KBAcVQmbIGFrkiY1QaAg4EEALw_wcB\">source</a></p> \n<h3><strong>5. Videos</strong></h3> \n<p>Video marketing has been on the rise for the past few years, and the pandemic pushed the need for video further than ever. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data\">Wyzowl</a>&nbsp;found that&nbsp;the pandemic has impacted how much video content 68% of consumers watched online, with 96% reporting an increase.</p> \n<p>For event branding, the INBOUND video shown below strikes a balance between sharing event recaps, highlighting speaker sessions, and emphasizing the brand's values.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LacPKPSgcpc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Outdoor Event Branding</h2> \n<p>Outdoor events can be a good alternative to virtual events. This type of event is ideal for networking meet-ups, company picnics, award ceremonies, or festivals. And if you take the proper safety precautions, attendees will feel secure and enjoy the hard work you put into the experience.</p> \n<p>There are a few things to consider when planning outdoor event branding. Depending on the season and location, you may need to weather-proof the event. Signs and banners need to stand up to conditions, and people need a place to escape the heat, chill, or rain.</p> \n<p>Take advantage of these outdoor quirks to create unique branding moments. Set up plenty of spaces for small groups to gather that have fun opportunities for people to interact with your brand. To keep people socially distanced, consider branded floor decals to mark proper distance or give groups different colored wristbands to encourage people to stay together.</p> \n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.seltzerland.com/\">Seltzerland</a>&nbsp;held successful outdoor events in 2020 thanks to creative thinking and smart branding. Seltzerland organizer Kate Levenstien petitioned to move the events to recently-opened golf courses.</p> \n<p>She followed local COVID restrictions, brought dozens of beverage companies on board, ordered swag, and did test runs to check the safety of each space on the course. The result? Nine successful outdoor events across the US during a year of rolling lockdowns.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Seltzerland%20Event.png?width=471&amp;name=Seltzerland%20Event.png\" alt=\"Seltzerland Event\" width=\"471\" style=\"width: 471px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image <a href=\"https://www.seltzerland.com/\">source</a></p> \n<p>As you plan your next event, remember that event branding is more than a logo and company colors. Designing a thoughtful brand for your event will not only ensure it resonates with your company, but it will also make it easier to engage your audience and let everyone leave with valuable information. There's nothing better for next year's attendance than a memorable experience everyone wants to share.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Event Marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fevent-branding&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 12:27:48 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1.png","linkMd5":"a747e7020d951ecdd1a37a6db61014be","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn88@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-43-35-425_6ca0430bfb5ec4d1.webp","destWidth":472,"destHeight":19,"sourceBytes":4523,"destBytes":4712,"author":"Katrina Kirsch","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn88@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-43-35-425_6ca0430bfb5ec4d1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/techcrunch%20disrupt.png?width=594&name=techcrunch%20disrupt.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn65@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-28-818_b315d79db73a5881.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/follow20%20Design%20Festival.png?width=820&name=follow20%20Design%20Festival.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn30@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-28-790_d09d5b4d5d2e177d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pinterest%20knit%20con%202019.png?width=820&name=pinterest%20knit%20con%202019.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn53@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-28-709_362d3481d3908def.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sxsw-1.png?width=832&name=sxsw-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn37@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-28-931_e399811053eb7e83.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Seltzerland%20Event.png?width=471&name=Seltzerland%20Event.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn81@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-29-872_069cab59a7b16380.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn14@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-28-759_31f5fd92c8680d09.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fevent-branding&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn67@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-29-269_8a6837771884703a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245815006},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:35","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:35","title":"Multi-Touch Attribution and Models: A Complete Guide","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/multi-touch-attribution","description":"<p>Today's buyer's journey includes a number of interactions across various touchpoints and channels. There's rarely a conversion of sale that occurs based off a single interaction.</p>  \n<p>Rather, conversions and sales often stem from a mix of interactions via a variety of sources such as blog articles, social media posts, webinars, in-person events, conversations with reps, content on your website, email marketing campaigns, and more. All of these touchpoints play a role in getting your customers to convert.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5da9abe2-cf1b-496c-bd78-b97b386af0ac&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Start building your audience, for free, with Marketing Hub.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5da9abe2-cf1b-496c-bd78-b97b386af0ac.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Attribution allows you to give credit for conversions to those marketing touchpoints and channels throughout the buyer’s journey. Multi-touch attribution takes this a step further.</p> \n<h2>Multi-Touch Attribution</h2> \n<p>In this blog post, we’ll cover the definition of multi-touch attribution, what makes it unique from other types of attribution, and multi-touch attribution models. Let’s get started.</p> \n<h3>What is multi-touch attribution?</h3> \n<p>Multi-touch attribution, which may also be referred to as fractional attribution, is how you determine the value of each touchpoint throughout the customer journey that results in a conversion.</p> \n<p>In other words, it's when credit for a conversion is given to every touchpoint that a customer experienced throughout the buyer's journey.</p> \n<h4>Why is multi-touch attribution important?</h4> \n<p>The reason multi-touch attribution is so important is that it allows you to pinpoint all of the channels that contribute to a conversion and which of those channels have the most impact on a conversion. It gives you a clear picture of how your channels and touchpoints influence every conversion.</p> \n<p>This is valuable information that you can use to enhance those touchpoints for future prospects to improve the customer experience and buyer’s journey. It shows you exactly how different touchpoints and channels work together to influence deals on an individual level.</p> \n<p>You can also use this information to better understand what matters most to your target audience throughout the buyer’s journey and which aspects of the customer experience are most influential when they’re making a decision.</p> \n<p>You may have heard about other types of attribution before, such as first-touch and last-touch. Let's talk about what makes multi-touch attribution unique next.</p> \n<h3>Multi-Touch Attribution vs. First-Touch Attribution vs. Last-Touch Attribution</h3> \n<p>Multi-touch attribution is unique from first-touch and last-touch attribution because it doesn’t attribute a conversion to the first or last marketing touchpoint a customer has prior to converting.</p> \n<p>For example, say a HubSpot customer read a blog post, attended INBOUND, interacted with a social media post, and then became a customer.</p> \n<p>First-touch attribution would conclude that the blog post that the customer read gets the credit for their conversion whereas last-touch attribution would give the credit to the social media post they interacted with. Meanwhile, multi-touch attribution would consider all of these touchpoints and assign credit to each of them.</p> \n<p>Meaning, multi-touch attribution is unique because it takes <em>all</em> touchpoints into consideration and then assigns credit to each of those touchpoints based on the amount of influence it had a customer’s decision to convert. First and last-touch attribution — which may also be referred to as single-touch attribution — do not. These methods feel slightly outdated when compared to multi-touch attribution because they don’t account for the many touchpoints and channels that exist for prospects and customers to engage with.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>Multi-Touch Attribution Models</h3> \n<p>There are a number of attribution models that you can use to determine which touchpoints are the most important in the buyer’s journey — and different multi-touch attribution models weigh the multiple touchpoints in different ways.</p> \n<p>Here are four of the most common multi-touch attribution models to help you get started.</p> \n<h4>1. Linear Attribution</h4> \n<p>A linear attribution model, also known as an even-weighting attribution model, gives equal credit for a conversion to every touchpoint in the buyer's journey. This can be considered the \"standard\" when it comes to multi-touch attribution models.</p> \n<h5>Who should use linear attribution?</h5> \n<p>Linear attribution is great if your prospects are often in the consideration phase of the buyer's journey for an extended period of time because it shows you the impact that <em>all</em> of your content and messaging has during that extended phase.</p> \n<p>It's also ideal if you want to know the ways that your touchpoints work together to influence a deal or if you're new to multi-touch attribution and don't have a baseline understanding of how your touchpoints tend to do among your audience.</p> \n<h4>2. Time Decay Attribution</h4> \n<p>A time-decay attribution model is when you organize your touchpoints based on their percent influence on a conversion so that the least-influential touchpoint (with the lowest percentage) is first and the most-influential touchpoint (with the greatest percentage) is last.</p> \n<h5>Who should use time decay attribution?</h5> \n<p>Time decay attribution is ideal if you're measuring the success of short-term touchpoints like campaigns.</p> \n<h4>3. U-Shaped Attribution</h4> \n<p>A U-shaped attribution model, also known as a bathtub model, gives the first and last touchpoints in the buyer's journey a higher percentage of credit than the touchpoints in the middle.</p> \n<h5>Who should use u-shaped attribution?</h5> \n<p>U-shaped attribution is ideal if your team wants to focus on the impact of the first and last of your multiple touchpoints. There's less emphasis on touchpoints that support the middle stages of the buyer's journey.</p> \n<h4>4. W-Shaped Attribution</h4> \n<p>W-shaped multi-touch attribution gives credit to the first and last touchpoints in the buyer's journey as well as gives value to the touchpoints that occur in the middle of the buyer's journey. Then, all remaining touchpoints are assigned equal credit.</p> \n<h5>Who should use w-shaped attribution?</h5> \n<p>W-shaped attribution is helpful if you want to understand which touchpoints actually convert leads but also identify the touchpoints that encourage customers to engage and continue to move through the buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>In addition to the four multi-touch attribution models above, you can also create customize your multi-touch attribution model using <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/categories/attribution\">attribution software</a>.</p> \n<p>Multi-touch attribution software — like <a href=\"https://www.wickedreports.com/\">Wicked Reports</a> — has the power to make the process of identifying which of your marketing touchpoints are succeeding or failing among your prospects simple.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-07%20at%2011-23-59%20PM-jpg.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-04-07%20at%2011-23-59%20PM-jpg.jpeg\" alt=\"wicked reports marketing attribution software example\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.wickedreports.com/\"><em>Source</em></a></p> \n<p>In fact, Wicked Reports gives you a complete view of how customers interact with your brand and tracks incoming clicks against your CRM and sales data so you can identify the most important clicks in relation to your team's unique marketing goals.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pro Tip: <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/analytics-data/wicked-reports\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Seamlessly integrate Wicked Reports with your HubSpot CRM platform</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span></span></p> \n<h2>Use Multi-Touch Attribution</h2> \n<p>Multi-touch attribution is a powerful process that marketers can use to identify the various factors that influenced a purchase decision for a customer.

Read on and find out.</p> \n<h3>Consumers want videos that reflect their daily life.</h3> \n<p>If 2020 showed marketers anything, it was the necessity for agility and authenticity.</p> \n<p>Every marketer had to shift their priorities and deliver marketing collateral that reflected the time we were all living through.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/watch-youtube-on-tv/\">YouTube data from July 2019 to July 2020</a> shows a 215% increase in daily uploads for content with \"self-care\" in the title. From the viewer's side, TV screen watch time went up over 180% for videos relating to well-being, such as fitness, meditation, and yoga.</p> \n<p>Now, in 2021, consumers are still seeking out content that reflects their current state of mind.</p> \n<p>This isn't to say that your brand should start a \"30 Days of Yoga\" series. It's to highlight how closely tied current events are to the type of content we consume. If you stay in tune with how your audience is feeling and the type of content they're seeking out, you can embed it into your YouTube strategy.</p> \n<p>\"Viewers really want content that not only educates them but also engages them. Our new style is putting big stock in the authenticity and personality of its presenters,\" said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamal-meneide/\">Jamal Meneide</a>, associate video producer/editor and on-screen talent for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeuau7DLrg7zlAjxxDbdww\">HubSpot's YouTube Channel</a>.</p> \n<p>Brands must now pay attention to the social climate and general consumer feelings, and incorporate these elements into the content.</p> \n<p>Not sure how to keep your finger on the pulse? Jump to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-trends#trends\">this section</a> to learn how to research YouTube trends.</p> \n<h3>Short-form video is growing in popularity.</h3> \n<p>In September 2020, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-shorts\">YouTube launched \"Shorts\"</a> in India, a new short-form video platform on YouTube. It's now making Shorts available in the US, as of March 2021.</p> \n<p>Similar to other <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/short-form-video-trends\">short-form platforms</a>, videos on Shorts are formatted vertically to be viewed on a phone. Although it's still in beta, users can create 15-second clips, edit them with several tools and add music from YouTube's music library.</p> \n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/youtube-shorts-launching-in-usa-in-march/396276/\">Search Engine Journal article</a>, Shorts already gained steam, gaining over 3.5 billion daily views. But why would YouTube, a platform known for long-form content invest in this strategy? Meneide has a theory.</p> \n<p>\"YouTube is trying to compete with TikTok, which is evident in their play to introduce 'Shorts.' For a time, it felt like there was a pendulum swing toward really long, unedited content,\" said Meneide.</p> \n<p>\"While this is still prevalent,\" he adds, \"it seems like we've swung back the other way with short to mid-length content really killing it. Viewers want easily consumable, entertaining content that won't be as demanding on their time.\"</p> \n<p>This is an opportunity for brands to experiment with short-form content on YouTube and see what audiences are responding to.</p> \n<p>One strategy is using Shorts to create teasers for your upcoming videos or create condensed, shareable versions of your long-form videos.</p> \n<h3>But long-form videos aren't going anywhere.</h3> \n<p>Even with the push toward shorter videos, consumers still enjoy the traditional long-form approach.</p> \n<p>In June 2020, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/video-streaming-wars/\">YouTube reported</a> that 46% of survey respondents said they were more likely to watch videos over 20 minutes long than they were six months ago.</p> \n<p>Some YouTubers creators credit long-form video content for their engagement rates, and they've got data on their side.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.pixability.com/insights-reports/2019-qsr-study/\">A 2019 Pixability study</a> found that branded videos over 10 minutes long had higher engagement than shorter videos.</p> \n<p>But length won't be enough to keep your audience's attention.</p> \n<p>\"Driving music and animation also play a big part in building engagement. Whenever you see animation as a viewer, you know it's either reinforcing a key concept or adding to a joke,\" said Meneide.</p> \n<p>\"In either case, you've been delighted by that extra visual we decided to throw in. With music, we can shift the tone and mood of a video – from driving hip hop beats, to chill jazz.\"</p> \n<p>He adds that music creates a sonic bed for the viewer to situate themselves on, inviting the audience to lean in as you speed things up or sit back and relax as you slow things down.</p> \n<p>\"These kinds of stylistic and production choices are ones that many large channels on YouTube have decided to make,\" Meneide said. \"While content with a more 'homemade' feeling still crushes it, there is also an audience who wants to see well-produced, highly engaging content.\"</p> \n<h3>Marketers will start leveraging audio ads<span style=\"color: #434343; font-size: 14px;\">.</span></h3> \n<p>In November 2020, YouTube introduced audio ads, a new way for brands to reach consumers.</p> \n<p>It was a surprising announcement, given that the platform is known for video content. However, according to a <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/video/music-industry-changes/\">Think With Google article</a>, over two billion people go to YouTube for music.</p> \n<p>The article also reported a 100% increase in watch time for live music performance between July 2019 and July 2020. This sets the stage for marketers to include YouTube as an ad platform for their audio content.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How To Research YouTube Trends</h2> \n<p>We've covered a few YouTube trends for 2021, but marketers need to know how to identify trends as they come.</p> \n<p>\"On the HubSpot YouTube team, we're always looking at trends, which we corroborate with monthly search volume and keyword research to help define our content strategy,\" Meneide said. \"We want to serve our audience content that they're looking for when they're looking for it, and being sensitive to when a topic bubbles up is key to the process.\"</p> \n<p>Your first resource is <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/\">Google Trends,</a> a free online resource that is updated with real-time data on the popularity of certain topics and search terms on YouTube.</p> \n<p>You can also rely on tools like <a href=\"https://vidiq.com/\">VidIQ</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=DChcSEwi6w7_wyc7vAhUR8cAKHQ92BXYYABAAGgJpbQ&amp;ae=2&amp;sig=AOD64_1K2n1Uc3Jz6rZSGHIuljtSRdTlWQ&amp;q&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjl17Xwyc7vAhVLIqwKHSQ2C70Q0Qx6BAgHEAE\">TubeBuddy</a> to determine which ideas are worth pursuing. A good rule of thumb, according to Meneide is asking what big \"how\" or \"why\" questions you can answer for your viewers.</p> \n<p>Then, you have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht\">keyword research </a>– this tells you what consumers are searching for and if it's worth your time and resources.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say your brand wants to cover the latest tech apps in your next video. You go to Google Keyword Planner and find out that it has a monthly search volume of about 100. This may indicate that while there is some interest, it's not high enough to warrant a whole video.</p> \n<p>It's also important to look at the news and see what topics are trending. However, know the difference between something that's just in the news cycle and a trend worth incorporating into your YouTube strategy.</p> \n<p>One way to decipher between the two is asking, \"<em>How far does this reach, and will it matter in a few weeks or months?\"</em></p> \n<p>\"Hopping onto news can be just as explosive for growth or your marketing strategy as trends, but makes it a bit harder when you're always relying on the latest, 'hottest' news piece to inform your content strategy,\" Meneide said. \"By focusing on longtail trends, you can ride out a wave of sustained interest in a topic, rather than capturing what could potentially be a fleeting interest.\"</p> \n<p>As we navigate through this year, more trends will likely pop up and might inform your YouTube strategy. What's most important is being flexible and knowing when something is worth exploring further.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png\" /></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-trends&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png","linkMd5":"0bb8c63dd1d1045ee307d7d9a828f46e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-35-768_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","destWidth":625,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6230,"destBytes":9478,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-35-768_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn25@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-28-771_61f66f8328bd53cd.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-trends&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-29-273_ae4e4d2f95da19b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245815007},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:35","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:35","title":"What Marketing Leaders Are Investing in This Year","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-investment-trends","description":"<p>In an ideal world, marketers would have limitless budgets to invest in experimental initiatives and new programs.

Not only to changes within their industry but also to global challenges, which has proven to be more critical during the current pandemic.</p> \n<p>Marketers say that the main issues to reacting at speed are developing unique, creative content at a fast pace and adapting quickly to trends.</p> \n<p>They say they'll combat this issue by taking stock of their current content and coming up with an action plan for future adaptations, interviewing their audience about their struggles, restructuring teams, and simply being ready to making changes when issues arise, even at a moment's notice.</p> \n<h3>Investing in Marketing Technology</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://welcomesoftware.com/insights/top-martech-trends-2021/#:~:text=As%20remote%20work%20becomes%20an,in%20the%20next%2012%20months.\">60%</a> of marketers indicated that they are set to increase their marketing technology spending in the next 12 months.

One of the ways they want to see this represented in businesses is diversity marketing.</p> \n<p>It's an effective practice for marketers to commit to, especially considering that people are more likely to consider a product after seeing an ad they think is diverse or inclusive, and <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of-marketing/management-and-culture/diversity-and-inclusion/thought-leadership-marketing-diversity-inclusion/\">64%</a> actually take action after seeing an ad they believed to be diverse and inclusive.</p> \n<p>Thus, marketers will make a continued and improved effort to focus on diversity marketing in 2021 and be representative of the communities they serve that drive their revenue and keep their businesses afloat.</p> \n<p>However, in the same vein, it's even more critical that businesses are genuine about the diversity measures they take. Consumers can see through the fluff, and a recent survey found that <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2020-06/2020%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Specl%20Rept%20Brand%20Trust%20in%202020.pdf\">59%</a> of consumers think that companies need to follow up on their statements on diversity with concrete action, or they risk being seen as exploitative and opportunist.

Potential customers will simply jump to a competing site if yours is slow to load.</p> \n<p>But if you learn what metrics to hit and start to improve your pages, Google will reward you with better rankings — and you'll create a more enjoyable experience for potential customers.</p> \n<p>To do so, you need to understand the metrics that make up the Core Web Vitals:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\">Largest Contentful Paint</a> (LCP) measures the loading performance of a page. It considers the amount of time it takes to load the largest piece of content (typically a video, image, or text block) from when a user requests the URL. Google recommends sites <strong>keep LCP under 2.5 seconds for 75% of their page loads</strong>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/fid/\">First Input Delay</a> (FID) measures the interactivity of a page. It's the time between an action (think, clicking a button or a link) to when a browser responds to that action. The FID measurement comes from whatever element is clicked first, turning the page from a static to interactive. Responsiveness is crucial to making a good first impression with visitors by showing your site is reliable and running smoothly. Google recommends sites <strong>keep FID under 100 milliseconds for 75% of page loads</strong>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/cls/\">Cumulative Layout Shift </a>(CLS) measures all of the layout shifts that occur across a page. It's scored from zero (no shifting) to a positive number (more shifting). Common causes of shifting are dropdown banner ads, buttons that appear, or images that cause a text block to move. These all contribute to a negative user experience, which is why it's important to reduce the shifts that happen across your site. Google recommends sites <strong>aim for a CLS score of 0.1 or less</strong>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cumulative-layout-shift.jpg?width=584&amp;name=cumulative-layout-shift.jpg\" alt=\"cumulative-layout-shift\" width=\"584\" style=\"width: 584px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://web.dev/defining-core-web-vitals-thresholds/\">Image source</a></p> \n<p>By analyzing millions of pages, Google found that <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html#f6\">users are 24% less likely to abandon loading pages</a> when a site meets the above requirements. If you're itching for more details, check out the research behind <a href=\"https://web.dev/defining-core-web-vitals-thresholds/\">Defining the Core Web Vitals metric thresholds</a>.</p> \n<h2>How to Improve Core Web Vitals</h2> \n<p>First thing’s first, you need baseline metrics for your site. Walk through these steps to learn your starting point:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Plug your URL into Google's <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\">PageSpeed Insights</a> tool.</li> \n <li>Click 'Analyze.'</li> \n <li>Check your performance. The labels “Poor,” “Needs improvement,” and “Good” are given to your URL on both mobile and desktop. Toggle between the two in the upper left-hand corner of the page.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Here's what it looks like when I ran an analysis on HubSpot.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/page-speed-insights-hubspot.jpg?width=534&amp;name=page-speed-insights-hubspot.jpg\" alt=\"page-speed-insights-hubspot\" width=\"534\" style=\"width: 534px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/page-speed-insights.jpg?width=502&amp;name=page-speed-insights.jpg\" alt=\"page-speed-insights\" width=\"502\" style=\"width: 502px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hubspot.com%2F&amp;tab=mobile\">Image source</a></span></p> \n<p>You can see the desktop version performs better than mobile, which is common. In a study of five million pages, Backlinko found that the <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/page-speed-stats#:~:text=The%20average%20Fully%20Loaded%20speed,mobile%20devices%20than%20on%20desktop.\">average web page takes 87.84% longer to load on mobile versus desktop</a>. A few major factors that affected speed: the type of CMS, CDNs and hosting, and page weight.</p> \n<p>If your URL doesn't have enough data for a specific Core Web Vitals metric, you won't see that metric appear on the report. Once your URL has enough data, your page status will reflect the metric that performs the worst.</p> \n<h2>Fixing Issues in Core Web Vitals</h2> \n<p>It will take work to improve the performance of your pages, but you can begin tackling issues with a step-by-step approach.</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Prioritize issues by label:</strong> Tackle everything labeled \"Poor\" first. Then, choose your work based on the large-scale issues that affect the highest number of URLs or the most important URLs. Next comes issues with the \"Needs Improvement\" label.</li> \n <li><strong>Make a list:</strong> Create a prioritized work list for the team that will be updating the site. Include these common page fixes for reference:</li> \n</ol> \n<ul> \n <li>Reduce page size to less than 500KB.</li> \n <li>Limit each page to 50 resources for optimum mobile performance.</li> \n <li>Consider optimizing your page for fast loading using <a href=\"https://amp.dev/about/how-amp-works\">AMP</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<strong>3. Share common fixes:</strong> Each Core Web Vitals metric has a dozen ways to improve the threshold. Below, I've outlined the basic reasons for a \"Poor\" status and how each can be fixed.\n<br> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Improving LCP</span> is affected by <a href=\"https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/#slow-servers\">slow server response times</a>, <a href=\"https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/#client-side-rendering\">client-side rendering</a>, <a href=\"https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/#render-blocking-resources\">render-blocking JavaScript and CSS</a>, and <a href=\"https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/#slow-resource-load-times\">slow resource load times</a>. You can aim to improve LCD by optimizing each of the following site elements:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/apply-instant-loading-with-prpl\">Apply instant loading with the PRPL pattern</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/\">Critical Rendering Path</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/fast#optimize-your-css\">CSS</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/fast#optimize-your-images\">Images</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/fast#optimize-web-fonts\">Web Fonts</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/fast#optimize-your-javascript\">JavaScript</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Improving FID</span> is all about measuring how fast your site responds to user actions. Here, you want to fix any bad first experiences people have on a page. To see how to improve your FID threshold and check how users interact with your site, you can run a performance audit with Chrome's <a href=\"https://web.dev/lighthouse-performance/#opportunities\" style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">Lighthouse</a> tool. You can also try the following tweaks to boost your score.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/third-party-summary/\">Reduce the impact of third-party code</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/bootup-time/\">Reduce JavaScript execution time</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/mainthread-work-breakdown/\">Minimize main thread work</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/resource-summary/\">Keep request counts low and transfer sizes small</a></li> \n</ul> Improving CLS and reducing unexpected shifts comes down to following a handful of best practices. Say goodbye to jumpy banners and those accidental ad clicks.\n<br> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Include size attributes or </strong><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/\"><strong>CSS aspect ratio boxes</strong></a><strong> for images and videos.</strong> These numbers tell the browser how much space to allocate for the page element while it's loading, which prevents shifts as elements become visible.</li> \n <li><strong>Don't add content above existing content.</strong> The only exception is if it's in response to a user action where a shift is expected.</li> \n <li><strong>Provide context for transitions.</strong> All animations and transitions within a layout need to have context and continuity if you're moving users from one part of the page to another.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you think a specific issue is fixed, you can check if your thresholds have improved on the Search Console Core Web Vitals report. Click \"Start Tracking\" to launch a 28-day <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520#validation\">validation session</a> that monitors your site for any signs of the issue. If it doesn't pop up during that time, consider it fixed.</p> \n<p>Like all ranking factors, the devil is in the details. If you're a developer or techie hungry for more information on optimizing the Core Web Vitals, take a look at Google's guides to <a href=\"https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/\">optimizing LCP</a>, <a href=\"https://web.dev/optimize-fid/\">FID</a>, or <a href=\"https://web.dev/optimize-cls/\">CSL</a>.</p> \n<h2>Timeline for Core Web Vitals Ranking</h2> \n<p>Core Web Vitals will be included in Google Search ranking beginning May 2021. They originally announced plans for the update in May 2020 but pushed off the release due to the global impact of COVID-19.</p> \n<p>And, as Dave Brong, CTO of <a href=\"https://www.webmechanix.com/\">WebMechanix</a>, points out, \"Core Web Vitals is the 'web 3.0' that our generation of SEO and web development experts are facing.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"By shifting focus away from flimsy server-level metrics and more to the user experience (UX), Google is paving the way for a better accessible web in the future.\"&nbsp;</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As you prepare your site for the Core Web Vitals, remember that these are just a part of Google's existing search signals.

Most of those skills have nothing to do with writing.</p> \n<p>Whether you've been a content marketer for years or you're looking to get hired for your first content marketing role, you're in luck. Here, let's explore the skills you'll need to hone to excel as a content marketer in 2021 and beyond.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=45dfadd0-e789-4e69-be07-522a87154e86&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Click here to sharpen your skills with the help of our content marketing  workbook.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/45dfadd0-e789-4e69-be07-522a87154e86.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Content Marketing Skills</span></h2> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">1. Copywriting</span></h3> \n<p>More likely than not, the vast majority of your role as a content marketer requires you to create content that converts leads and drives sales. To do this successfully, you need to be a good copywriter.</p> \n<p>However, it's important to note — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/copywriting-templates\">copywriting for marketing purposes</a> requires different skills than it might if you were writing for non-business purposes.</p> \n<p>For one, copywriting for a business requires a consistent commitment to writing in a brand's unique voice.</p> \n<p>This can get particularly difficult if you're a freelance content marketer who creates content for different businesses and industries. However, it's critical you develop the ability to write in different styles depending on the needs of a business.</p> \n<p>For a sales blog, for instance, you might need to write short, concise, straightforward sentences, since salespeople are often strapped for time and need answers immediately.</p> \n<p>Marketers, on the other hand, have a <em>bit</em>&nbsp;more time to appreciate writing for writing's sake, so you can take the time to use more creative, long-form sentences.</p> \n<p>Additionally, how you write a video script for an insurance company varies significantly from how you write social copy for an e-commerce business.</p> \n<p>Developing a brand voice — and knowing how to alter your writing style depending on business needs and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">audience persona</a> — is a critical skill in content marketing.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. Editing Skills</span></h3> \n<p>Along similar lines as copywriting, it's vital you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-editing-tips\">become a proficient editor</a> if you want to succeed as a content marketer.</p> \n<p>Good, clear writing can be powerful enough to persuade hesitant prospects to buy. And, on the flip side, messy, error-prone writing could cause new visitors and prospects to abandon your site entirely.</p> \n<p>In short, the ability to edit is the difference between mediocre writing and compelling, engaging, high-converting content.</p> \n<p>No pressure, right?</p> \n<p>Learning how to create content quickly is a critical skill of any content marketer, particularly if you're responsible for creating content across a variety of channels for your business. Editing, then, is a mandatory step for cleaning up that copy and making it sound as professional and polished as possible.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">3. SEO Skills</span></h3> \n<p>This skill was a tricky one for me to master, but it is vital for ensuring my content ranks online and reaches the right audience when they need it most.</p> \n<p>As a content marketer, your role isn't just to create high-quality content. It's also to create content that converts readers, listeners, or watchers into customers.</p> \n<p>And to do this, you need a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\">basic understanding of SEO</a>.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you're a content marketer who's in charge of your company's YouTube page, you'll want to know how to conduct keyword research to discern what people are looking for on YouTube, and then write compelling, SEO-optimized titles and video descriptions to attract viewers to those videos.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, as a blogger, you'll need to know how to create SEO-optimized content — including using appropriate alt-text in your images, using relevant keywords in your section titles, and thoughtfully incorporating keywords throughout your content (rather than keyword-stuffing).</p> \n<p>Ultimately, SEO ensures the content you work hard to create is served to the right audiences, at the right time. Without an SEO foundation, then, it will be difficult to succeed as a content marketer.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">4. A Talent for Interviewing</h3> \n<p>As a content marketer, you're often tasked with creating content around unfamiliar or complex topics.</p> \n<p>It can feel daunting to do the research necessary to create an informative, helpful piece of content on a topic for which you're a novice at best. This is where interviewing can help you level up as a content marketer.</p> \n<p>For instance, when I needed to write about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seos-are-upset-about-relnofollow-announcement\">Google's rel=nofollow announcement</a> last year, I knew I'd have a hard time determining why it mattered to our audience if I didn't speak to an SEO strategist. Which is why I interviewed my colleague, Victor Pan, to add expert advice and help my audience understand the topic on a deeper level.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">5. Time Management &amp; Organization Skills</span></h3> \n<p>One of the most important skills any content marketer can foster is the skill to stay organized even under tight deadlines.</p> \n<p>Being a content marketer means publishing content on a consistent, effective basis to ensure you're reaching and converting audiences into leads for your sales team every month. As such, being organized and adhering to a content calendar that aligns with your company's goals is a critical aspect of your role.</p> \n<p>Additionally, writing can get tiring, so time management is important for avoiding burnout. For instance, if you're required to write four blog posts per week, it will be helpful if you can block off time in your calendar for \"Writing Time\" during your peak productivity hours. Writing those four blog posts the night before the posts are due won't set you up for success as a content marketer.</p> \n<p>Consider using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-project-management-software\">project management software</a> to ensure your content remains organized even as your team scales.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">6. Data &amp; Analytics Skills</span></h3> \n<p>If you don't have the skills necessary to analyze how your content is performing, then it will be difficult — if not impossible — to iterate on your strategy over time and achieve new levels of growth.</p> \n<p>A content marketer's role includes the ability to analyze industry trends, keep up-to-date on your audience's preferences and behavior, and use all <em>that</em>&nbsp;information to make strategic decisions and expand your brand's reach.</p> \n<p>When I first started creating content for HubSpot's Blog, I was vehemently opposed to data. I enjoyed the creativity of content creation, and data felt like the exact opposite of all that.</p> \n<p>However, over time I realized it didn't matter how creative or unique my content was if no one read it.</p> \n<p>This is where data came into play. It helped me iterate on the types of content I was writing, choose new topics to tackle that I knew my audience liked best, and stay ahead of industry trends to ensure my content aligned with conversions happening with marketers across the globe.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, data is vital for ensuring you have a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\">strong, effective content strategy</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These are just a few skills you'll need to master as you level up as a content marketer. Ultimately, the ability to remain flexible and figure out the needs of your <em>own</em> company's unique goals is critical to succeeding as a content marketer for the long-haul.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p>
