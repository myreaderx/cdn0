Great if you also use Active Record with Ruby on Rails.</li>\n<li>Progress - <a href=\"https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD\">MBProgressHUD</a> - a nice easy was to drop in a progress dialog.</li>\n<li>Images - <a href=\"https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage\">SDWebImage</a> - a nice easy way to fetch (and cache) remote images.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>What are your best iOS libraries?
