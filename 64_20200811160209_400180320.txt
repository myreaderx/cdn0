Google famously entered the smartphone industry with the Pixel, its first, entirely &#8216;Made by Google&#8217; smartphone. The Pixel smartphone went onto redefine what a pure Android experience could look like, becoming the gold standard in the Android OS experience. James Tsai&#8217;s Google Pixel Smartwatch concept does the same for the Android Wear OS.</p><p>Embodying Google&#8217;s playful-serious aesthetic, the Pixel Smartwatch concept comes in a traditional round format, and in a variety of quirkily named colors. The Android Wear OS logo displays clearly on the always-on display of the watch, transforming into a colorful set of watch hands every time you look at it to read the time. The watch comes with Google&#8217;s top-notch voice AI, all of Google&#8217;s native apps, and a heart-rate monitor on the back, which ties in well with Google&#8217;s acquisition of Fitbit and their entire fitness-tech ecosystem. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this wearable concept were entirely waterproof too, just to fire shots at Apple!</p><p>Designer: <a\nhref=\"https://www.jamestsai.com/\" target=\"_blank\"

We need a gadget like Morphox which is a conceptual controller designed to adapt to a variety of gaming experiences while still being ergonomic.</p><p>While most tech is now becoming modular to adapt to our flexible lifestyle (or flexible game choices), gaming controllers are still pretty set in their mold. Morphox breaks this mold with a design that creatively incorporates feedback from existing controllers like the placement of the trigger button for better access which is a starting point. &#8220;This personal exploration project of mine where I have taken the idea of playing around with the controller of the future that lets you be more into the game hypothetically having an apt. compatible console system that these controllers work,&#8221; says Gohil.</p><p>The triggers are ergonomically placed to maximize the gaming experience. To reduce the strain on the index finger, the triggers were positioned to optimize middle and fourth finger functionality instead. However, the placement and the undefined clickable area of the square (menu) button makes me question how that click will play out. The improved positioning of the buttons on the joystick comes with a softer touch and accurate locomotive tracking feature. Morphox comes with modular parts and accessories that make it a multipurpose controller &#8211; you can turn it into a firing gun, a steering wheel, or even an &#8216;explorer&#8217; dashboard by extending it to become a smart bike handle. The possibilities are endless with this design and I hope to see controllers get more creative because it isn&#8217;t &#8216;fun and a game&#8217;, it is fun and games&#8217;!</p><p>Designer: Chinmay

addiction!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=272863","description":"<p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272879\"

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Let&#8217;s be honest, how many of us feel FOMO if we have to separate from our phones for even the smallest amount of time? Smartphone addiction has been a problem even before COVID ( Report show that 60% of U.S. college students consider themselves to have a cell phone addiction) &#8211; the quarantine, separation, and fear of the unknown has raised this addiction to a whole level! The solution to this? Practicing mindfulness. The Japanese have been practicing meditation and mindfulness through centuries, one of the prime examples of this is the minimalistic beauty of the zen garden. Designer Juwon Kim decided to merge tech and tradition, creating a design that aims to improve our lifestyle by helping us break free from our bad habits and to lead a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>Meet HYUU &#8211; a wireless smartphone charger elevated to help you break the obsessive need to keep checking on our phones while charging so we can return back to our mindless scrolling! Almost meditative in design, HYUU takes inspiration from the Japanese zen gardens. The gadget&#8217;s surface replicates the patterns we find in the sand with an incense-stick like indicator that attaches to its base. The process of placing your gadget on the charger means taking a break from constant exposure to content. This process of leaving your device to charge is also a way to get some quality me-time, so at the end of the day, you are not left wondering &#8211; where did the day just go?! Now, the initial moment of keeping our gadgets and walking away feels almost scary according to the designer &#8220;Because FOMO is an only human and universal emotion, it cannot be completely eliminated, but I tried to put the meaning of time, situation, and space that can be controlled. Therefore, what about providing time to look back on yourself without blaming yourself for feeling FOMO?&#8221; The simple indicator comes into play here &#8211; as your device charges, the led indicator on the incense stick also lowers, signaling an end to the relaxation time while keeping in check our compulsive need to continuously keep checking our phones. The charging level of the phone can now be known without actually looking at the screen &#8211; giving you quality, uninterrupted me time!</p><p>&#8220;Karesansui(かれさんすい), which is based on &#8216;discovering something out of nothing&#8217;, is a space where you can look at the garden and answer your own question.&#8221; says the designer. The same way, this wireless charger is a small yet definitive step to help you disconnect and focus on your self. Afterall as our favorite Grand Jedi Master Yoda puts it &#8216;In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.&#8217; Let&#8217;s come out of this quarantine with an improved understanding of ourselves!</p><p>Designer: Juwon Kim</p><p><img\nsrc=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/c23d65101640793.5f232c18c4b2b.gif\" alt=\"Incense light\"

want","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=272449","description":"<p><iframe\ntitle=\"Beluga tent 6-in-1 from Qaou\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beluga/beluga-tent-6-in-1-from-qaou/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p><p>Camping is all about location and weather, and those two factors can heavily influence how you camp. Sometimes it&#8217;s sunny out, sometimes it suddenly begins pouring. Your campsite could be grassy, muddy, gravel-filled, or even have a rivulet or stream flowing underneath. A myriad of factors determine your camping experience, and it only makes sense that your camping equipment/shelter adjusts itself based on those factors. Meet the Beluga tent, a shapeshifting, modular tent that can be laid out in not 2 or 3, but rather 6 different formats. You could use the Beluga (or parts of it) as a tent, a tent with an awning, a tarp, a roof-like shelter, a cocoon-hammock, or two separate open hammocks. Depending on the weather, the location, the number of people you&#8217;re camping with, and whether you&#8217;ve got a trailer/RV with you, the Beluga adjusts, modifies to give you the experience you need.</p><p>Designed to be portable, adjustable, and modular too, the Beluga easily transforms based on your needs. The tent accommodates two people, although its modular nature allows you to attach multiple tents to each other to create a large camping community. The tent comes with an inner enclosure, held in place using aluminum rods, and covered with an outer cover that helps properly shield you from elements like the rain or even the sun. To help extend the tent&#8217;s footprint, the Beluga even comes with an awning that attaches to the entrance, giving you a nice shaded &#8216;patio&#8217; of sorts right outside your tent. The magic, however, lies in the fact that all these components, the enclosure, clad, and awning, can be used in a variety of ways. The awning and outer clad easily double up as two individual hammocks when you want, or a hammock with its own cover when you&#8217;re looking for some shade. You could even set them up as a roofed shelter away from your tent, or even use them as awnings outside your RV or caravan. No matter your camping setup, the Beluga adjusts to give you just the shelter you need&#8230; and even if you&#8217;re faced with inclement weather, or a damp/muddy campsite, the tent itself comes with an elevated entrance, so water or mud never seeps into your enclosure.</p><p>The Beluga tent is named after the beluga, a large white whale found in parts of the Arctic, owing to the tent&#8217;s white color. Some would say it&#8217;s sort of impractical to have a tent that&#8217;s white in color because of all the mud, dirt, grass, etc., but the Beluga tent wears its color as a badge of honor because it comes made entirely from recycled plastic water bottles&#8230; and to prevent the use of environment-harming chemical dyes, the tent just opts to stay white instead. Each Beluga tent is made using an average of 125 plastic bottles, helping cut environmental waste, and the tent even comes with a 2-year warranty, with every part being serviceable/repairable to increase its product life. Designed to be waterproof, the tent does manage to repel dirt and mud with ease, and that all-white canopy actually helps keep the inside of the tent cooler during the day too. In fact, the aluminum poles used in the Beluga are created with a lower carbon footprint too, so your entire camping experience is great for you, as well as for mother nature!</p><p>Designer: Qaou Outdoor</p><p><a\nhref=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beluga/beluga-tent-6-in-1-from-qaou?ref=creator_nav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $234</strong></a> <del\ndatetime=\"2020-08-11T10:41:30+00:00\">$371</del> ($137 off).
