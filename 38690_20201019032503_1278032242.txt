It looks like a deep bruise but they want to make sure that&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p><strong>5:45pm ET:</strong> LeMahieu has right knee inflammation, the Yankees announced. X-rays came back negative. Hopefully he&#8217;ll be able to return to action following the off-day tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>5:06pm ET:</strong> DJ LeMahieu was removed from this afternoon&#8217;s game in the third inning with a possible injury. He walked off the field gingerly following the bottom of the second and was slow going down the dugout steps. LeMahieu fouled a pitch into his knee two days ago.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve honestly lost count of how many Yankees are on the injured list right now. I think it&#8217;s 13? At least 12, I know that much. Among those injured Yankees are three infielders (Miguel Andujar, Didi Gregorius, Troy Tulowitzki), and three outfielders (Aaron Hicks, Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton). Geez.</p>\n<p>LeMahieu had a single and a fly out earlier in the game, not to mention several fairly routine defensive plays, and he seemed to be moving okay until the end of the second inning. With a sizeable lead and an off-day tomorrow, hopefully this is just precautionary. Stay tuned for updates.</p>\n<p>Should LeMahieu miss time, the Yankees already have Thairo Estrada on the big league roster, and the <a href=\"http://riveraveblues.com/2019/04/yankees-sign-brad-miller-to-minor-league-contract-187672/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently signed Brad Miller</a> in Triple-A as an obvious call-up candidate. Hopefully it doesn&#8217;t come to that. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://riveraveblues.com/2019/04/dj-lemahieu-exits-sundays-game-with-possible-injury-188110/\">Update: DJ LeMahieu exits Sunday&#8217;s game with right knee inflammation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://riveraveblues.com\">River Avenue Blues</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 23:33:17 +0000","feedId":38690,"bgimg":"http://riveraveblues.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DJ-LeMahieu-min-2.png?x56050","linkMd5":"d42e71ca5d088a1c0867a608f2fc918a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"Mike","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://riveraveblues.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DJ-LeMahieu-min-2.png?x56050":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603077902409}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 11:25:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 11:25:02","feedId":38690,"fetchDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 03:25:02 +0000","fetchMs":92,"handleMs":28318,"totalMs":29149,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"6adc9ee180e15d93daf6364a5c318f90","hostName":"us-010*","requestId":"dd02b4d3d3c14d52a62321c5c9f4647f_38690","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:14:57","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 03:14:57","id":38690,"name":"River Avenue Blues","url":"http://riveraveblues.com/feed/","subscriber":83,"website":null,"icon":"http://riveraveblues.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"","weekly":null,"link":"http://riveraveblues.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603077873980,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":111,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":28318,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://riveraveblues.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DJ-LeMahieu-min-2.png?x56050","sourceStatusCode":521,"sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":38690,"totalSpendMs":164,"convertSpendMs":0,"createdTime":"2020-10-19 11:25:02","host":"europe-23*","referer":"http://riveraveblues.com/?p=188110","linkMd5ListStr":"d42e71ca5d088a1c0867a608f2fc918a,d42e71ca5d088a1c0867a608f2fc918a","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[521],"sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://riveraveblues.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DJ-LeMahieu-min-2.png?x56050","sourceStatusCode":404,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":38690,"totalSpendMs":364,"convertSpendMs":0,"createdTime":"2020-10-19 11:25:02","host":"us-017*","referer":"http://riveraveblues.com/?p=188110","linkMd5ListStr":"d42e71ca5d088a1c0867a608f2fc918a,d42e71ca5d088a1c0867a608f2fc918a","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[404],"sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"}],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://riveraveblues.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DJ-LeMahieu-min-2.png?x56050","sourceStatusCode":404,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"feedId":38690,"totalSpendMs":364,"convertSpendMs":0,"createdTime":"2020-10-19 11:25:02","host":"us-017*","referer":"http://riveraveblues.com/?p=188110","linkMd5ListStr":"d42e71ca5d088a1c0867a608f2fc918a,d42e71ca5d088a1c0867a608f2fc918a","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[404],"sourceSize":"0","destSize":"0"}],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
