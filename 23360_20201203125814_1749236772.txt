With <STRONG>Native Mode</STRONG>, Admins can confidently manage Yammer policy through Azure Active Directory and the Microsoft 365 Admin Center without entering Yammer to manage things like group membership, group privacy, or data classification. In Native Mode, Yammer enforces Microsoft 365 group creation policies and all communities are Microsoft 365 connected with all files stored in SharePoint, which means that any files uploaded into Yammer automatically adhere to existing policies and governance. For existing networks, previously uploaded files will be migrated to SharePoint through the Alignment Tool. Native Mode ensures a consistent user experience across all users and communities, and gives users access to modern experiences like Live Events, connected SharePoint Sites, and shared document libraries.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<H2>Get started with the new Yammer</H2>\n<P>We’ll be rolling out the new Yammer to a select number of private preview customers starting in December and expanding the preview beyond that in the coming months.
