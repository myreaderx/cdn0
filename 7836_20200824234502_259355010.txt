Loaiza is being held on a $200,000 bond and faces felony charges of possessing and transporting a controlled substance with intent to sell.</p>\n\n<p>According to the San Diego Sheriff’s Department, Loaiza was stopped by police for a minor traffic violation while driving a vehicle suspected of being involved in drug smuggling. The vehicle search exposed a secret compartment used to conceal contraband. Police obtained a search warrant to search Loaiza's home, where they discovered a substance believed to be cocaine worth an estimated value of $500,000.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/n98mj0ixd/cocaine.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department released an official statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>During surveillance related to that investigation, Loaiza was seen driving a vehicle believed to be involved in the smuggling of narcotics. Loaiza was contacted during a traffic stop for a minor traffic infraction after leaving home in the City of Imperial Beach. A search of the vehicle led to the discovery of a sophisticated aftermarket compartment used to conceal contraband.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/a5326aoap/baseball.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Based on evidence obtained during the traffic stop a search warrant was issued for the Imperial Beach home which had been leased by Loaiza in early February,' the release continued. 'The home was just steps away from an area preschool. The subsequent search of the home led to the discovery of 20 kilograms of suspected cocaine which had an estimated value of about $500,000.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Loaiza pitched in the major leagues from 1995 to 2008, reports the San Francisco Chronicle.&#160;He played for eight different teams and was a starter for the 2003 All-Star Game as a member of the Chicago White Sox. Loaiza played 14 MLB seasons with a career record of 126-114, notes The Washington Post. According to Baseball-Reference, Loaiza made more than $43.7 million over his career, reports the Daily Mail.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/cz67jsnwx/baseballfield.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Loaiza recently attended SoxFest, an event held in Chicago in which former White Sox players interact with fans and sign autographs, according to The Inquisitr.</p>\n\n<p>Loaiza’s agent, John Boggs, told the San Francisco Chronicle that he has not spoken with Loaiza recently and that he had no information about the arrest. He said Loaiza had called his office early last week, but Boggs was unavailable.</p>\n\n<p>‘‘I am shocked and saddened by the news and had no indication he would ever be in this type of situation,’’ Boggs reportedly said in a text message to the newspaper. ‘‘I do not know how he would get himself involved in this, so it is difficult to even comment on it.’’</p>\n\n<p>It is not the first time Loaiza has dealt with law enforcement. He was arrested in 2006 while playing for the Oakland Athletics after he was caught speeding and failed a sobriety test.</p>\n\n<p>It is unknown whether Loaiza has hired a lawyer to take his case because Loaiza could not be reached for comments. Packages of white powder are&#160;being tested, but are believed to be cocaine, according to San&#160;Diego Sheriff's Lt. Jason&#160;Vickery. Loaiza’s charges are said to add up to at least 15 years in prison. Loaiza faces his court date on Wednesday.</p>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/gui3qSEwVWo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"

reports The News &#38; Observer.</p>\n\n<p>He was charged with one count each of felony child abuse inflicting serious bodily injury and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious bodily injury, Fox 8 reports.</p>\n\n<p>Yet on Feb. 10, those turned into murder charges after the child passed away.</p>\n\n<p>Two days before, deputies and emergency responders rushed to save the infant's life after receiving calls he was unresponsive.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Baby.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The child was transported to Randolph Hospital before being taken to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Brenner Children's Hospital.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, Kirkpatrick -- who is not biologically related to the infant -- was arrested and charged.</p>\n\n<p>Kirkpatrick is now in jail with no bond.</p>\n\n<p>It's not the first time a North Carolina resident has captured national attention for child abuse.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Paddle.jpg/800px-Paddle.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>WAVY recently reported that public school teachers and principals in two North Carolina districts are legally allowed to hit their students as long as they have&#160;parental permission.</p>\n\n<p>Graham and Robeson County public schools continue to beat misbehaving students, reportedly hitting 75 kids last school year.</p>\n\n<p>\"We've got more than 90 studies that show that there are negative effects [from the use of corporal punishment],\" Tom Vitaglione, with the group&#160;\"NC Child,\"&#160;said. \"There's no studies showing a positive effect.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"[The law is] about as close as you can come to sanctioning child abuse,\" Vitaglione added.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, groups like Vitaglione's have fought hard to ban such practices in various other North Carolina districts -- and achieved success.</p>\n\n<p>\"We've been working one-by-one with local school systems across the state,\" Vitaglione explained</p>\n\n<p>\"We feel it's really important to try to break this cycle, and we're happy that it's happened in 113 of the school districts,\" &#160;he added. \"We hope that the last two will come on board soon.\"</p>\n\n<p>The districts' punishments have since sparked controversy, producing a diverse range of responses.</p>\n\n<p>Asked to comment on the two districts, State Superintendent Mark Johnson&#160;echoed similar sentiments to Vitaglione's.</p>\n\n<p>\"While this is a local decision, we know that there are more effective and constructive ways of enhancing discipline and ensuring order than by using corporal punishment,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"I didn't even know that,\" parent Ken Harris said while picking up his first-grade daughter from a school in one of the districts. \"It seems like they might need a little reform there.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, some support the districts' use of corporal punishment.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't think there's anything wrong with it,\" one man said while he waited to pick up his fourth-grade grandchild. \"When I came up as a young boy, we were punished when we did wrong.\"</p>\n\n  <img

White House. Authorities in hazmat suits entered the building soon after to investigate the substance, before ultimately learning that it was baby powder.</p>\n\n<p>D.C.

An envelope with white powder in it was addressed to Donald Trump, Jr. and caused his wife, Vanessa, to be taken to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>\"You are an awful, awful person.

Thought it was Awesome that the Image showed up on the Flag for Memorial Day Weekend. I took pictures from the same place 5 minutes later and the Image is gone. What do you see on the Flag?

Stephen Paddock, 64, killed&#160;about 58 people and severely injured more than 850 by firing at concert goers at a music festival.</p>\n\n<p>After the massacre had&#160;taken place, Donald Trump also questioned the shooter’s mental capacity and whether or not he was a stable human being by saying that he was a \"sick, demented man\"&#160;whose \"wires are screwed up.\"</p>\n\n<p>The president completed his message&#160;telling the reporters repeatedly that it was not the right time to talk about gun control.</p>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/72U7jKsmVwU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:29:16 +0000","feedId":7836,"bgimg":"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/856672727530f4dfa577o-1518770267.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg","linkMd5":"52529a321e7f9603d98822629c3570d1","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"\n    Rashi Verma\n  ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/856672727530f4dfa577o-1518770267.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg":null,"https://s10.postimg.org/ybvyr6ujd/pexels-photo-864987.jpg":null,"https://s10.postimg.org/4wqai7d55/5440004897_59659815f4_o.jpg":null,"https://s10.postimg.org/lx96qxnmh/gun-shoot-cartridge-war-51117.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/72U7jKsmVwU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-42-57-429_ad11346f2cb0e1f1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312570066},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","title":"\n    Hero Grandmother Stops Attack On Police Officer (Video)  ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~3/FfUfm1yOC2U/hero-grandmother-stops-attack-police-officer","description":"\n    <img data-asset_id=\"55162\" class=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/000000000-1519147276.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Pulled over\" title=\"Pulled over\" /><p>A Louisiana grandmother may&#160;very well have saved a police officer's life after she jumped on a suspect while he reached for the officer's gun (video below).</p>\n\n<p>Vickie Williams-Tillman, 56, was on her way to the store to buy essentials for a Sunday meal when she noticed an officer and a suspect arguing with each other on the sidewalk, People reported.</p>\n\n<p>Williams-Tillman stopped her vehicle and saw the suspect attack the officer.</p>\n\n<p>\"They began tussling on the other side of the car,\" Williams-Tillman told People. \"It didn’t look good.\"</p>\n\n<p>Williams-Tillman, who is a mother-of-three and grandmother-of-four, called 911.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeopledotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F02%2Fhero-grandma.jpg%3Fw%3D2000&#38;w=1600&#38;q=70\" /></p>\n\n<p>\"But that wasn’t enough,\" she said. \"I thought, 'They’re not going to make it in time.'

McDonald's has made a number of changes to their menu over the years to combat the issue, such as cutting down the size of its french fries portions and adding fruit to the menu. Recently, the company changed its apple juice to one with less sugar.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5138/5583693961_1cd693794d_b.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>According to CNN, the company has been experimenting with new Happy Meal items around the world.</p>\n\n<p>In Italy, the company recently released a grilled chicken sandwich, while locations in both France and Australia began exploring other vegetable and protein options.</p>\n\n<p>Ernest Baskin, a professor of food marketing at Saint Joseph's University, said that the company is likely making the changes in order to both improve its image among parents and to reduce food costs.</p>\n\n<p>\"Kids do crave McDonald's, but parents might not always feel good about bringing them there,\" Baskin said. \"By positioning their meals as healthier, McDonald's is likely attempting to make the decision easier for the parents.\"</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5573/14663953996_de5c42a8e7_b.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>McDonald's said that it is aiming for all of the Happy Meal options to have 600 or fewer calories and less than 650 milligrams of sodium. The company is also aiming to have less than 10 percent of each meal's calories come from saturated fat and added sugar.</p>\n\n<p>The cheeseburger and chocolate milk on the Happy Meal menu did not meet those standards. The company reportedly hopes to have the chocolate milk back on the menu in the future, however, if it is able to cut sugar from the recipe. It is not clear when that will be.</p>\n\n<p>In 2010, Michelle Obama launched the White House initiative \"Let's Move!\" in an effort to solve childhood obesity. The former first lady's program got kids more focused on physical exercise and promoted healthy eating in schools. The program sparked a nationwide conversation about what's healthy for kids, and some say that the recent move by McDonald's is a direct result of Michelle Obama's efforts.</p>\n\n<p>McDonald's will reportedly be making other changes to the Happy Meal menu, as well. The six-piece chicken nugget Happy Meal will now come with a kids-sized fries instead of a small. Bottled water will also be added as an option on the menu, though it will cost extra.</p>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/GzDfWJY285A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:17:38 +0000","feedId":7836,"bgimg":"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/mcdonalds-1518719992.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg","linkMd5":"5707a24302986335f81bec6f8c457bfa","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"\n    Brendan Kelly\n  ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/mcdonalds-1518719992.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg":null,"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5138/5583693961_1cd693794d_b.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5573/14663953996_de5c42a8e7_b.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn57@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-43-00-902_e3c67c34168b211a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/GzDfWJY285A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-43-01-491_d4dd7cf23fcc7401.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312570066},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","title":"\n    Child Abused By Parents Looked Like 'Holocaust Victim'  ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~3/UkqsTK6NovU/toddler-beaten-tortured-and-starved-death-parents-looked-holocaust-victim","description":"\n    <img data-asset_id=\"55098\" class=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/childabuse-1518629498.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"300\" alt=\"child abuse\" title=\"child abuse\" /><p>Months after being arrested in connection with the death of their 3-year-old daughter, a Utah couple appeared in court while prosecutors reviewed evidence regarding their case.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Inquisitr, police were called to the home of Brenda Emile and Miller Costello in July 2017.

Other photos shown by Belenky demonstrated the child's hygiene, which he called \"deplorable.\"</p>\n\n<p>The forensic pathologist also testified that injuries the child sustained on her back were consistent with healing burns from cigarettes.

She found the content of the homework offensive.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05190915/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-7.08.03-PM.png\" style=\"height:715px; width:530px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Trameka Brown-Berry, from Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, is the mother of fourth-grader Jerome, a student at Our Redeemer Lutheran Church and School.</p>\n\n<p>One day, Jerome returned from school with an unusual assignment that his teacher had given him to complete. When Jerome shared this assignment with his mother, she was shocked to see what the school might be trying to teach her child.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05191021/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-7.09.37-PM.png\" style=\"height:579px; width:434px\" /></p>\n\n<p>The question clearly asked the students to come up with any three bad reasons for slavery, and also three \"good\" ones. Trameka, after having glanced at the assignment, was outraged at the audacity of the teacher to have asked such a question.</p>\n\n<p>Soon after, she posted a picture of the assignment, along with a short message, asking people if they were as outraged. “Does anyone else find my fourth-grader’s homework offensive?”</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/5s3w7yfc9/startup-photos.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Plenty of people responded shortly after Trameka posted.</p>\n\n<p>“Not only was this assignment offensive, it also minimizes the impact that slavery has had on Black people today. The faculty doesn’t just need culture training, they need an entire education,” commented one Facebook user.</p>\n\n<p>Another added to this by saying that, “What was good about slavery? I think this assignment was badly worded by the teacher.”</p>\n\n<p>While most of the commenters were horrified by the question in the homework, one of the comments tried to come up with a different angle.</p>\n\n<p>One Twitter user explained that \"good\" is in quotations and \"It's possible the question is asking kids to think critically about why a culture would have slavery and how it would be defended by those who did it. If appropriate class discussion accompanies it, it could be a good assignment.”</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people had their own opinions on a critical issue as this, but the most surprising and beautiful reason came from the fourth-grader himself. Jerome, may be a young boy but he is already a kind, confident and outspoken.</p>\n\n<p>Jerome wrote, “I feel there is no good reason for slavery.” For this, his mother was extremely proud of him.</p>\n\n<p>Trameka, along with a group of supporters, contacted the school board to get the issue sorted out. A statement was released by the principal of the school, Principal Jim Van Dellen, who was apologetic that the assignment was so inappropriate.</p>\n\n<p>“We understand that, as presented, the words used showed a lack of sensitivity and were offensive,” he explained to The Associated Press. “The purpose of this assignment was not, in any way, to have students argue that ANY slavery is acceptable -- a concept that goes against our core values and beliefs about the equality and worth of people of all races.”</p>\n\n<p>“Out of a very negative situation we were able to come together as a community and stand united in support. That is so beautiful, thank you,” Trameka wrote after seeing the response.</p>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/TfbHKFciU1A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Feb 2018 12:47:43 +0000","feedId":7836,"bgimg":"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/pexels-photo-207756-1518117260.jpeg/rndr_670x300.jpg","linkMd5":"a937f1e3be8caae1ae8a4d73c0a80147","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"\n    Rashi Verma\n  ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/pexels-photo-207756-1518117260.jpeg/rndr_670x300.jpg":null,"https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05190915/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-7.08.03-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn25@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-43-03-037_17042ca92560153f.webp","https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05191021/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-7.09.37-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn86@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-42-56-227_53244f275ac27537.webp","https://s10.postimg.org/5s3w7yfc9/startup-photos.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/TfbHKFciU1A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn66@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-43-02-377_494d7c2d38e4a04d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312570068},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","title":"\n    Teacher's Viral Message To Students Sparks Controversy (Photos)  ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~3/I3O--vKPgfU/teachers-message-students-sparks-controversy","description":"\n    <img data-asset_id=\"55101\" class=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/classroom-1518631891.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"300\" alt=\"classroom\" title=\"classroom\" /><p>An inspiring message to students went viral after teachers around the country began posting it in their classrooms.</p>\n\n<p>According to HuffPost, a California teacher's message to students went viral after one student shared a photo on her Twitter page.</p>\n\n<p>English teacher Senora Tarman put the note up on her classroom door to ensure students who felt afraid after Donald Trump became president of the U.S. that they still belong in the country.</p>\n\n<p>The note read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Dear undocumented students, </em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cw7bE7rUUAA8arW.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>In this classroom, there are no walls.

According to Babble, one teacher in New Jersey shared the inspirational message alongside a quote from South African anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu, which reads, \"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\"</p>\n\n<p>The high school teacher, Nagla Bedir, who teaches in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, said students responded positively to the message and began sharing photos on their social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-mia3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27750383_10208906557699561_3248336623527691082_n.jpg?oh=1788bb8433afcf036f0b08cd6259df79&#38;oe=5B19F48D\" /></p>\n\n<p>Other faculty members also loved the message and began sharing similar messages in their classrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Bedir herself is a Muslim woman who wears a hijab.

They received a tip informing them that the mom was looking for them in a garden. They reunited the babies with their mom one by one.</p>\n\n<p>The organization wrote a summary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>By 6.54 the vixen was on a mission and one fox cub now remained and by 7.01 pm, Paul text me a photo of the empty box. All through this, I was letting Beccie and Craig know and everyone was so pleased that the cubs were back where they belonged ... with mum!</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to Beccie whose quick thinking and help made this heartwarming story possible, to Craig and Karen for their invaluable help and the Animal Sanctuary for agreeing to pass the cubs on. To Paul and his team (The Fox Man at Freshfields) for collecting the cubs and sitting patiently with hearts in mouths waiting for the vixen to return.</p>\n\n<p>This story was only possible because of each and every person mentioned above and it really is heartwarming to know that this combined teamwork reunited five fox cubs, that were only days old, with their vixen mother. Well done everyone and thank you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/CXSsWQtARsQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 03:15:35 +0000","feedId":7836,"bgimg":"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/foxcub-1518442149.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg","linkMd5":"4ba3cfd001d7d5f387ac27a669a3e194","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"\n    Jonathan Constante\n  ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/foxcub-1518442149.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg":null,"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17309119_1675469952747046_7522326867592180680_n.jpg?oh=bbd6c289576346889aaa916a50b6279d&oe=5AD842CF":null,"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17308960_1675469926080382_8925966931677395071_n.jpg?oh=8316c9caa2e3a3b83b5d997471736253&oe=5B147A79":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/CXSsWQtARsQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn61@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-42-53-062_0750026320911bca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312570068},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","title":"\n    Old White Man Helps Young Black Man  ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~3/j8hlP0iMEYM/young-black-mans-car-broke-down-elderly-white-man-does-unexpected","description":"\n    <img data-asset_id=\"49250\" class=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2017/10/00000000000flat-1507675514.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Flat tire\" title=\"Flat tire\" /><p>It was summer 2015 and the nation was reeling after a video of a Pennsylvania police officer beating a black man had just gone viral on the internet.</p>\n\n<p>Racial tensions were undeniably high and media reports constantly reflected that at the time, reports Newsweek.

After returning home, the family noticed a red smear on the side of one of the cups and they described a strong smell coming out of the drink as \"metallic', according to the 19-page-long lawsuit.

Because of this, Amanda Vice suggested that, at first she was unable to see anything on one of the cups.</p>\n\n<p>She also added, \"Once we drank it, then we could see on the inside of the rim that there was blood.\" She also said her daughter was licking the lid from the cup, which had whipped cream on it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/k7c5w21u1/35455777401_4c60f389d4_o.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The family stated that none of its members were bleeding at the time, so they called Starbucks to ask if any employees had open wounds. They were told one employee at Starbucks had been bleeding but had been removed from the floor, the lawsuit states.</p>\n\n<p>The father, Louis, added, “My wife and my baby just drank someone’s blood.

Addie’s dad, Abel Rodriguez, is a senior airman who has fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to&#160;WAOI. &#160;</p>\n\n<p>During a football game when all the girls’ fathers stepped out of the bleachers to lift their daughters onto their shoulders, Addie was left alone, reports&#160;KTLA.</p>\n\n<p>Her mom, Alexis Perry-Rodriguez, explained, “It was really heartbreaking to see your daughter standing out there being the only one without their father, knowing why he’s away. It’s not just an absentee parent. He’s serving our country.”</p>\n\n<p>It was a stark reminder that her dad couldn’t be there for her. Her eyes welled up with tears as she watched the other cheerleaders with their fathers.</p>\n\n<p>“I just felt like really sad because I missed him a lot,” says Addie.</p>\n\n<p>But Matthew Garcia, a high school senior, saw that Addie was still on the ground and visibly distraught. So he jumped over the fence to ask her if she was OK.</p>\n\n<p>Garcia told WOAI, “I ran down from the bleachers right here. I just hopped the fence, and I went over, and I kneeled down, I talked to her and I said, ‘Are you OK?’”</p>\n\n<p>He immediately realized what was wrong and lifted her up onto his shoulders so she wouldn’t feel left out.</p>\n\n<p>“I realized what he [Garcia] was doing, and my heart just melted,” says Alexis. “It was just the most beautiful thing.”</p>\n\n<p>The high school senior is just glad he could help make Addie’s day.

Real laws that do everything possible to keep assault rifles out of the hands of people who are going to shoot our kids,\" Kimmel says.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Official_Portrait_of_President_Donald_Trump.jpg/473px-Official_Portrait_of_President_Donald_Trump.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>\"Tell these Congressmen and lobbyists, who infest that swamp you said you were going to drain, force these allegedly Christian men and women who stuff their pockets with money from the NRA year after year after year to do something.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kimmel then pleads with Trump to do something, slamming him for having \"done nothing\" to influence change in gun laws and restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>Many viewers agreed with Kimmel's stance on the issue, and criticized Trump for his lack of action.</p>\n\n<p>\"They dont want to talk about it now, its too early for the victims and their families, it was not too early when that muslim immigrant ploughed through streets with a car to talk about immigration bans though,\" one viewer commented on CNN's Facebook page.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Donald_Trump_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/495px-Donald_Trump_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>\"When your elected officials are getting 'contributions'&#160;in the millions democrat and republicans ... what do you think is going to happen the same thing that happened after the last mass shooting and the next one that's coming on the horizon ... Nothing,\" another added.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, several survivors of the shooting have begun to speak out -- including David Hogg, whose sister lost friends in the massacre.</p>\n\n<p>\"Sadly, my sister, she’s a freshman and she had two of her best friends die. And that’s not acceptable. That is something we should not let happen in this country, especially when we’re going to school. It’s something we really need to take a look at. The fact that this is the 18th school shooting, and this is only February, it’s a testament to where this country has come, and how far,\" Hogg told CNN's Alisyn Camerota, Uproxx reported.</p>\n\n<p>\"We need to dig out of this hole. We need to step out of it and take a look back and realize, there is something seriously wrong here. And some of our policy makers, and some people need to look in the mirror and take some action. Because ideas are great, but ideas stay ideas and children die.\"</p>\n\n<p><iframe height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0vLiQLpsc8\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/bbv43EIxYT4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 12:28:35 +0000","feedId":7836,"bgimg":"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/kimmeltrump-1518788595.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg","linkMd5":"2f0814852e8e3a4fd09cbdd7d74f25a4","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"\n    Sean Kelly\n  ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/kimmeltrump-1518788595.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg":null,"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Official_Portrait_of_President_Donald_Trump.jpg/473px-Official_Portrait_of_President_Donald_Trump.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Donald_Trump_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/495px-Donald_Trump_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-43-01-692_a16557dcb40a15c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/bbv43EIxYT4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn82@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-42-54-740_7967f070fb943963.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312570065},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","title":"\n    Woman Arrested After Allowing Boyfriend To Abuse Baby  ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~3/fYId8cJ0muo/after-boyfriend-murders-her-21-month-old-son-mom-gets-charged-1-sick-thing-she-did","description":"\n    <img data-asset_id=\"54955\" class=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/utpo-1518183437.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Cop car\" title=\"Cop car\" /><p>A Utah mother has been charged with child abuse after allowing her boyfriend to abuse her child and ultimately cause the baby's death.</p>\n\n<p>Gena Nicole Sanchez, 22, has been charged with two counts of second-degree felony child abuse a week after her boyfriend, 17-year-old Isaiah Weaver, was charged with causing the death of her 21-month-old baby, Jaycieion Sanchez, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.</p>\n\n<p>Weaver reportedly beat the baby boy with a heated clothes hanger.

She was very clear about the fact that getting into that hot tub was something that she did consensually and that in hindsight it was also something that she regretted having done.\"</p>\n\n<p>Several lawyers from Addis-Wechsler &#38; Associates said that&#160;settlement talks were headed by Messick, but the family says that is completely untrue.</p>\n\n<p>Messick's&#160;family released a statement regarding the issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In January 1997, Jill was an entry-level manager at Addis Wechsler. One of her first clients was Rose McGowan, and one of Jill’s first duties was to set up a breakfast meeting with Harvey Weinstein during the Sundance Film Festival. Following the meeting, Rose told Jill what had happened --&#160;that she made the decision to remove her clothes and get in the hot tub with him --&#160;a mistake which Rose immediately regretted. Rose never once used the word rape in that conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this, Jill recognized that Harvey had done something untoward to Rose, if not illegal. She immediately went to her bosses, the partners of Addis Wechsler, to recount Rose’s story and to insist that they immediately address the situation. They told Jill that they would handle the situation.</p>\n\n<p>The ensuing arrangements between Rose and Harvey were then negotiated, completely without Jill’s knowledge. At that time, all Jill knew was that the matter was settled and that Rose continued making films with the Weinsteins. She never knew any details until recently, when Rose elected to make them public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>McGowan and&#160;Weinstein have not yet commented on Messick’s suicide.</p>\n\n<p>Messick also leaves behind&#160;her two children, Jackson and Ava.</p>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/Ucu_Q7F6D3w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Feb 2018 02:05:54 +0000","feedId":7836,"bgimg":"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/7897401224c5723d61eao-1518196522.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg","linkMd5":"ecbb84b2be8594733d62c89d850cb0ae","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"\n    Rashi Verma\n  ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/7897401224c5723d61eao-1518196522.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg":null,"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2608/4068696971_9f216d4a5a_b.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn41@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-42-53-147_ab613a0fd8d11eeb.webp","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Harvey_Weinstein_2010_Time_100_Shankbone.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-42-58-531_82b75964a6705fbe.webp","https://s17.postimg.org/bpak73gnz/pexels-photo-103127.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/Ucu_Q7F6D3w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-43-01-071_6efd9f55f94821b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312570068},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","title":"\n    Traffic Stop Saves Child's Life  ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~3/S4B-r4H33lM/cop-pulls-speeding-mom-over-notices-something-strange-about-her-boy","description":"\n    <img data-asset_id=\"54274\" class=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/01/car-1516647726.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Police Car\" title=\"Police Car\" /><p>Most of us don't like being pulled over by a cop, but for one woman, it was a blessing in disguise;&#160;thanks to a traffic stop, her child is alive today.</p>\n\n<p>Officer Nick Mitchell initially pulled Michigan mother Rhonda McArthur over because she was speeding, reports WXYZ.</p>\n\n<p>Yet after approaching her car, the officer was distracted; he noticed there was something off about her 10-year-old son, Nickolas.</p>\n\n<p>\"He didn't ask for my driver's license and registration,\" recalls the mother. \"He looked at him and asked, 'Is he okay?'\"</p>\n\n<p>McArthur explained the boy was experiencing a life-threatening asthma attack.

Beth Bornstein Dunnington took to Facebook to write about a heartwarming moment she said she won't soon forget, Sunny Skyz reported.</p>\n\n<p>Dunnington said she was waiting to board her plane when she saw a young pregnant woman attempting to calm down her child, who appeared to be having a \"meltdown.\" The child was reportedly running around, kicking and screaming and lying on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>At one point, the child is said to have become&#160;so out of control that the mother buried her head into her hands and appeared to give up. That's when a group of total strangers -- all women -- intervened and lent&#160;a helping hand to the mother.</p>\n\n<p>In a lengthy post, Dunnington wrote about the experience, and part of that post is below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Lax_airport_sign.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then, this gorgeous thing (I'm crying just writing this)... the women in the terminal, there must have been six or seven of us, not women who knew each other, approached and surrounded her and the little boy and we knelt down and formed a circle around them. I sang 'The Itsy Bitsy Spider' to the little boy... one woman had an orange that she peeled, one woman had a little toy in her bag that she let the toddler play with, another woman gave the mom a bottle of water. Someone else helped the mom get the kid's sippy cup out of her bag and give it to him. It was so gorgeous, there was no discussion and no one knew anyone else, but we were able to calm them both down, and she got her child on the plane. Only women approached. After they went through the door we all went back to our separate seats and didn't talk about it... we were strangers, gathering to solve something. It occurred to me that a circle of women, with a mission, can save the world. I will never forget that moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dunnington's post quickly went viral, garnering more than 51,000 likes in just two weeks. The post was also shared more than 15,000 times.</p>\n\n<p>Several social media users commented on the photo.</p>\n\n<p>\"I am brought to tears! I invision a world ...

She said that the 75-item order was for the Christ Fellowship at the Outback Steakhouse where she was employed&#160;in Palm Beach Gardens,&#160;Florida.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/6nfr38l1l/pexels-photo-259165.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>\"We take the order over the phone, we put the order together, take payment and then take order to the car,\"Yoder said while speaking&#160;to The Palm Beach Post. \"It's a lot of work just as much as serving.\"</p>\n\n<p>Yoder went on to say that she only managed to make $18 from&#160;tips on Wednesday since she devoted most of her shift to&#160;putting up the church’s order of about 25 steaks, 25 chickens and 25 potatoes.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/fv7zjwpix/13177591514_403f54a29a_o.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Yoder then took to Facebook to complain that the Christ Fellowship had gone miser while giving her a tip. Although, she did not confess as to where she worked in that post.</p>\n\n<p>Later, when a friend of hers saw what she had written, he urged her to take the&#160;post down and further said that he would contact the Christ Fellowship directly to see whether they were in a position to offer some remedy to the dispute.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s10.postimg.org/v3xwxoymx/pexels-photo-106343.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Only the next day, when Yoder came in to work, she was told that Christ Fellowship had been refunded their whole order amount of $735 and that the company would be letting her go.</p>\n\n<p>As told by an Outback spokeswoman, Yoder had gone against&#160;the company’s policy, which prohibited any&#160;employee of the franchise to talk about their customers online.</p>\n\n<p>Christ Fellowship said that they had reported back to the restaurant after hearing the complaint from Yoder’s friend and confessed that they had never intended for her to get fired over the topic of a tip.</p>\n\n<p>The minimum wage for employees that have the advantage of getting tips&#160;is $5.23 per hour. Opinions vary from person to person with regard to the norms of giving tips to carry-out orders, but according to&#160;Yoder, it is a must.</p>\n\n<p>\"Coming in to eat or takeout, you should automatically be wanting to tip 15 per cent,\"&#160;she told WFLX, according to the Daily Mail. \"From there you either go up or you go down, based on service.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Thank you all very much for expressing your concerns,\"&#160;the church said in a statement on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are sorry to hear about this situation and our leaders have been notified about it.

She was forced to have her leg amputated, but decided to complete the Walk of Britain before undergoing the life-changing procedure.</p>\n\n<p>Ennis took the 1000-mile trek across Great Britain alongside several other veterans from around the world. Prince Harry also appeared at the event and met Ennis.</p>\n\n<p>Ennis gave Prince Harry dog tags that belonged to a friend she had lost. She took to Instagram to reflect on the event:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This was a hard one. There are people in your recovery who turn into your rock, and they never even truly realize it. Since my injury, I have met some of the most remarkable, and inspiring people. Chris Van Etten and Colleen Baune became pillars of strength for me even through the new challenges they faced after TJs passing. We may not be terribly close as we were in the beginning of my recovery, but I'll always feel indebted to you. I truly don't feel like I would be as far as I am now without you being there in the start. Thank you. I did this for you to honor TJ. All my love, and best wishes.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpeoplev6.alley.ws%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fkirstie-ennis-2-800.jpg&#38;w=2400&#38;q=70\" /></p>\n\n<p>As we finished at Buckingham Palace today, TJs dog tag was left with Prince Harry to be honored and remembered. Prince Harry has become a dear friend to us and genuine advocate for our militaries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since having her leg amputated, Ennis says she has worked hard to stay active and inspire others. She has posted several pictures, including one photo project called \"body image project,\" where she shows the results of her procedure.</p>\n\n<p>\"I wanted to show the scars initially, anywhere on my body, even the disfiguring scar on my face,\" Ennis told People. \"I wanted to portray the scars but I also I wanted to show the evolution of what I have been through.</p>\n\n<p>\"At the end of the day, the struggle of what you go through -- whether it be traumatic or if you have a bad day in everyday life -- the struggle is what makes you stronger.\"</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpeoplev6.alley.ws%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fkirstie-ennis-1-800-1.jpg&#38;w=2400&#38;q=70\" /></p>\n\n<p>Ennis is currently the director of Wounded Warrior Outdoors. She plans on climbing the Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, a climb which has never been attempted by a woman with the injuries she has.</p>\n\n<p>\"I’m trying to move forward without being a sitting duck with my leg,\" Ennis said. \"I can do whatever I want to do --&#160;it might just take a little longer and I have to find the means to do it.

Cross told the station that the discord started over four years ago when she moved to Fort Lauderdale. She says Robert and his family have been harassing her about parking in front of their house and blocking their driveway.</p>\n\n<p>However, things erupted on Tuesday when Cross and Robert confronted each other about her car blocking the driveway, Heavy reports.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/xadgsalpt/car.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>“These f**king people think they’re going to f**king park here and play their f**king games, f**k them,” Cross is heard muttering as she steps out of her car. “You don’t f**king own the road,” Cross is heard telling Robert as she walks over to him. He tells her that she is blocking his driveway and she continues her tirade, telling him he blocks the way of every car that passes down the road when he parks on the street himself.</p>\n\n<p>After a few more heated words are exchanged, Cross says, “Yes, I used the word f**king, if you haven’t heard it before. Except for your f**king son who dates a f**king n****r. ... Finally, I said it out loud,” Cross says as she walks away.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/tqrj2kbb5/image.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Herald reports that Avery Fenton, Robert's son and a local attorney, wrote a letter to the WSVN news station illustrating the incident which occurred on Feb.&#160;7.</p>\n\n<p>“Your employee reduced my girlfriend to nothing other than a slur based off of the color of her skin last night,” Avery&#160;wrote.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Avery states that his father was met with a barrage of verbal attacks. “The video ends with her using extremely foul language, and then a personal attack on me as my father’s son, for dating my girlfriend who is African American.

Contractions coming every 3 minutes, mildly intensifying and becoming closer together. Went from almost 3 cm dilated to a 4 in the first hour of arrival, and we thought we were in the early stages of welcoming our last baby into our family,\" Jesica wrote in a blog on Little Leapling Photography's website.</p>\n\n<p>She continued her rather amazing story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>After 4 hours of laboring in the tub, bouncing on the ball, and walking the halls, we decided we wanted to try to stick to our plan of an intervention free birth. So we chose to leave the hospital without any further progress and contractions that had begun to space out. We spent the following days gently encouraging the contractions, hoping to edge them on into labor. At home I was 5 cm dilated but would not move any further and contractions were uncomfortable, but never really gave me the feeling they would amount to anything more than a sleepless night.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/07/22/48F8F8B700000578-5364667-No_time_to_waste_Jesica_Hogan_based_in_Riley_Kansas_can_be_seen_-a-32_1518044357446.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We spent our days walking, going to the pool with our girls and completing small projects around the house. Every night brought timeable contractions that were not allowing me to sleep. I was losing faith in my ability to tell when I would actually be in labor, and losing faith that my body knew what it was doing.</p>\n\n<p>Sunday we spent nearly the whole day at our local pool and ended the evening with my mother in law and I painting our nails while we watched Game of Thrones with my husband. I put our 2 year old to bed, still contracting, and we snuggled for some time. Later, I vividly remember telling my husband, “I’m having contractions again, but I don’t think they’ll amount to anything”. I confided in him as we lay in bed that night that I was afraid I would either need to be induced, or that I wouldn’t know it was the real thing until it was too late and we were having a baby at home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The couple ultimately went to the hospital, and Jesica explained that she could \"feel the baby moving down quickly with each contraction.\" The mother knew that her son was on his way quicker than expected, and she even felt like the baby was ready to emerge as she attempted to get out of her car once she arrived at the ER. That feeling, she wrote, \"made it nearly impossible to move.\"</p>\n\n<p>Just as she was about to walk into the hospital, Jesica spotted Karin coming toward&#160;her. The two made their way into the hospital just as Jesica's husband, Travis, was coming back outside to get her after checking in and getting assistance.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/07/22/48F8FD9700000578-5364667-Intuition_Before_Max_s_birth_Jesica_had_become_worried_she_would-a-41_1518044357737.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>\"Tammy rushed through the doors ahead of us to alert the front desk&#160; that I was in fact having this baby right now and urged her to call for help,\" she wrote.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I made it just past the second set of automatic doors, into the next hall which luckily was not carpeted like the one we had just stepped out of. I know at this point I said something to the effect of, “oh god, he’s here”. I then started to take my pants off because I could feel my body pushing the baby’s head out. I reached down and could feel his head crowning with my hand. I looked at my husband and said, “Travis catch him!” Without any hesitation he did just that as I felt my body involuntarily pushing his head the rest of the way out. At that moment Tammy began snapping away! Then the nurses came rushing down the hall. It was a blur at this point, they reached us, helped me lay down just as my body began to push again.</p>\n\n<p>Travis said the ER nurse who reached us first quickly supported his head, he still had his hands on baby’s head too, as well as my back while they laid us down.

I was surprised when I found out that he voted in favor of stricter laws. This is a Republican state so you have to stick with your buddies otherwise it will hurt your career, but on the other hand, he is a john. It is hypocritical because he is supporting laws that make it stricter for other men who do what he does.”</p>\n\n<p>According to Taylor, he first approached her on March 7, 2017, writing, \"Looking at your website. Can you meet? Would need to be tonight. Only in town a little. Anytime. Can do in or out.

However, she had no clue that her decision that day would change her life for good.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Daily Mail, Parent decided to get a butterfly tattoo in order to give her younger sister more confidence in getting her own tattoo.</p>\n\n<p>\"The supermodels all had tattoos, they were super fashionable and I made a split-second decision that changed my life,\" Parent said of that day in July 1992. \"I remember noticing a guy before me had had a tattoo and the artist hadn't changed the needles. But I didn't think anything of it. We didn't in those days, I wasn't worried. In fact, I told my sister I would go first as I was the eldest. He changed the needle after he inked me.\"</p>\n\n<p>When Parent returned home, all seemed well with her new tattoo. But eight weeks later, she reportedly began developing flu-like symptoms.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/20/03/4964355600000578-5411061-image-a-78_1519095676156.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>\"I had a yellow face, I couldn't eat and I needed to sleep nearly all the time,\" she said. \"I knew I needed to go to the doctor, and when they told me my temperature was extremely high, I returned home where specialists ran lots of tests to see whether I had malaria.\"</p>\n\n<p>After ten days, doctors still did not have a prognosis for Parent.</p>\n\n<p>\"I was sleeping for 22 hours a day, so my mother said I had to go back to the hospital,\" she recalled. \"The specialist said that they had to test me for everything under the sun -- including HIV. She told me she'd be back with my results the next day.\"</p>\n\n<p>The next day, she received some shocking news. She was told that she only had six months to live.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/20/03/4964352600000578-5411061-Despite_everything_Lyn_pictured_has_lived_a_healthy_life_and_25_-a-3_1519097469955.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>\"I remember her body language and knowing it was going to be bad,\" Parent said. \"When she told me I had HIV and that I had six months to live, so I needed to get my bucket list out, I heard nothing except the fact that I had six months left.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I was in shock,\" she added. \"I had no idea why.\"</p>\n\n<p>Doctors worked to determine the source of Parent's HIV, testing three of her ex-boyfriends before eventually coming to the conclusion that the disease had come from her tattoo.</p>\n\n<p>\"I remember being shocked,\" she said. \"I had no idea that was possible.\"</p>\n\n<p>Parent told Stuff that she moved to New Zealand following her diagnosis, expecting to die there. Fortunately, she beat the odds and has now made it through 25 years with her condition.</p>\n\n<p>Parent, who has two children, now works to educate others about HIV and AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've started the fashion event StyleAid to raise money for women and children with HIV,\" she said. \"Anyone can get HIV and AIDS and it's important that precautions are taken. I think the testing should be compulsory, like smear tests.\"</p>\n\n<p>Despite the difficult journey, Parent remains positive about the direction her life has gone.</p>\n\n<p>\"I have no regrets, it is what it is,\" she said. \"Plus, I think about the good things. Had I not been diagnosed, I wouldn't have done all these things with my life. I share my story with schools and I have an opportunity to spread the word. Had this not all happened, my life probably wouldn't have gone this way. It's taught me to grab life as it comes and live in the now rather than ten years down the track. I don't have a fear of death like I used to. I've made peace with myself and I think it's made me even more positive as a person.

This gave him a taste of life in television and marked the start of a TV career that would continue for decades.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/9xt5ra2cx/pexels-photo-320442.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>His most talked-about role was in \"Flo,\" which was a spinoff of \"Alice\" and aired from 1980 to 1981 on CBS. Following that, he got a role in top shows of the time, including&#160; \"M*A*S*H\" and \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a recurring role as Pete Bilker. Other shows he was in include \"Baywatch,\" \"Entourage,\" \"It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" and \"Workaholics.\"</p>\n\n<p>Mickey Jones was a character actor who was typically cast as a rugged biker, a hippie or a blue collar worker. Jones’ most recent role was a 2015 recurring character as a pot dealer named Hot Rod Dunham on FX’s \"Justified.\"</p>\n\n<p>Jones’ movie appearances were limited to a few, but he made a mark in whatever role he bagged for himself, some of which include, \"Sling Blade,\" \"Tin Cup,\" \"Total Recall\" and \"The Last Best Sunday.\"</p>\n\n<p>In a 2009 Houston Chronicle Profile, Jones was sitting at the Bob’s Big Boy diner in Burbank, California, which said that he had frequented since 1960. He also went on to explain his acting approach as “I’m not a method actor.” He added, “When somebody says ‘action,’ I can turn it on, and when they ‘cut,’ I turn it back off.”</p>\n\n<p>Billy Bob Thornton, who was Jones’ friend and also a \"Sling Blade\" co-star, told the Houston Chronicle: “There’s no pretense to him and none in his acting, but he can do it all. He can do anything, from a kid’s enthusiasm to something real mean.”</p>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/-JWNzJVSntk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Feb 2018 12:48:16 +0000","feedId":7836,"bgimg":"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2017/10/movie-1507054340.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg","linkMd5":"5277254fc7a07e665aa1bb7bb36a30f6","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"\n    Rashi Verma\n  ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2017/10/movie-1507054340.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg":null,"https://s14.postimg.org/t2wf111ld/Mickey_Jones_By_Phil_Konstantin.jpg":null,"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a8/Vacation1983.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-43-00-052_3cafc84bef5ec67a.webp","https://s14.postimg.org/9xt5ra2cx/pexels-photo-320442.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/-JWNzJVSntk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn87@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-42-58-200_eb811984b4086c9b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312570068},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","title":"\n    Poll Shows Majority Support Impeachment If Trump's Indicted   ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~3/Zxp7igtO8JE/poll-shows-higher-change-and-support-impeachment-trump","description":"\n    <img data-asset_id=\"53921\" class=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/01/london1-1515772578.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Donald Trump on the campaign trail\" title=\"Donald Trump on the campaign trail\" /><p>A new poll reveals many Americans would urge Congress to pursue impeachment should Robert Mueller's investigation find President Donald Trump acted illegally.</p>\n\n<p>The results, which include&#160;internal polling data from the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner and was released by left-leaning group Stand Up America, found that 65 percent of the 1,001 registered voters surveyed would support Trump's impeachment, reports McClatchy.</p>\n\n<p>However, that's only the case if Trump was found to be personally involved in colluding with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Support for impeachment dropped to 58 percent if an associate of Trump's was found to have acted unlawfully.</p>\n\n<p>\"The survey suggests voters would also turn strongly against the President if the investigation produces evidence of illegal actions by Trump or his team, with little variability depending on the details of the crimes,\" the Stand Up America memo states.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Vladimir_Putin_and_Donald_Trump_at_the_2017_G-20_Hamburg_Summit_%284%29.jpg/800px-Vladimir_Putin_and_Donald_Trump_at_the_2017_G-20_Hamburg_Summit_%284%29.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Congressional members who opposed impeachment efforts in such a scenario would also suffer.

Very little is known about the shooting and police are still investigating on the motive and suspects behind the killing.</p>\n\n<p>D’Bah was in his 30s when he lost his life and was considered a very significant figure in the community. News about his death has greatly affected his friends and family, who had called up a fundraiser with a $7,500 target -- but ended up raising $15,000.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/ovr4hw7p3/PIC3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Prior to his death, D’Bah had been arrested in February 2017 for disorderly conduct when he jumped a police line and grabbed a flag from a Secessionist member.</p>\n\n<p>The man had been waving the flag outside Sottile Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina,&#160;and was part of a demonstration.

Friends and family have paid tribute to him on Facebook as they try to absorb the shock of his death, while stating that he was a man who lived and served his community and people.</p>\n\n<p>D’Bah’s sudden passing has left many&#160;in shock as the police&#160;assure the community that they are looking into his case and are working on it as hard as they can. He was known to be a fighter of justice by his friends and family and even though some of them disagreed with his methods of expression, they still upheld his message.</p>\n\n<p>According to reports and interviews, droves of people&#160;are&#160;convinced that there is a lot more to his killing than&#160;meets the eye.&#160;</p>\n\n  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/6VjcXFu8e1E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:46:29 +0000","feedId":7836,"bgimg":"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/0000000000-1518107413.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg","linkMd5":"5495d4859077780c868d4c7be3cb7afa","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"\n    Alice Gambo\n  ","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2018/02/0000000000-1518107413.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg":null,"http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/10000/velka/760-1232909406uIfG.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn65@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-42-53-158_81adb5be5cb4ac44.webp","https://s13.postimg.org/ovr4hw7p3/PIC3.jpg":null,"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/1st_Street_Crime_Scene_3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn75@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-42-59-857_89ec5080ff935b85.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~4/6VjcXFu8e1E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn64@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-42-59-172_738e91ca5a609981.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312570069},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:42:50","title":"\n    Kansas City Builds Homeless Veterans A Town  ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opposingviews/main/~3/a4ss6fob5R4/kansas-city-build-homeless-veterans-town-1","description":"\n    <img data-asset_id=\"53119\" class=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://images.opposingviews.com/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2017/12/homelessvet-1514310425.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg\" width=\"670\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Homeless man\" title=\"Homeless man\" /><p>Kansas City's Veterans Community Project knew their homeless veterans didn't have many options: they were either going to spend the rest of their lives poor or end up in jail.</p>\n\n<p>So they took matters into their own hands: with the help of the city's citizens, banks, trade unions, stores, local government officials, lawyers, and more, they literally made them their own town, reports The Kansas City Star.</p>\n\n<p>\"On any given night in Kansas City there are 130 to 200 homeless veterans who sleep on the streets, in the cold, under bridges, in the woods,\" one of the initiative's&#160;co-founders, Chris Stout, said. \"These are the people who took the oath and were willing to die to defend our Constitution of the United States of America ... we are providing housing with dignity.\"</p>\n\n<p>For the past two years, the Veterans Community Project has reportedly worked on creating the tiny Missouri town.

The American Civil Liberties Union said in a press release that the transplant was denied because Lesama-Santos was an undocumented immigrant.</p>\n\n<p>Lesama-Santos, who is a mother of four, has reportedly lived in Oregon for three decades.

They also issued a statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was brought to our attention this evening that an archaic transplant policy was preventing an undocumented individual from being evaluated at OHSU. Upon learning of the policy, OHSU leaders acted immediately and terminated the policy. We deeply regret the pain this has caused the family.</p>\n\n<p>OHSU is committed to serving our entire community -- all are welcome at OHSU, and this policy does not reflect our values.</p>\n\n<p>The OHSU transplant team is informing the family of our change in policy... OHSU's legal team has begun a system-wide audit to ensure no other such policies exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/OHSU_Hospital_front_-_Portland%2C_Oregon.JPG/1600px-OHSU_Hospital_front_-_Portland%2C_Oregon.JPG\" /></p>\n\n<p>The mother's eldest son, Ivan Gonzalez Lesama, started a GoFundMe page.</p>\n\n<p>\"My siblings are young, they are ages four, thirteen, and fifteen, with me being the oldest at 21. &#160;We don't know what we'd do without her,\" the son wrote. \"While my family continues to fight for her life and health as she remains hospitalized, we are asking our community for support with medical expenses.\"</p>\n\n<p>He later said he appreciated everyone for their support.</p>\n\n<p>\"To who this may concern my mother starts the transplant process tomorrow!\" Ivan wrote. \"This is a life changing opportunity that we have been givin!
