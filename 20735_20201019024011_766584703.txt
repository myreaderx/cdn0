The original executive order by President Trump in May said the companies have gone beyond that \"good faith\" in their efforts to remove objectionable content, that they were starting to stifle free speech and showing \"political bias.\" At the time, the executive order came under fire from the FCC\"s two Democratic commissioners, who said the action was \"politically motivated and legally unsound,\" CNBC reported.
