You offer something similar — but, of course, much better.</p>  \n<p>Then, suddenly, your competitor's product is <em>everywhere</em>. News articles, online reviews, best-of lists, buyers' guides, even TV segments.</p> \n<p>How is this happening? And your real question: why isn't it happening to <em>you</em>?</p> \n<p>To compete against your competitors, there's one thing you'll need in your wheelhouse: a media kit.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll explore what a media kit is, and how it can help you increase brand awareness and, ultimately, sales.</p> \n<p>Plus, how to make one for your own brand.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=0adc0556-31bd-4bf1-924b-6a0e48a4bedb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Media Kit Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0adc0556-31bd-4bf1-924b-6a0e48a4bedb.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Media kits may live fully-online as responsive online <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/perfect-press-page\"><span>press pages</span></a>. Or, businesses may choose to make their press kits available as static, downloadable resources, like a presentation deck.</p> \n<p>Whatever format you choose, this much is clear: businesses of all sizes benefit from having a professional, readily-accessible media kit. This vital resource is a key to the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-earned-media-faqs\"><span>earned media coverage</span></a> all businesses covet — from massive Fortune 500 corporations all the way down to individual influencers and solopreneurs.</p> \n<p>A comprehensive media kit should include a description of the company or individual, contact information, social media statistics, case studies, information on partnerships and collaborations, and testimonials from past customers.</p> \n<p>Basically, it's all the information a journalist would need to feature your brand in a breaking news story — without the headache of a last-minute information request.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Make a Media Kit: What to Include</h2> \n<p>So, you want press coverage and partnerships (what brand doesn't?). And you understand how a media kit helps make this all possible. But how do you <em>make</em> a media kit?</p> \n<p>Here's some good news: most of the content and creative assets you need to create your press kit likely already exist.</p> \n<p>Key elements of a media kit include a bio or About Us page, social media statistics, case studies, partnerships and collaborations, and testimonials. To make it even easier for the press to cover your work, you'll want to include high-quality brand identity images (think both logos, and other brand images or product/service images).</p> \n<p>It's up to you to (1) find this information, (2) make it look spectacular, and (3) make it painfully easy to find on your site. The rumors you've heard about journalists and how overworked they are? Entirely true.</p> \n<p>To catch the attention of someone on tight deadlines with an internet full of story prospects, you're going to want to make this simple. Most brands choose a direct page name like \"Press\" or \"Media\" –– or, if they're really fancy, \"Newsroom\" –– and make it accessible directly from their homepage (often in the Footer).</p> \n<p>Even if you prioritize a web version, having a downloadable media kit or deck is worth the time investment. Some media users might prefer the traditional form of this resource, and it gives you the best opportunity to control your pitch and tailor content to all audiences.</p> \n<h3>Biography or About Us</h3> \n<p>Let's start with the star of your media kit: <em>you</em>. Here's where you introduce your name, your logo, your mission. Make sure your media kit design reinforces your overall brand identity, utilizing the colors, fonts, and other visual hallmarks set out in your branding guide.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://evernote.com/about-us\"><span>Evernote</span></a> goes all-out in this section, housing their press kit information within the broader \"About Us\" portion of their website. All the essentials for journalists and partners are there too, but the organization's values take center stage.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Media%20Kit_Evernote-min.png?width=1205&amp;name=Media%20Kit_Evernote-min.png\" alt=\"Evernote's media kit homepage\" width=\"1205\" style=\"width: 1205px;\"></p> \n<h3>Social Statistics</h3> \n<p>For social stats, you'll need to conduct a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/check-pulse-digital-strategy-social-media-audit\"><span>social media audit</span></a> or collect this data from whoever manages your social channels. Remember your audience for the press kit: media and PR professionals.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Your media kit needs to effectively pitch your brand to people who specialize in getting people's attention. So show them you're capable of sparking conversation — and show them there's <em>already</em> an audience eager for stories about you and your work.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/help/brand_assets\"><span>Kickstarter</span></a> puts a unique stamp on this section of their media kit page, highlighting a few top metrics that show massive engagement with their service.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Media%20Kit_Kickstarter-min.png?width=2138&amp;name=Media%20Kit_Kickstarter-min.png\" alt=\"Kickstarter's media kit social media statistics\" width=\"2138\" style=\"width: 2138px;\"></p> \n<p>Media kits aimed at partnerships and collaborations should prioritize <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/vanity-metrics-to-stop-measuring-and-better-alternatives\"><span>engagement rates and similar actionable metrics</span></a> alongside the bread-and-butter statistics like follower counts. Savvy marketers want to partner with brands and influencers that move people to action.</p> \n<p>[Note: If you are a HubSpot Social user, you can use <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social-media-user-guide-v2/how-to-use-the-social-reports-tool\"><span>Reports</span></a> to analyze the performance of your social posts and determine how well your social media efforts are performing.]</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Partnerships and Case Studies</h3> \n<p>This section is your chance to let past partnerships and brand collaborations speak for themselves. Let the old adage \"<em>show; don't tell</em>\" be your guide here. Featuring the right partnerships –– either via logos or through short case studies –– is a subtle but powerful tool for positioning your brand.</p> \n<p>International football influencers <a href=\"http://thef2.com/campaigns/\"><span>The F2</span></a> highlight past campaigns, putting reputable brand names and logos front-and-center.

Want your logo and that slick product screenshot to display correctly?</p> \n<p>Provide exactly the images and files you want featured. Have a killer data visualization, infographic, or product video? Include that, too.</p> \n<p>Journalists will especially appreciate portraits of your management team. They're most likely to cover stories involving people, so show them the people they'll want to write about.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.birchbox.com/press/news\"><span>Birchbox</span></a> makes this easy. They highlight \"Press Materials\" and link to a short but comprehensive set of resources.

Remember, the audience for your media kit is especially busy and juggling lots of competing priorities. Jump to the top of their \"potential posts\" pile by making their job as easy and painless as possible.</p> \n<p>(Added bonus: your external media resources are easily updated –– sparing you anxiety about outdated media kits and image files misrepresenting your brand.)</p> \n<h2>Media Kit Design</h2> \n<p>Now that you know what to include in your media kit, you might be wondering how to put all of that valuable information together so that it’s navigable and easy to understand. You’ll do this through a table of contents.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The way your table of contents looks can vary depending on how you design your media kit. On Slack’s website, its media kit has a table of contents that features summaries of each section with hyperlinks that bring users to a separate page, as shown in the image below.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/slack%20website.jpg?width=1480&amp;name=slack%20website.jpg\" alt=\"slack website media kit table of contents\" width=\"1480\" style=\"width: 1480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://slack.com/media-kit\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>If you download Slack’s media kit as a PDF, the table of contents lists a page number for each section, so viewers can quickly scroll to the page they need or type the page number into the search bar.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/slack%20image%202.jpeg?width=1650&amp;name=slack%20image%202.jpeg\" alt=\"slack downloadable media kit table of contents\" width=\"1650\" style=\"width: 1650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://slack.com/media-kit\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Regardless of how you present your kit, it needs to be designed for ease of access. Aim to create distinct sections for the content you’re including, and create a form of navigation that helps those making inquiries quickly find what they need.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Let’s go over some high-quality examples of media kits that you can use for inspiration when creating one for your business.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Media Kit Examples</h2> \n<h3>1. Hinge</h3> \n<p>Hinge, a dating app, has a straightforward and easy to navigate press kit that gives those doing media inquiries quick access to critical information, like internal press releases:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hinge%20image%201.jpg?width=2642&amp;name=hinge%20image%201.jpg\" alt=\"press kit example: hinge media kit\" width=\"2642\" style=\"width: 2642px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://hinge.co/press/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>As well as external news articles, employee profiles, business background, and image downloads (logo, screenshots, etc.).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hinge%20image%202.png?width=2752&amp;name=hinge%20image%202.png\" alt=\"press kit example: hinge media kit downloadables\" width=\"2752\" style=\"width: 2752px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://hinge.co/press/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>2.

After all, Stories can provide great benefits related to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories\">audience engagement, brand awareness, and even purchase-related conversions</a>.</p> \n<p>Despite the growing number of benefits that Instagram Stories offers brands, crafting good content still takes time, energy, and brainstorming.

According to this survey, 78% of marketers leverage Instagram Stories in their roles. Of those who use Instagram Stories, 43% post on behalf of their brand multiple times per week. The marketers in this survey note audience viewership of Instagram Stories declines after four to six Instagram Story pages.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the marketers we surveyed, here are the most common Instagram Story types subjects that result in the greatest ROI.</p> \n<h3>Content That Reflects Brand Values</h3> \n<p>Per the HubSpot Blog survey, 18% of marketers indicated Instagram Story content that reflected their brand’s values produced the greatest ROI. Considering <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2020/02/brand-values-alignment.html\"><span>71% of consumers</span></a> want to buy from brands that align with their personal values, this piece of data isn’t surprising.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When companies are upfront about their core values related to topics such as diversity, inclusion, sustainability, and human rights, buyers are able to quickly determine a brand’s stance on a particular topic.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Similarly, it’s important that consumers know why your brand exists, and how you can serve them. Regularly incorporating your company’s mission and vision into your content can also help your audience feel more connected to your brand.</p> \n<h3>Product-Focused Content</h3> \n<p>Consumers want to see your product in action! Whether it is through regular demonstrations by your team, user-generated content from other happy customers, or positive reviews, product-related content can deliver positive results. When crafting Instagram Stories, find creative ways to present your products that appeal to your audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Interactive Content</h3> \n<p>On Instagram Stories, interactive frames have a specific call-to-action or way viewers can get involved from within the app. This often includes using Instagram’s Poll or Quiz sticker, inviting users to share a specific piece of content themselves, or a game. Here’s an example from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fentybeauty/\">@fentybeauty</a>, who used Instagram’s slide feature to poll their audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Interactive-Content-Example.jpg?width=200&amp;name=Interactive-Content-Example.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Story Format: an example of an interactive Instagram Story\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>Trendy Content</h3> \n<p>Trend-related content entails coverage of a recent cultural moment or news story. This type of content can range from informative (breaking news) to humorous (posting a meme related to a recent event). Trendy content is well-suited for Instagram Stories because of it is best consumed quickly and while relevant. Unlike a feed post that can take days to reach an audience, the 24-hour period an Instagram Story is live can be a great place to share content that is only relevant for a short period of time.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now that we know what content marketers are prioritizing in Instagram Stories, let’s look at what formats consumers prefer and engage with most often.</p> \n<h2>Which Format Consumers Are Actually Watching</h2> \n<p>While some brands and users post Stories focused purely on interactive features, others might post visual storytelling content such as short narratives or longer video stories that feel more like documentaries.</p> \n<p>But, which one of the many Instagram Story formats is most intriguing to people? To get to the bottom of which Story style is most engaging, I surveyed 350 people using <a href=\"https://luc.id/\">Lucid</a> software to learn more about their favorite Story formats, sound preferences, and ideal Story length.</p> \n<p>I asked consumers, \"Which Instagram Story are you most likely to tap all the way through until the end?\"</p> \n<p>At this point, you may have your own predictions of how people might have voted. While research says that interactive stickers, such as Quizzes, Polls, or Questions are highly engaging, you might also be thinking about the times you've tapped through an influencer or brand's behind-the-scenes videos via their Story. So which, ultimately did people choose?</p> \n<p>Stories centered around Quiz or Poll stickers were one of the most popular formats with 15% of the votes. However, 35% of consumers <em>actually</em> prefer short narratives with a mix of photos, text, and videos.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats.png\" alt=\"Which types of Instagram Stories do you tap all the way through?\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Data Source: </em><a href=\"http://luc.id/\">Lucid Software</a></p> \n<h3>Short Narrative Stories</h3> \n<p>Short narratives are basically articles translated for a more visual audience. They rely on brief paragraphs and bullet points of text, accompanied by related visuals, to tell a story in a few cohesive short slides. Here's a great example of a short story that swipes up to a longer piece of web content from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">Harvard Business Review</a>:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-3.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-3.png\" alt=\"Harvard Business Review Instagram Story\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>This strategy is a great way to get more eyes on your blog content without asking people to leave the Instagram app.</p> \n<p>Aside from informing your audience of a topic related to your industry, you can also take a note from HBR and other publishers by using Stories as a traffic generator. In the example above, HBR — which has a verified account — has adapted a long-form article into a short Story and included the full post at the end as a swipe-up link.</p> \n<p>With this tactic, the Instagram Story serves as a teaser as viewers who are very interested in the topic can swipe up to read more about it on HBR.org.</p> \n<h3>Quiz or Poll-Centered Stories</h3> \n<p>Another strong Story format uses Quiz or Poll stickers. Essentially, these Stories feel like they are just created to quiz the viewer by including the Quiz sticker on most pages, or brands can leverage Stories with polls primarily on each page to get their audience's insights on a topic.</p> \n<p>These Stories are intriguing and entertaining to viewers because it allows them to test themselves and learn about a new topic interactively, or vote in a poll and see what other audiences think about a certain topic or theme. Here's an example of an interactive Story from HubSpot which centered around a Poll-styled quiz and revealed the answers at the end.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-4.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-4.png\" alt=\"HubSpot Poll Instagram Story\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>While you can also use an actual Quiz sticker, which will immediately tell viewers quiz questions, HubSpot's strategy also works as it allows viewers to get a glimpse at what others guessed and see a rundown of the actual answers at the end. This might keep viewers engaged, entertained, and in the Story for longer if they know that there will be a payoff on the last page.</p> \n<p>While fewer people voted for Stories centered around <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-questions\">Question stickers</a>, this feature could still be a great feature to experiment with as it can help you interact with and learn more about your audience in a more open-ended way that Polls.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a Question sticker in a HubSpot Story. After this page, the Story went on to share the answers that viewers submitted.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-11.png?width=200&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-11.png\" alt=\"HubSpot Questions INstagram Story\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Although open-ended questions seem like a great way to learn about and interact with your audience, keep in mind that viewers will need to take time to fill out answers rather than simply tapping on a Poll or Quiz sticker. This means that if your audience isn't as interested in the topic or question, you might run into issues getting responses.</p> \n<p>If you'd like to learn more about how to use and leverage the Instagram Questions sticker in your Stories, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-questions\">this helpful guide</a> which includes examples of brands that used the feature successfully.</p> \n<h3>Demos and Tutorials</h3> \n<p>Brands can also leverage tutorials and demos, which was the fifth most popular Story style. This tactic might be especially helpful if you're interested in ecommerce or purchase-related conversions as a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing\">growing number of people prefer to learn more about products via video.</a> Here's an example of a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-product-research\">tutorial from Kylie Cosmetics</a>, where CEO Kylie Jenner puts on a new lip liner from the brand.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-8.png?width=200&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-8.png\" alt=\"Kylie Cosmetics Instagram Story Tutorial\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Story formats that include demos or tutorials can be advantageous to brands because it allows them to show off how their products work. Additionally, if you have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/add-link-instagram-story\">over 10,000 followers or are a verified user</a>, you can link these Stories to your ecommerce site or a purchasing page for the products shown. This way, if a viewer is impressed by a tutorial or demo, they can simply swipe up to learn more about or purchase the product.</p> \n<h3>A Mix of Content</h3> \n<p>Because many people don't have a preference or prefer a mix of multiple elements in Instagram Stories, be sure to add a bit of variation to your content strategy. For example, brainstorm ways to add interactive features, such as Quiz or Poll stickers to narratives, tutorials, or other types of Story content. This will add an extra layer of engaging content to a Story that might already be interesting to viewers.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">Story from Starbucks</a> that mixes in storytelling and interactive stickers to announce the return of a popular seasonal beverage:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-5.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-5.png\" alt=\"Starbucks Instagram Story\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h2>Other Instagram Story Formats</h2> \n<p>When it came to the Story styles with lower rankings, consumers were actually less interested in behind-the-scenes content, mini-documentaries, and Stories that center around customer testimonials.</p> \n<p>This might hint that marketers on these platforms might want to be thinking more creatively when launching content on Instagram Stories. Rather than just focusing on your product or customer testimonials, you might want to test out creating informative short narratives or interactive Stories that relate strongly to your brand. While this will engage Instagram audiences, it might also show off your company's expertise in its industry.</p> \n<p>While this poll deemed a few Story formats less engaging, I still encourage you to mix things up and experiment with some of these styles just in case they work for you. Here are a few to try.</p> \n<h3>Customer Testimonials</h3> \n<p>Although customer testimonials aren't as interesting to consumers, this doesn't mean that you should scratch them entirely. In fact, they're still a commonly used tactic in many brands and industries, despite consumer preferences. For example, a number of companies, like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">Planet Fitness</a>, have built their strategy around testimonials. Here's an example:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-7.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-7.png\" alt=\"Planet Fitness Instagram Story\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>In the above scenario, the customer testimonial strategy works for Planet Fitness because it helps gym prospects feel less intimidated and more motivated to take on physical fitness after seeing a customer's success story.</p> \n<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Stories</h3> \n<p>No, behind-the-scenes Stories don't necessarily talk about your product front and center, but they can give prospects an idea of what your company is like, the inner workings of your industry, and a look at the staff that customers could work with.</p> \n<p>Behind-the-scenes videos allow you to show off how hardworking or relatable your business might be, which might make viewers feel more comfortable working with you.</p> \n<p>One example of a brand that uses this technique is the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">NBA</a>. The basketball league regularly <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">shares videos of professional basketball players behind the scenes</a> at games or celebrations. In the image below, they shared an Instagram Story video of basketball players taking a photo with the rapper Drake:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-1.png?width=200&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-1.png\" alt=\"NBA Instagram Story\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>Mini-Documentaries</h3> \n<p>Like narrative-style Instagram content, mini-documentaries tell journalistic stories that are slightly more complex and primarily centered on video -- like a documentary that you tap through.</p> \n<p>These are often higher-quality and incredibly informative, so they are more prominently used by publishers such as National Geographic. Here's just the beginning of a long documentary-styled Story where NatGeo visits NASA's offices to uncover facts about the first moon landing:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image-3750.png?width=600&amp;name=image-3750.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"NASA Instagram Story\"></p> \n<p>If you're a small to medium-sized business that's just ramping up your Instagram strategy, you might want to stick to a short narrative Story, like the ones noted at the beginning of this post. These will allow you to similarly show a combination of videos, photos, and text without as much production time and effort. However, if you're a content creator or feel like covering an event or newsworthy topic in your industry might boost brand awareness, you might want to experiment with this longer-form, in-depth visual storytelling style.</p> \n<h2>Ideal Story Length</h2> \n<p>For years, social media managers have been trying to determine how long the perfect Instagram Story should be. This has been such a major question that marketing blogs and publications have <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-biggest-instagram-stories-research-study-done-to-date-552662f6952b\">done further research on the matter</a>.</p> \n<p>If you're a small to medium-sized business marketer, Story length is a valid thing to consider, especially if you have low time or resources. While you ideally want to engage people with low dropoff throughout your entire Story, you might not want to spend time making incredibly long pieces of content with multiple pages if you know people in your industry usually only tap through a small number of pages.</p> \n<p>So, what exactly is a good Story length? To get some added insight on this, I surveyed the 350 consumers and asked them, \"On average, how many pages of an Instagram Story will you tap through before swiping out?\"</p> \n<p>Before looking at the results, you might think \"The ideal Story should be as short as possible,\" simply because it's content on a fast-paced social media platform. But, then, you might also remember that a number of publications, like Harvard Business Publishing and The Washington Post have leveraged Stories as a way to share long-form content.</p> \n<p>So, which approach is right and which is wrong?'</p> \n<p>It seems that there are solid themes in ideal Story length, however, there still might not be an ideal number of pages in this type of content.</p> \n<p>According to the poll, 63% of consumers will tap through six pages or less, with 34% saying they tap through four to six pages on average. This data aligns with the feedback we got from marketers through our HubSpot Blog survey. However, more than one-third of consumers will tap through stories with more than seven pages, with 20% saying they'll tap through 10 or more.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-6.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-6.png\" alt=\"How long should an Instagram Story be?\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Data Source: </em><a href=\"http://luc.id/\">Lucid Software</a></p> \n<p>The results above are similar to research published by Buffer which noted that Stories made up of <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-biggest-instagram-stories-research-study-done-to-date-552662f6952b\">seven or fewer pages are the most engaging</a>. However, the fact that a large chunk of Lucid respondents will watch beyond seven pages hints that you might not need to shrink down your content to ensure that it's seen.</p> \n<p>When determining the best Story length for your audience, we encourage you to consider the age group of your audience, the type of topics they engage with, and how fast-paced their lifestyles might be. If you have an idea for a great topic that your audience will love and is compatible with interactive Story features, you might be able to get away with a longer Story.</p> \n<p>If you have a topic that you worry might feel dry or too complex to explain on Stories, you might want to format this as a smaller Story with a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-swipe-up-removal\">sticker linked to longer-form content</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As you start posting regular Instagram Stories, you should also experiment with both long and short Stories. Then, look at the drop-off rate of each Story. If many people seem to drop out of one long story but not another, this might be due to the topic or the writing rather than the length. However, if people regularly drop out of your longer-form Stories around a certain page number, you might want to limit your Story content to that number of pages.</p> \n<h2>Telling an Engaging Visual Story</h2> \n<p>Regardless of what topic you're publishing a Story about, or which format you decide on using, make sure it informs the audience about something they care about, provides entertainment value, and highlights your brand's credibility in your industry.</p> \n<p>If you're unsure about how you can leverage Instagram Stories to better market your brand, it can be helpful to look at examples from similar companies in your industry.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5848cf64-d1ce-4245-8440-eaffd08f875a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

I want to create a drop-down menu so I can easily go in and change the status of the campaign as time goes on.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"table in google sheets with a drop-down menu\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-02-PM.png?width=553&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-02-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 553px;\" title=\"\" width=\"553\"></p> \n<p>Before going through the steps, it might be helpful to see what a drop-down menu looks like so you can contextually understand each instruction. The gif below shows a final drop-down menu and how it applies to the sample data set.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/completed%20drop%20down%20menu.png?width=571&amp;name=completed%20drop%20down%20menu.png\" alt=\"completed drop down menu\" width=\"571\" style=\"width: 571px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Let’s go over how to add a drop-down list to your Sheet.</p> \n<p>1. In the toolbar header, click <em>Data</em>.</p> \n<p>2. In the drop-down menu, as shown in the image below, select <em>Data validation</em>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"google sheets drop-down menu step 1: select data in the header toolbar\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-1.png?width=249&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 249px;\" title=\"\" width=\"249\"></p> \n<p>3. In the <em>Data validation</em>&nbsp;dialog box, enter the range of cells you want to have a drop-down menu in <em>Cell range</em>. For this example, I’m entering B2:B10 for cells 2-10 in column B.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"google sheets drop-down menu step 3: add your cell range\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-2.png?width=439&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 439px;\" title=\"\" width=\"439\"></p> \n<p>4. The next step is to enter the data range that you want to be included in the drop-down menu. Select <em>List of items</em>, and add in your menu values. For this example, this is where I would input Not yet started, In progress, and Complete.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve entered your values, click save.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"google sheets drop-down menu step 4: enter your list item criteria\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-4.png?width=509&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"509\"></p> \n<p>5. Each of your cells should now have a clickable down arrow, as shown in the image below.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"google sheets drop-down menu arrows\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-84-PM.png?width=579&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-84-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 579px;\" title=\"\" width=\"579\"></p> \n<p>For the example table, I can click on each down arrow and change the status of my campaigns as time goes on.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step%206-1.gif?width=569&amp;name=step%206-1.gif\" alt=\"step 6-1\" width=\"569\" style=\"width: 569px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h2>How to Edit a Drop-down List in Google Sheets</h2> \n<p>If you need to make changes to your drop-down menu, the process is rather simple.</p> \n<p>1. In the toolbar header, click <em>Data</em>&nbsp;and then <em>Data validation</em>.</p> \n<p>2. In the <em>Data validation</em>&nbsp;dialogue box, simply input the changes you want to make. For example,</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If you want to change the items in your drop-down menu, navigate to <em>Criteria</em>, and make your desired changes.</li> \n <li>If you want to change the column the drop-down menu is in, change the cell numbers in <em>Cell range</em>.</li> \n <li>If you want to delete your drop-down menu altogether, select the column the menu is currently in and click <em>Remove validation</em>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Always click save after making all changes.</p> \n<h2>Color Code a Drop-down List in Google Sheets</h2> \n<p>Color coding is helpful when it comes to interpreting results at a glance. You can do this with your drop-down list by creating conditional formatting rules, and below we’ll explain how.</p> \n<p>1. Select the cells your drop-down menu is in and click <em>Format</em>.</p> \n<p>2. Select <em>Conditional formatting</em>&nbsp;from the dialogue box, as shown in the image below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"color code google sheets drop down menu step 2: click format in header toolbar\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-3.png?width=265&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-3.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 265px;\" title=\"\" width=\"265\"></p> \n<p>3. In the <em>Conditional formatting rules</em>&nbsp;sidebar on the right-hand side of your screen, navigate to the <em>Format rules</em>&nbsp;section.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"color code google sheets drop down menu step 3: select format rules\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down.png?width=247&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 247px;\" title=\"\" width=\"247\"></p> \n<p>4. In the <em>Format cells</em>&nbsp;if menu, select <em>Text contains…</em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"color code google sheets drop down menu step 4: select text contains\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-53-08-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>5. Enter the first element in your drop-down list that you want color-coded. In the image below, I’ve entered Completed<em>&nbsp;</em>as my value and set the color to Green.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-29-PM.png?height=343&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-29-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" height=\"343\"></p> \n<p>6. To set a color for each of your list items, select <em>+ Add another rule </em>and repeat step 5 for each value. For my chart, I’ve set In progress to Blue, and Not started to gray.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"color coded google sheets drop-down menu\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-59-PM.png?width=624&amp;height=292&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-59-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"292\"></p> \n<p>7. After you set each of your rules, changing the drop-down menu item to a different value will automatically change it to the correct color. For example, if I change Not yet started to In progress, it turns from gray to blue.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step%2019.gif?width=600&amp;name=step%2019.gif\" alt=\"step 19\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Once you’ve created your drop-down menu and color-coded it for easy interpretation, you can continue to track the progress of your different marketing activities and save time while doing so.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=0cedc81d-d358-4517-bd55-4a26f49c5a4e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

More businesses are exploring the platform.</h3> \n<p>According to HubSpot Blog Research, TikTok is the number one platform marketers are increasing their investments in for 2022.</p> \n<p>For a long time, businesses didn’t take TikTok seriously. They saw it as a platform for Gen-Z to make short, funny videos.</p> \n<p>However, when its popularity (and user growth) peaked in 2020, businesses gave it a second look.</p> \n<p>Today, marketers say it’s the fourth most effective social media platform behind Instagram, FB, and YouTube. That puts it ahead of established platforms like Twitter and Pinterest.</p> \n<p>What makes TikTok special is its ability to build community. In fact, 78% of users agree that the best brands on TikTok are ones that work together with users, according to <a href=\"https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/whats_next.html\">TikTok’s 2021 \"What’s Next\" report</a>.</p> \n<p>The report also found 67% of users feel inspired to shop even when they weren’t originally planning to.</p> \n<p>Brands are starting to realize that while users may first go on the platform for funny videos, they stay for the authenticity and community building – which are great pillars for brand loyalty.</p> \n<h3>2. TikTok users are consuming less of other content.</h3> \n<p>What would you do with your audience’s undivided attention?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/time-well-spent\">According to Kantar research</a>, 46% of users engage with content on the platform without any other distractions.</p> \n<p>More specifically, 41% of<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tiktok-influencer-agency-tips-for-creating-gen-z-content\"> Gen Z TikTok users</a> say they listen to fewer podcasts after joining TikTok and 33% say they watch less TV.</p> \n<p>This is an incredible opportunity for social media marketers to capitalize on this attention to reel in their audience and drive more engagement.</p> \n<h3>3. Sounds are more important than hashtags.</h3> \n<p>On no other social media platform does sound play such a pivotal role.</p> \n<p>88% of people on TikTok report that the sound on the platform is central to the overall app experience, according to TikTok’s \"What’s Next\" report.</p> \n<p>The report also revealed that sounds saw 47% higher video view rates on 2021 from the \"For You\" page when compared to hashtags.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://invideo.io/blog/tiktok-brand-marketing-report/\">Invideo’s TikTok Brand Marketing Report</a> found that 80% of the top videos had music, with upbeat songs being the most popular TikTok music choice by far.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, brands should prioritize the use of sounds when <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/when-to-post-tiktok\">posting on the platform</a>. While hashtags are effective in helping you reach your target audience, choosing the right sound will likely be more effective.</p> \n<h2>How to Find TikTok Trends</h2> \n<h3>1. The \"Discover\" Tab</h3> \n<p>One of the best ways to find trends on Tiktok is through the \"Discover\" tab.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok discover tab to find trends\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-1.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\" title=\"how to find tiktok trends: the discover tab\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p>On this tab, you can scroll through popular sounds, hashtags, and topics along with a preview of the top videos within the category.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok discover tab to find trends\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-4.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-4.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 250px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p>You can also see how many videos fall within that category, which gives you an insight into which trends are rising and which ones have already blown up.</p> \n<h3>2. The \"For You\" Page</h3> \n<p>TikTok’s \"For You\" page is like Instagram’s Explore page. It looks different for every user based on the content they engage with the most.</p> \n<p>With that said, it’s also where trending topics make their rounds.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok for you page to find trends\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-2.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 250px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p>If a video has hundreds of thousands of likes or views, it’s worth digging a bit to see if it’s related to a particular trend. Your first step should be checking the sound, located on the bottom left corner of the video.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok for you page\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-3.jpeg?width=300&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-3.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 300px;\" title=\"how to find tiktok trend for you page\" width=\"300\"></p> \n<p>Once you click on it, you’ll see the name of the song, the number of videos that use it, and scroll to see the videos that feature it. With all this information, you’ll know how popular a sound is and how other users are leveraging it.</p> \n<h3>3. The \"Search\" Tab</h3> \n<p>TikTok’s search tab is another great way to discover new trends.</p> \n<p>Before you start typing in the search bar, TikTok auto-populates suggested searches based on trending topics.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok search bar to find trends\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022.jpeg?width=300&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 300px;\" title=\"\" width=\"300\"></p> \n<p>All you have to do is then click on relevant searches and see what videos have been created surrounding these topics.</p> \n<h3>4. The #TrendAlert Hashtag</h3> \n<p>Now, let’s say you leverage all the strategies mentioned above and you’re still struggling to identify trends.</p> \n<p>Well, there are a ton of users on TikTok who are already on top of it. All you have to do is follow them or the hashtag #TrendAlert.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@strategisewithcare/video/7066856216848387334\" style=\"max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;\"> \n <a title=\"@strategisewithcare\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@strategisewithcare\">@strategisewithcare</a> \n <a title=\"socialmediamanageruk\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/socialmediamanageruk\">#socialmediamanageruk</a> \n <a title=\"trendalert\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trendalert\">#trendalert</a> \n <a title=\"contentcreatortips\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/contentcreatortips\">#contentcreatortips</a> \n <a title=\"smallbusinesstips_\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/smallbusinesstips_\">#smallbusinesstips_</a> \n <a title=\"trendpredictions\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trendpredictions\">#trendpredictions</a> \n <a title=\"trendingnow\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trendingnow\">#trendingnow</a> \n <a title=\"tiktoktips\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktoktips\">#tiktoktips</a> \n <a title=\"trendalert2022\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trendalert2022\">#trendalert2022</a> \n <a title=\"contentideas\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/contentideas\">#contentideas</a> \n <a title=\"♬ original sound - Betelgeusethestar\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7064658646256651009\">♬ original sound - Betelgeusethestar</a> \n</blockquote>  \n<p>As shown in the video, you can leverage this hashtag to discover new trends and how to use them.</p> \n<h2>How to Do TikTok Trends</h2> \n<h3>1. Jump in early.</h3> \n<p>The thing about trends is that they come and go very quickly. If you don’t jump in early, you might miss the boat altogether.</p> \n<p>So, as soon as you identify a TikTok trend you want to participate in, start brainstorming some ideas.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that you don’t need fancy videography to succeed on the platform. Often, all it takes is some creative thinking, good lighting, some lip-syncing skills, and a phone.</p> \n<p>Authenticity is essential on a platform like TikTok. If you keep that at the forefront, your odds of success are that much higher.</p> \n<h3>2. Find a relatable angle.</h3> \n<p>On TikTok, you only have up to three minutes to make an impression but a good chunk of videos that go viral are 30 seconds or less.</p> \n<p>This means you have a short ramp-up period to get viewers to stop and watch your video. One way to do this? Create relatable content.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thelipbar/video/6826854225931193606\" style=\"max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;\"> \n <a title=\"@thelipbar\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thelipbar\">@thelipbar</a> I mean... it’s hard to resist our \n <a title=\"fastface\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fastface\">#fastface</a> makeup system 😍 \n <a title=\"thelipbar\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/thelipbar\">#thelipbar</a> \n <a title=\"easymakeup\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/easymakeup\">#easymakeup</a> \n <a title=\"vegan\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/vegan\">#vegan</a> \n <a title=\"vegancosmetics\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/vegancosmetics\">#vegancosmetics</a> \n <a title=\"fyp\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp\">#fyp</a> \n <a title=\"foryou\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou\">#foryou</a> \n <a title=\"♬ original sound - Makayla\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6776283960856169222\">♬ original sound - Makayla</a> \n</blockquote>  \n<p>Think about the challenges your audience faces on a day-to-day. That’s a great place to get inspiration from.</p> \n<p>You can also get inspired by your competitors and the content they’re creating.</p> \n<h3>3. Know when to bow out.</h3> \n<p>Every day, there’s a new TikTok trend.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, not every trend is worth joining in. This could be because it doesn’t align with your brand voice and values, or because you missed the boat.</p> \n<p>Whatever the reason, avoid joining trends long after they’ve peaked. At that point, users may be over the trend and actively avoid it. It can also make your brand seem out of touch.</p> \n<p>TikTok trends are always evolving. If you leverage the tools mentioned here, you can join the trends as they happen and reach an ever-growing audience.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7a03a7b4-d90f-4c86-b845-fae9305669ea&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

Getting Hired</em> and <em>Hire With Your Head</em>, <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/lou-adler/best-interview-question-ever.html\">spent 10 years</a> searching for the single best interview question that will reveal whether to hire or not hire a candidate — and this was the one.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>Candidates' answers will tell you about their prior success and sense of ownership. A great answer will show they are confident in their work and professional choices while being humble enough to show they care about the <em>company's</em> success. For example, if a candidate built a sales or marketing campaign they're particularly proud of, listen for them to explain how the business benefited from it. Did it help the company sign a major client?</p> \n<h4>2. \"Is it better to be perfect and late, or good and on time?\"</h4> \n<p>If your candidate responds with \"It depends,\" hear them out — the interview question itself is phrased in such a way that candidates can sense there is a right and wrong answer, and they'll be looking for signs from you that they're heading in the right direction.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>For most companies, the correct answer is \"good and on time.\" It's important to let something be finished when it's good enough. Let's face it, every blog post, email, book, video, etc. can <em>always</em> be tweaked and improved. At some point, you've just got to ship it. Most managers don't want someone who can't hit deadlines because they're paralyzed by perfection.</p> \n<p>Try to remain neutral as they feel out their response, though. They might not be able to relate to work that's measured purely by quality and deadline, but it's important that they can express how they prioritize their tasks.</p> \n<h4>3. \"Tell me about a time you screwed up.\"</h4> \n<p>An oldie but goodie. This is a tried-and-true test for self-awareness. (Honestly, well-prepared candidates should see it coming and have an answer ready.) Someone who takes ownership of their mess-up and learns something from it is usually humble and mindful. Candidates who blame others or give a \"fake\" screw-up (something like \"I worked too hard and burned out.\") are red flags.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>A good answer to this question will do two things well:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Admit to a genuine mistake.</strong> Often candidates will dress up a mistake with a self-compliment or excuse to avoid looking weak. For example, <em>\"I was so committed to X that I overlooked Y.\"</em> On the contrary, good answers will just show that they miscalculated, plain and simple.</li> \n <li><strong>Explain what they learned from it.</strong> It's one thing to screw up, but it's another thing to take that screw-up as an opportunity to improve. Great companies learn more from failure than they do from success — candidates who do too are exactly what you need to grow.</li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Questions to Test a Candidate's Work Ethic</h3> \n<h4>4. \"Tell me about a time you set difficult goals.\"</h4> \n<p>If you're looking for a candidate who is goal-oriented and results-driven — as most hiring managers are — this question will help you gauge whether they'll be able to handle the audacious goals you have in store for them. Ask follow-up questions like, \"What did you do to achieve them?\" Have the candidate walk you through the process and purpose of the goals they set out for themselves.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>A good answer to this interview question shows they understand what difficult goals are, and that they put a lot of effort into attaining their goals while maintaining a high standard of work quality. Listen for answers that describe a lofty goal and show <em>why</em> this goal challenged their normal targets. Responses that admit the candidate came up short of this goal can also indicate self-awareness and confidence despite a lack of success.</p> \n<h4>5. \"What have you done professionally that is not an experience you'd want to repeat?\"</h4> \n<p>A candidate's answer to this question will give you an idea of how they viewed work they weren't very happy with, which is bound to happen to everyone in every job at one point or another.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>HubSpot's VP of Customer Service and Support <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mredbord\">Michael Redbord</a> says candidates' answers generally fall into a few categories:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Something menial</strong> (e.g. envelope-stuffing). Pay attention to whether they understand the value of this getting done for the business, or whether they just think they're too good for a job like that.</li> \n <li><strong>Something really hard.</strong> Why was it hard? Was it because it was poorly planned, poorly executed, or something else? Where do they put the blame on it being such an unpleasant experience?</li> \n <li><strong>Something team-related.</strong> Follow up with questions about the team, what their role on the team was, and so on.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Even the category of what they consider an experience they wouldn't want to repeat is interesting, says Redbord. When you talk about extreme experiences that get people emotional, it can be very revealing. Keep in mind, however, that good answers don't have to fall into any one category — what's most important is if they extracted value from the experience despite their lack of interest in doing it again.</p> \n<h4>6. \"What is your definition of hard work?\"</h4> \n<p>Some organizations move at very different paces, and this question is an effective way to tell whether your candidate will be able to keep pace with the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-build-a-marketing-team\">rest of your team and add value to your team</a>. It also helps you identify someone who is a \"hard worker in disguise,\" meaning someone who might currently be at a slow-moving organization or in a role that is not well-suited to them, but wants to work somewhere where they can really get their hands dirty.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>A good answer doesn't have to produce evidence of hard work — it should rather reveal if your candidate knows what it takes to get something done and solve the problems it was designed to solve.</p> \n<p>Answers that talk about working hard by working <em>smart</em> are great, as well. Always listen for this — putting in the work to find the <em>best way</em> of doing something is often just as important as the task itself.</p> \n<h4>7. \"Who is the smartest person you know personally? Why?\"</h4> \n<p>These questions test what the candidate values and aspires to by forcing them to think of a real person they know, and then articulate what makes that person smart.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>Ideal answers vary, but could include specific examples of the person they've chosen's ability to think ahead several steps and execute. They could also touch on the person's decision-making skills, ability to connect, desire for learning, or application of the things they learned.</p> \n<h4>8. \"What’s the biggest decision you’ve had to make in the past year? Why was it so big?\"</h4> \n<p>Here's a great way to figure out how a candidate approaches decision-making. Were they quick to make that big decision, or did it take them a long time? Did they spend most of their time reflecting on it by themselves or fleshing it out with others? How did they make a plan?</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>Candidates' answers could be work-related or personal. In addition to revealing their thought process, as described above, an effective response to this interview question will also show how the candidate was able to prioritize what was most important when each possible option might have had its own advantages and disadvantages.</p> \n<p>If your candidate had hiring power in a previous position, for example, maybe they found it hard to choose between two job candidates of their own. A good answer might show that they saw immediate skill in one candidate but long-term potential in the other. Although both people had usable strengths, your candidate chose the second person because he or she offered he best return on investment.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/best%20interview%20questions-1.png?width=1080&amp;name=best%20interview%20questions-1.png\" alt=\"best interview questions\" width=\"1080\" style=\"width: 1080px;\"></p> \n<h3>Questions to Test a Candidate's Interests, Passions, &amp; Working Style&nbsp;</h3> \n<h4>9. \"Tell me about the relationships you've had with the people you've worked with. How would you describe the best ones? The worst?\"</h4> \n<p>Each team is different, so this question helps you tease out whether the candidate would be happy, productive, and well liked on <em>your </em>team. Their answer will tell you how they interact with others — and which kinds of interactions they <em>want</em> to happen.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>Answers to this question don't have to focus on just professional elements of a relationship with colleagues — they can also be related to business culture. Maybe the candidate enjoyed their coworker's positivity or thought their attitude lowered morale. Good responses aren't one-sided, though. Look for answers that explain how their colleague's work style thrived (or conflicted) with their own — not simply what their colleague did that benefited or offended them.</p> \n<p>Many candidates are hesitant to bad-mouth their coworkers and bosses, so it'll be interesting for you to hear how they navigate a question about their worst working relationships.</p> \n<h4>10. \"In five minutes, could you explain something to me that is complicated but you know well?\"</h4> \n<p>This is a much better test of intelligence than a college GPA, and it's also a great gauge of a candidate's passion and charisma outside of their core job responsibilities. Candidates who are passionate and knowledgeable about something — and can convey that well — are more likely to be enthusiastic and influential at work.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>The \"something\" in this question doesn't have to be work-related — it can be a hobby, a sports team, something technical ... anything, really. Good responses will tell you how well your candidate comprehends complex subjects and that they can articulate that subject to someone who doesn't know much about it.</p> \n<p>Explanations that use analogies also make good answers, especially if it's a topic that is filled with industry jargon. This shows that the candidate can solve problems by drawing comparisons to things that are more universally understood.</p> \n<h4>11. \"If I were to poll everyone you've worked with, what percentage would not be a fan of yours?\"</h4> \n<p>At work, you can't please everyone all the time. The answer to this question will help you find out if your candidate has enough drive and conviction in their own work to have ever conflicted with one or more of their colleagues.</p> \n<p>Obviously you don't want the candidate to be an unlikable person, though, so consider asking follow-up questions to find out <em>why</em> they might have alienated these coworkers: \"If I were to interview these people, what words would they most frequently use to describe you?\"</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>The follow-up question about word choice is more important than the percentage they give in the initial question. In their answers, you should be encouraged by words like \"passionate\" and concerned by words like \"lazy.\"</p> \n<p>Of course, not all negative words are red flags — while words that indicate a lack of work ethic might be a bad sign, words like \"stubborn\" could show a candidate's self-awareness — and commitment to things their coworkers would rather move on from.</p> \n<h4>12. \"What is something you'd be happy doing every single day for the rest of your career?\"</h4> \n<p>While it's important to hire for skill, it's also important to hire someone who's likely to be happy in the job for which you're hiring. A question like this one will help uncover what makes each candidate happy at work — which is a great way to gauge whether they'd enjoy their role and stay at the company for a long time.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>There's no right answer to this question — it's more of a learning opportunity for you to see what your employees most enjoy in the industry. Nonetheless, a candidate's answer to this question should align with the core responsibilities of the job for which they're applying.</p> \n<p>A sales candidate who says they could lead client kickoff meetings every day, for example, is a much better fit than a sales candidate who prefers to create lead-generating campaigns (a task that shows a bigger interest in the marketing side of things).</p> \n<h4>13. \"If you had $40,000 to build your own business, what would you do?\"</h4> \n<p>This question is a favorite of HubSpot Marketing Team Development Manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekueffner\">Emily MacIntyre</a>. First, the type of business they choose to talk about can reveal a lot about their interests, values, and how creative they are. Second, it'll give you insight into how business-savvy they are. By giving them a specific amount to work with (in this case, $40,000), they have the opportunity to parse out how they'd spend that money.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>The best answers to this question will get specific: They'll offer an overview of the business <em>and </em>get into the logistics of where that money would go, whom they'd hire first, and so on.</p> \n<h3>Questions to Test a Candidate's Knowledge or Interest in Your Specific Company</h3> \n<h4>14. \"Pitch our company to me as if I were buying our product/service.\"</h4> \n<p>This is a unique and more challenging approach to the generic \"What does our company do?\" question. It forces candidates to not only drum up the research they've done to prepare for the interview, but also show they can use this research to craft a persuasive message that would be valuable in a business situation.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>This will come more naturally to some candidates than others. Above all, good answers to this interview question are able to combine an accurate definition of your company with what it offers to your core customer that they need or can't get anywhere else.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that someone interviewing for a sales or marketing position might find it easier than someone interviewing for a non-client facing role — and that's okay. You aren't necessarily assessing their delivery. But it'll be interesting to see how each candidate thinks through and gives their response.</p> \n<h4>15. \"What has surprised you about this interview process so far?\"</h4> \n<p>This is a question no candidate can really prepare for, and it'll give you some indication of how candidates are feeling about the whole thing. Plus, you can see how they think on their feet.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>You're looking for specifics here — something about the office space; the personality of the team; an assignment they were given to complete.</p> \n<p>Honest answers are good answers, and answers that are directed at <em>you</em> are even better, as they show the candidate is confident speaking their mind in front of decision-makers. For instance, maybe the candidate was surprised you asked them about something on their resume that they don't personally pay much attention to.</p> \n<h4>16. \"Do you have any questions for me?\"</h4> \n<p>This is another classic interview question, and like the one above, you're seeing how candidates think on their feet. The answer to this question also reveals what's important to the candidate. Are they wondering about company culture, or compensation? Are they curious about growth potential, or learning opportunities?</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>There are no right or wrong answers, but personality and communication style are important factors when considering hiring someone to join your team, and you can get a sense of these factors with their answer.</p> \n<p><em><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b15f5ee5-9381-4b6d-b503-a5f8997d6eff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"marketing questions\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b15f5ee5-9381-4b6d-b503-a5f8997d6eff.png\"></a></em></p> \n<p><em></em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgreat-interview-questions&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9cd76457-ee12-40f6-b9d3-53674b1f7714.png","linkMd5":"6387f16bdee8fb38e290119420a2e2f8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-05-651_5f40cc83585676b8.webp","destWidth":604,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6896,"destBytes":9546,"author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich Cox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9cd76457-ee12-40f6-b9d3-53674b1f7714.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-05-651_5f40cc83585676b8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/best%20interview%20questions-1.png?width=1080&name=best%20interview%20questions-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-10-950_23c2f1b0f7b8a396.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b15f5ee5-9381-4b6d-b503-a5f8997d6eff.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn75@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-10-063_90aed6fd7d43f179.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgreat-interview-questions&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn71@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-10-565_a4548ece2e4ad5d2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705083},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"How 500 Marketers are Leveraging Instagram Shopping Tools [Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-shopping-data","description":"<p>Does anyone remember the days when all we saw on Instagram were poorly lit pictures our friends took and memes we didn’t want our parents to see on Facebook? Well, we’re long gone from then.</p> \n<p>The platform has evolved from a simple image-sharing social platform to a money-making content curation one. With the addition of Instagram’s shopping tools, it’s steering more toward ecommerce and less on the social aspect.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Data: Instagram Engagement Report [2022 Version]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png\"></a></p> \n<p>So what does that mean for brands? We surveyed over 500 marketers to learn more about their Instagram strategy. Find out below what we found out as it relates to the social platform’s shopping tools.</p> \n<h2>The Benefits and Challenges of Instagram’s Shopping Tools</h2> \n<p>When we asked marketers the biggest benefit of using Instagram’s shopping tools, their number one answer was the increased product discoverability.</p> \n<p>In the past, users had to navigate to a brand’s website to get product or service details. Today, they can learn everything they need to know about it. In addition, Instagram’s \"wishlist\" feature also allows users to save products they like to a specific folder on the app.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"lucid poll asking &quot;do consumers shop on social media?&quot; Results show that 24.5% say they have shopped on instagram. \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D.png?width=500&amp;name=How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"lucid poll asking &quot;do consumers shop on social media?&quot; Results show that 24.5% say they have shopped on instagram. \" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/do-consumers-shop-directly-on-social-media-platforms\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The second biggest benefit is the simplified shopping experience. Gone are the days when you need to leave the app to make the purchase. You can discover a brand and make a purchase all in the same breath. This means a more enjoyable process for consumers, which can lead to more purchases for brands.</p> \n<p>Another key advantage Instagram’s shopping tools offer is the ability to easily partner with influencers.</p> \n<p>Currently, creators can tag easily the products they’re promoting and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/do-consumers-shop-directly-on-social-media-platforms?_ga=2.29777660.2134660075.1645397012-1770650723.1645397012\">send traffic directly to the brand’s Shop page</a>.</p> \n<p>In addition, Instagram is <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/creators/earn-money/affiliate\">currently testing an affiliate program</a>, in which influencers have their own Shop page.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"instagram affiliate program for influencers\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D-2.jpeg?width=500&amp;name=How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"\" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p>This allows users to easily find products recommended by their favorite influencers and make a purchase seamlessly.</p> \n<p>Now, onto the not-so-great obstacles of Instagram’s shopping tools.</p> \n<p>The biggest thing marketers surveyed complained about is supply-chain issues following many purchases. Since the pandemic, this has been a common hurdle for many businesses, as manufacturers deal with month- or year-long backlogs.</p> \n<p>Another concern marketers are facing is not generating enough revenue from utilizing <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-shopping-tools\">Instagram’s shopping tools</a> or having access to certain features.</p> \n<p>37% of marketers also complained about <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412\">Instagram’s selling fees</a>, which is currently 5% per shipment, or a flat fee of $0.40 for shipments of $8.00 or less. For brands, this is an additional cost that they could avoid by directing traffic to their website instead.</p> \n<p>Another big concern is the loss of user data. When Instagram serves as the end-to-end platform, brands can lose valuable data to inform future strategies.</p> \n<p>Now that you know the pros and cons of the shopping tools, let’s break down how marketers are using them.</p> \n<h2>How Marketers Leverage Instagram Shopping Tools</h2> \n<p>From the marketers we surveyed in our HubSpot Blog Research, 32% currently leverage Instagram Shops in their marketing strategy, and 48% plan to increase their investment in 2022.</p> \n<p>While some brands tried the shopping tools as soon as it was introduced, others are just now diving in. In fact, 36% of marketers will be increasing their investment in Instagram Shops <em>for the first time</em> this year.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, 14% of marketers will be prioritizing Instagram Shops above all other features in 2022.</p> \n<p>However, one thing to note is that when compared to all the features available on Instagram, marketers say its shopping tools don’t offer a high ROI when it comes to leads. Posting content and going live offer much better results.</p> \n<p>With that said, while it may not be ideal for driving leads, it may work well for meeting other marketing goals.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"instagram shopping tools\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D.jpeg?width=500&amp;name=How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"\" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p>Out of all shopping features available on Instagram (Shop tab, product tagging, guides, Live shopping), the Shop tab is the most used tool by 47% of marketers surveyed.</p> \n<p>However, in terms of ROI, it’s in the #2 spot. What’s on top? Instagram Shopping from Creators, which allows influencers to tag the products they’re using in an image or video.</p> \n<p>As for shopping tools by format: It looks like in-feed shopping, Stories shopping, and Guides shopping are used at the same rate by over one in three marketers.</p> \n<h2>How Marketers Approach Product Launches on Instagram</h2> \n<p>One of the most interesting findings from our research is that for many brands, Instagram’s shopping tools are their sole ecommerce platform.</p> \n<p>In fact, 41% of marketers surveyed said most of the brands they work with use the platform’s shopping tools exclusively. The other 59% say their brands have a presence outside of the social platform via an ecommerce website.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"instagram in-feed shoppable post\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D-1.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p>So the question is, how do Instagram’s shopping tools impact a product launch? One in four marketers says it’s much better to launch a product exclusively on the platform.</p> \n<p>In fact, 83% of marketers surveyed say they have worked with a brand that launched a product exclusively on the platform.</p> \n<p>Conversely, 15% say launching a product/service exclusively on Instagram is worse than launching elsewhere.</p> \n<p>We’ve covered <em>a lot</em> here. One fact that’s clear is that more marketers will invest in Instagram’s shopping tools than they have in the past. What works well for one brand may not work for another, based on the audience, the audience, and more.</p> \n<p>So, don’t be afraid to experiment with all the features and analyze your data to figure out what offers the best return on investment for your company.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Improve your website with effective technical SEO.

It all boils down to making yourself available to support and advise someone when they need it, delivering that support in a way that makes sense to them, and always keeping that person's best interests in mind.</p> \n<p>So, what value does a mentor bring? It depends on who you ask.</p> \n<p>For <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vrnda-levalley\">Vrnda LeValley,</a> customer training manager at HubSpot, it’s a shift in perspective.</p> \n<p>\"My mentor provides a perspective that isn’t riddled with the same self-doubt and stereotype sensitivities that I desperately want to avoid and handicap me,\" she says, \"and a broader view of the implications of action versus inaction because they have a better vantage point from their upstream position within the company.\"</p> \n<p>She adds that her mentor has been able to step in and correct narratives that muddy her ability to make the most strategic decisions.</p> \n<p>For Legal Specialist at HubSpot <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronjay77\">Jason Perry,</a> one of the benefits of mentorship is the opportunity to extend your network.</p> \n<p>\"I most value the trust and confidence they extend to me by granting me access and recommending me to their broader networks,\" he said.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, there’s a certain freedom that comes with having a mentor.</p> \n<p>\"I think it allows for an open space to be vulnerable with someone who is more senior in their career but does not have direct control over your career growth,\" said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloewashington\">Chloe Washington</a>, chief of staff to the CMO at HubSpot. \"You can be more transparent and ask questions you may not feel comfortable asking your manager or another co-worker.\"</p> \n<p>With that said, the mentorship doesn’t just benefit the mentee, it’s a two-sided relationship.</p> \n<p>\"I am constantly inspired by what my mentees are doing, their ambition, and their goals,\" Washington said. \"It motivates me as I continue along my career journey. It also allows me to form relationships with people that I may have not otherwise been able to speak with as much or as often.\"</p> \n<div>\n <iframe style=\"border: none; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://listen.hubspot.com/embed/v2/smallPlayer/f0d5558d\" width=\"600\" height=\"337.5\"></iframe>  \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Understand what you want out of the relationship.</h3> \n<p>As we’ve mentioned, mentorship isn’t a one-way relationship. This means that just like the mentee, you should know the type of relationship you’re seeking and what you want to gain.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlene-strain-813a5a104\">Charlene Strain</a>, marketing manager at HubSpot, serves as a mentor and suggests asking yourself these questions to get started:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you view it as a two-way street, player-coach relationship where you learn from them as much as they learn from you or something else?</li> \n <li>How can you sharpen your area of expertise?</li> \n <li>Do they have connections or gaps of knowledge for you as well?</li> \n <li>How does taking on a mentorship role strengthen you as a leader in your personal and professional life?</li> \n</ul> Knowing these answers will help you frame your mentorship strategy and start with clear intentions.\n<br> \n<h3>2. Set expectations together in the very beginning.</h3> \n<p>Once you know what you want out of the relationship as a mentor, setting expectations is the next natural step.</p> \n<p>Every mentor-mentee relationship is unique. So, when you first start out, discuss expectations with your mentee and determine if you’re ready for that commitment.</p> \n<p>\"Everyone works and receives feedback differently, so it's important to understand if the relationship is a fit for both parties [based] on what they're looking for,\" said Strain.</p> \n<p>Here’s what Strain recommends discussing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Is there a time limit on when the mentorship ends?</li> \n <li>How often should you meet, and why?</li> \n <li>What resources can the mentor provide for the mentee to do some work on their own?</li> \n <li>What metrics are being used to measure success?</li> \n <li>How hands-on should the mentor be?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You should come to these answers as a duo and it’s OK if it takes a little bit to figure it out. The time you put in at the beginning will pay off in the long term.</p> \n<p>Some expectations are pretty straightforward, Perry says: professionalism, punctuality, clear communication, and organization. However, some expectations will be shaped by the mentee.</p> \n<p>\"A mentee should be able to tell me as the mentor exactly what they'd like me to do for them, whether it 's to provide information, make an introduction, write a recommendation or provide advice,\" says Perry. \"The relationship is theirs to shape and build and that starts with a clear, direct ask of some sort.\"</p> \n<p>When Washington works with mentees, her first session focuses on goal setting, setting up a meeting cadence, and discussing ground rules.</p> \n<p>\"For example, if there is a big topic to discuss, I request that they give me a heads up a few days before so that I can come fully prepared to discuss my point of view and not waste their time formulating my thoughts on the fly,\" she said.</p> \n<p>From there, she creates a running agenda doc to keep track of notes and have a place they can refer back to once the mentorship ends.</p> \n<h3>3. Take a genuine interest in your mentee as a person.</h3> \n<p>A mentor/mentee relationship is a very personal one.</p> \n<p>You can give mediocre advice without really knowing a person, but to stand out as an amazing mentor, you're really going to have to get to know your mentee on a personal level.</p> \n<p>You probably have some of the more career-oriented questions down: what their working style is, their dream job, goals for their current job, and so on and so forth. But what about the stuff that makes them ... <em>them? </em></p> \n<p>Getting to know your mentee on a deeper level will help you build a strong relationship, and it'll also help you understand who they are as a person and how they interact with others, and so on.</p> \n<p>One great way to get to know someone?<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/active-listening-guide\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/active-listening-guide\">Become an active listener</a>. This is easier said than done: It means making a conscious effort to really, truly pay attention to what your mentee is saying, instead of thinking about what you're going to say next.</p> \n<p>\"Two<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/mentor-traits\"> traits that are helpful for someone to be a successful mentor</a> are good listening skills and the ability to connect like-minded people,\" said Strain. \"Our professional lives are not in a silo, they're a web. So, anyway I can truly listen to a mentee's goals, their journey, and where they see themselves will help me connect them with other people or businesses with the same mission.\"</p> \n<p>You might worry that you need to come up with something helpful right away, when in fact, the best thing you can do for your mentee is to listen closely to what they're saying, ask open questions to dig deeper and act as a sounding board.</p> \n<h3>4. Build trust.</h3> \n<p>In the last section, we stressed the vulnerability that comes with mentorship. To continue fostering a safe environment in which your mentee can share their concerns and challenges, you need to build trust.</p> \n<p>That can happen in a few different ways. For Solutions Engineer at HubSpot<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagaille\"> Jeremy Sagaille</a>, it’s transparency.</p> \n<p>\"I feel like I can really be myself in front of my mentor and I don't feel like I have to do the typical corporate political BS,\" he said, \"which is something that I've definitely had to tiptoe through in the past and haven't done well with.\"</p> \n<p>For LeValley, it’s the ability to see beyond the circumstance to assess the core issues, challenges, and opportunities.</p> \n<p>\"Those can get cloudy when you are on the road to a destination you have never visited before,\" she says. \"It makes all the difference when avoiding pitfalls and finding solid shortcuts.\"</p> \n<p>She adds that truth-telling is another valuable trait in a mentor.</p> \n<p>\"Many people haven’t been given the hard messages required for growth, due to lack of investment or lack of courage from those around them,\" she says. \"Personally, the best thing my mentor told me was to check in with my growth mindset and read a book. Not what I wanted to hear but it was 100% what I needed to hear.\"</p> \n<p>Once you build trust with your mentee, your relationship will be able to go that much deeper.</p> \n<h3>5. Know when to give advice.</h3> \n<p>When you're mentoring someone, you might feel pressured to give them advice straight away. But not all feedback is helpful feedback, and knowing the difference is key.</p> \n<p>A good mentor knows when to hit 'pause' during a conversation, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccacorliss\">Rebecca Corliss</a>, former director of marketing at HubSpot.</p> \n<p>\"If you don't have the right information, experience, or emotional state to react to a scenario properly, hit 'pause,\" she said. \"That will give you a chance to get more information, talk to your resources, and come back with a clear and valuable response.\"</p> \n<p>Here’s what that might look like in a real conversation.</p> \n<p><em>\"Thanks for sharing this with me. I'm going to take some time and give this some serious thought before we continue. It's important to me that I'm giving you the best possible solution. Why don't we continue talking about it [tomorrow/next week/next time we meet]? I'll book some time.\"</em></p> \n<h3>6. Don’t assume anything about your mentee – ask.</h3> \n<p>Biases cloud our judgment whether we realize it or not. While we can work to uncover and dismantle them, some are so ingrained that they peak out without us realizing it.</p> \n<p>To combat this issue with your mentee, breakthrough common assumptions by asking questions and digging deeper. This is especially important if you're mentoring someone who's in the early stages of their career</p> \n<p>Say you're mentoring someone who's having trouble getting through to their manager. Instead of launching into a story about a time you had communication issues with a manager of yours, spend time asking questions that draw out the important details of their problem.</p> \n<p>\"Your job is to facilitate advancement and movement, not just chat,\" says LeValley. \"Your words can change their lives so you must choose them carefully.\"</p> \n<p>Only once you've gotten an honest background on a problem can you share helpful, relevant feedback – without making decisions <em>for</em> your mentee.</p> \n<h3>7. Share your journey.</h3> \n<p>Being open to sharing your own mistakes and failures is one of the best gifts a mentor can give.</p> \n<p>Not only is it helpful information for problem-solving purposes, but it also builds trust and strengthens the relationship.</p> \n<p>\"Junior employees don't always feel comfortable owning up to a mistake or admitting that they're struggling in a certain area,\" says former Managing Director at HubSpot<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmajsnider\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmajsnider\">Emma Brudner</a>. \"If you cop to your failures and struggles, you make it OK for them to chime in and help them share with you.\"</p> \n<p>Sagaille says that before his mentor, he often thought the struggles he faced were unique. However, he was reassured by his mentor, who had experience in his exact role.</p> \n<p>\"I'm just excited that I have a window into the future a little bit because she's dealt with similar issues and she's had some setbacks because of those issues,\" he says, \"so, she's able to steer me in the direction so I can avoid those pitfalls.\"</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lesliezye\">Leslie Ye</a>, content designer at HubSpot, suggests reflecting on the roadblocks you faced when you were in your mentee’s stage in life or career.</p> \n<p>\"Hearing how someone else approached a challenge is always helpful for someone going through it for the first time,\" she says. \"Even if you don't solve problems the same way as your mentee, it's always useful to hear multiple perspectives.\"</p> \n<p>Perry echoes this sentiment.</p> \n<p>\"Take time to tap into your own story,\" he says, \"Especially for Black mentors, it's important to relate and establish an interpersonal bond that fosters real talk – be a true resource in all facets.\"</p> \n<p>He adds that adversity of any kind our response to them is a foundational way to create relatability. Strain agrees, pointing to her non-traditional tech background before transitioning to the B2B Saas space.</p> \n<p>\"I'm extremely transparent about my own journey with a mentee. As I climb up the ladder as a Black woman in tech, it's important for me to continue reaching back down and helping others up as well,\" she says. \"If it wasn't for some of my own incredible mentors throughout my career, I wouldn't be a mentor now as well.\"</p> \n<h3>8. Celebrate their achievements.</h3> \n<p>Because people often look for or call upon a mentor to help them with tough situations, many mentorship conversations revolve around the stressful stuff.</p> \n<p>When you take the time to highlight and even celebrate your mentee's successes and achievements, you're also building your mentee's confidence and keeping them motivated.</p> \n<p>\"I've worked in a lot of places in the past that were very reserved with positive feedback and very lavish with constructive or negative feedback,\" said Sagaille. \"So I think that's something my mentor does really, really well – it's a nice balance.\"</p> \n<p>Some mentees also seek approval from their mentors. Acknowledging their success is a way to satisfy that psychological need for recognition.</p> \n<p>If you’re wondering <em>how </em>to celebrate their achievements, consider asking them what their love languages are. Those aren’t just helpful for personal relationships, they also work for professional ones as well.</p> \n<p>For instance, you may want to congratulate your mentee on a win by sending them a gift. However, if they value words of affirmation more, that’s the better way to go.</p> \n<h3>9. Seek out resources to help your mentee grow.</h3> \n<p>Great mentors look for situations – and some even create situations – to help their mentees get closer to their goals.</p> \n<p>It can be anything from connecting them with someone with experience in their dream job to recommending a conference they might be interested in. Take note of the areas in which your mentee wants to grow, and always be looking for opportunities to point them in the right direction.</p> \n<p>If you work at the same company as your mentee and have some involvement in their experience, Corliss suggests introducing new projects to them over time as a way to build a strong foundation.</p> \n<p>\"First, start with something that gives context. This could be something that requires research and is genuinely valuable,\" she says. \"Then, handoff something small that you normally do for your intern or mentee to own. This will help your mentee learn how to develop ownership over something, including how to execute and reach a goal on his or her own. Then, build upon that foundation.\"</p> \n<h3>10. Be sure you have the bandwidth.</h3> \n<p>LeValley believes mentorship is best when it’s approached as a calling instead of a task. With that in mind, it’s important to consider if you have the bandwidth to take it on.</p> \n<p>\"Be honest with yourself about what extent you are willing to give of your time and expertise,\" Strain says. \"This will help you manage your own workload and personal life easier without guilt or stretching yourself too thin.\"</p> \n<p>Washington echoes this sentiment and adds that it’s OK to bow out if you realize you don’t have the bandwidth.</p> \n<p>\"The relationship needs to be mutually beneficial and if you feel like you would be burdened by taking on the relationship, then be respectful to your prospective mentee and tell them that you’re not able to take on the relationship,\" she says. \"It’s better to be upfront than to waste anyone’s time.\"</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, being a great mentor takes practice and patience. The more you work with a given mentee, the more you'll learn a lot about them: their communication style, how they process feedback, how they go about pursuing their goals.</p> \n<p>The best part? It will likely be as rewarding an experience for you as it will be for your mentees.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in Jan. 2016 and has been updated for comprehensiveness. </em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmentor-tips-positive-impact&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png","linkMd5":"8062f5ce2ddfcb1333f21fa686de0223","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn72@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-691_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","destWidth":660,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7430,"destBytes":10618,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn72@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-691_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn2@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-10-491_5d7cf3090735f322.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmentor-tips-positive-impact&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-09-934_739f35be8e732354.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705066},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"23 Simple Email Marketing Tips to Improve Your Open and Clickthrough Rates [+HubSpot Blog Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/make-emails-more-clickable-list","description":"<p>Practicing good inbound marketing means sending emails to people who actually <em>want</em> to hear from you.</p> \n<p>But oftentimes, your emails still end up getting lost in your customers' inbox clutter -- or worse, their spam folder.

Do not buy email addresses.</h3> \n<p>I know what you're thinking: In the early stages of an <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">email marketing</a> newsletter, you want to do whatever it takes to kickstart the campaign and get eyeballs on your business. I get it. Whatever options you see online, however, you should resist the urge to <em>purchase</em> an email list.</p> \n<p>There are lots of ways to buy an email list, but none of them will actually benefit your campaign. Why? Since the owners of these email addresses didn't explicitly agree to receive content from you, there's no telling how interested they are -- or if they're even a fit for what you have to offer. A bought email list is also in violation of GDPR (we'll talk more about this in just a minute).</p> \n<p>Purchasing email lists is always a bad idea. Get more reasons why in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/why-purchasing-email-lists-is-always-a-bad-idea.aspx\">this blog post</a>.</p> \n<h3>2. Abide by CAN-SPAM rules.</h3> \n<p>CAN-SPAM (<strong>C</strong>ontrolling the <strong>A</strong>ssault of <strong>N</strong>on-<strong>S</strong>olicited <strong>P</strong>ornography <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>M</strong>arketing) is an act <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-can-spam-ht\">that was passed in 2003</a>. Essentially, it's a law that establishes the rules for commercial email and commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have a business stop emailing them, and outlines the penalties incurred for those who violate the law.</p> \n<p>In order to be CAN-SPAM compliant, it's important that your email messages follow these rules, which are <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\">available on the FTC's website</a>.</p> \n<p>A few highlights:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Include your valid physical postal address in every email you send out.</li> \n <li>Give recipients a clear and obvious way to opt out (i.e., unsubscribe) of every email you send. (<strong>HubSpot customers: </strong>Don't worry -- you can't save an email template unless it includes this element.)</li> \n <li>Use clear \"From,\" \"To,\" and \"Reply to\" language that accurately reflects who you are.</li> \n <li>Avoid \"no-reply\" or similar sender names, which prevent recipients from opting out of an email newsletter if they'd like to.</li> \n <li>Avoid selling or transferring any email addresses to another list.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong><em> Because I am not a lawyer, please do not construe the contents of this article as official legal advice. <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\">Check out the FTC's website</a> for extensive advice on this subject, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30594/A-Marketer-s-Guide-to-Getting-Past-Email-Spam-Filters.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">read this blog post</a> for more tips on improving email deliverability.</em></p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cm6Dnaqiyso\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</div> \n<h3>3. Ensure your opt-in process complies with GDPR.</h3> \n<p>You've probably heard of the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/data-privacy/gdpr\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, a new law enacted across Europe in May 2018 to better protect internet users' personal data.</p> \n<p>We don't expect you to have this long piece of legislation memorized. However, if some of your email recipients live in Europe, there is one key guideline by which you should develop your email marketing campaigns:</p> \n<p>When your website users land on a page that solicits their personal information, tradition might tell you to include a pre-checked box that opts the user into an email campaign so they can receive updates and special offers related to your business. Today, having this box pre-checked is in violation of GDPR. <strong>So, to comply with GDPR, make sure your European users and customers are given the clear option to opt into your email newsletter themselves -- don't make the decision for them</strong>.</p> \n<p>This rule might sound like bad news for your email marketing campaign, but it can actually improve your open and clickthrough rates. Limiting your subscriber list to just those who specifically asked to join you will ensure only the most interested people are receiving your messages. This maximizes the chances that you'll convert readers to qualified leads as a result of an email send.</p> \n<h3>4. Email new contacts within 24 hours.</h3> \n<p>It's important to take advantage of the window of opportunity when your company or brand is at the top of your prospects' minds. You can really get a pulse of what future engagement will look like by what people do when you email then within 24 hours of their subscribing to your newsletter, signing up for an offer, and so on. Plus, it's a great opportunity for branding and setting expectations.</p> \n<p>If you don't have any automated email workflows set up, you're likely missing out on some major opportunities to nurture and engage your existing contacts.</p> \n<p>(<strong>HubSpot customers: </strong><a title=\"HubSpot's Workflows tool\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing-automation\">Use HubSpot's Workflows App</a> to create personalized, automated email workflows that can get triggered in a number of different ways: when a contact gets added to a list, submits a form on your website, clicks a link in an email, views a page on your blog, clicks on one of your AdWords ads, or becomes a marketing qualified lead.)</p> \n<h3>5. Send your emails from a real person, not your company.</h3> \n<p>When you send email from a real person, your email open rate increases. Plain and simple. This is because -- based on past tests we've conducted -- recipients are typically more likely to trust a personalized sender name and email address than a generic one. People are so inundated with spam nowadays, they often hesitate to open email from unfamiliar senders -- and they're more likely to trust a personalized sender name and email address than a generic one.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31634/A-B-Testing-in-Action-3-Real-Life-Marketing-Experiments.aspx\" title=\"we've found\">we found that </a>that emails sent from \"Maggie Georgieva, HubSpot\" perform better in terms of open <em>and </em>clickthrough rate than emails sent from just \"HubSpot.\" So, it may be best to do this ...</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sender name: Paul Smith</li> \n <li>Sender email address: <a href=\"mailto:psmith@company.com\">psmith@company.com</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>... instead of this:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sender name: Marketing Team</li> \n <li>Sender email address: <a href=\"mailto:marketing@company.com\">marketing@company.com</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>(<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/how-do-i-personalize-the-from-name-and-address-in-an-email?_ga=1.205947027.1866822358.1456501228\">Click here</a> to learn how to personalize the \"From\" name and email address.)</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Our tests showed personalization works, but we've also found that a combination of a person's name and a company name together in the sender name works well, too. You've just got to <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/an-introduction-to-ab-testing\">A/B test what works best</a> for your particular company, brand, and industry as well as what's ideal based on to whom you're sending emails.</p> \n<h3>6. Pre-set the preview text.</h3> \n<p>Email clients like the iPhone Mail app, Gmail, and Outlook will display the first few lines of text from the body of your email alongside the subject line. In other words, it's a text preview of the content inside the email. The exact amount of text shown depends on the email client and user settings.</p> \n<p>Use it to provide a short, to-the-point synopsis of what you're offering -- and keep it to 50 characters or less.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-preview-text-in-inbox.png?width=690&amp;height=54&amp;name=email-preview-text-in-inbox.png\" alt=\"email-preview-text-in-inbox.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"54\" /></p> \n<p>When you don't set the preview text, the client will automatically pull from the body of your email, which not only looks messy, but is also a wasted opportunity to engage your audience.

Write clear and clickable subject lines.</h3> \n<p>Speaking of the subject line ... your marketing emails have a lot to compete with in recipients' inboxes. The best way to stand out is to write compelling, \"can't-help-but-click-on-this\" subject lines.</p> \n<p>To entice readers to click, be sure your subject lines:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Are super clear and understandable.</li> \n <li>Are fewer than 50 characters so they don't get cut off, particularly by mobile devices.</li> \n <li>Use language and messaging that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">your target buyer persona</a> is familiar with and excited about.</li> \n <li>Include verbs and action-oriented language to create a sense of urgency and excitement.</li> \n <li>Include an exclusive value proposition (like 20% off an item or a free ebook) so people know what they're getting.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30594/A-Marketer-s-Guide-to-Getting-Past-Email-Spam-Filters.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">Avoid spam triggers</a> like “Cash,” “Quote,” and “Save.\"</li> \n <li>Are timely, if applicable. (One of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-subject-lines-list\">my favorite subject lines</a> came from Warby Parker and read: \"Uh-oh, your prescription is expiring\".)</li> \n <li>Include their first names sometimes (it could <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/the-science-of-email-marketing\">increase clickthrough rates</a>), or even add something about their specific location. (You'll want to do this sparingly, like for your most important offers, rather than over-doing it and being repetitive or intrusive.)</li> \n</ul> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-email-subject-line\">Read this blog post</a> for more tips on writing clickable, delightful subject lines.</p> \n<h3>8. Keep your emails concise.</h3> \n<p>Everyone's busy and their inbox is already full. Why add to the problem with a longwinded email? People generally like short, concise emails better than long ones because concise emails have an obvious focus. Plus, when your users are scanning through all their emails in a short amount of time, they're more likely to find the overall message before deciding to take any action.</p> \n<p>Another reason to keep your emails short? Too much copy is actually a red flag for spam filters, too.</p> \n<p>To keep your emails short and compelling, write your email like you were talking to someone in real life. If your email <em>has </em>to be on the long side, break it up into multiple paragraphs to provide visual breaks. This'll make skimming it much easier on your reader. (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/The-9-Must-Have-Components-of-Compelling-Email-Copy.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">Read this blog post on how to write compelling emails</a> for more tips.)</p> \n<p>Here's a great example of a concise email:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-lattes-concise-email-language.png?width=647&amp;height=886&amp;name=free-lattes-concise-email-language.png\" alt=\"free-lattes-concise-email-language.png\" width=\"647\" height=\"886\" /></p> \n<h3>9. Include one call-to-action button per email.</h3> \n<p>Remember when I said a lot of your email recipients will scan your email without reading all the copy? That's why you want to have a clear call-to-action (CTA) button that's easy to spot for even the quickest of email scanners. Without a CTA button, you won't be calling on your recipients to take any action that actually benefits them -- and the growth of your business.</p> \n<p>You'll want to place your CTA in a location where it's easily visible and where it makes sense for someone to click on it. For example, you might put a CTA to download a free ebook in an email that describes new strategies for using your product.</p> \n<p>Once you've determined where you want to put your CTA, it's time to create the button itself. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-templates-free-download-ht\">Click here to download 50 free CTA button templates</a> to get you started. (<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> Learn how to add CTA buttons to emails in HubSpot <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cta-user-guide-v2/how-to-add-a-call-to-action-cta-to-an-email\">here</a>.)</p> \n<h3>10. Add alt text to your CTA image.</h3> \n<p>Many email clients block images -- including your CTA buttons -- by default. That means a good chunk of your audience may not see your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-optimization-ht\">beautiful, optimized CTA</a>. Instead, they see this:</p> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388144872-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_10.02.52_AM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \n<p>When you set an image's alt text, though, you let recipients who can't view images in their email know exactly where to click to complete the action:</p> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"This is what an image with alt-text looks like.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-385628288-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_9.58.55_AM.png\" alt=\"CTA image with alt-text in an email.\" /></p> \n<p>You can either edit the alt text in your email tool's rich text editor (just right-click the image and edit away), or you can manually enter it in the HTML editor of your email tool like this:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'courier new', courier;\"><em>&lt;a href=\"<strong>HTTP://YOURLINKHERE.COM</strong>\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"<strong>YOUR CTA BUTTON IMAGE SOURCE HERE.JPG</strong>\" alt-text=\"<strong>YOUR ALT-TEXT GOES HERE</strong>\"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</em></span></p> \n<h3>11. Hyperlink your emails' images.</h3> \n<p>Your ultimate goal in email marketing is to get people to click through to a web page. One way to increase the clickthrough rate without littering the copy with links is to hyperlink the images in your email to the webpage that corresponds with the content of the image.</p> \n<p>If you're inviting readers to download an ebook, for example, and you have a picture of the ebook included in the email, don't just hyperlink the text next to the image telling people to \"download it here.\" Hyperlink the ebook's picture, too. People are drawn to images much more commonly than text, and you want to give your email subscribers as many options to get your ebook as you can.</p> \n<p>You can simply click on the image and then use your email tool's \"Insert/Edit Link\" option, or you can link an image in the HTML editor using the following code:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: 16px;\"><em>&lt;a href=\"<strong>HTTP://YOURLINKHERE.COM</strong>\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"<strong>YOUR IMAGE SOURCE HERE.JPG</strong>\"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</em></span></p> \n<h3>12. Include noticeable text links.</h3> \n<p>In general, it's a good idea to link to your featured offer in multiple places in addition to the clear and focused call-to-action button. In addition to your main CTAs and images, consider including a noticeable text link (or two) when applicable, as having more links increases the opportunity for engagement.</p> \n<h3>13. Place at least one clickable item above the fold.</h3> \n<p>One way to make your emails more clickable? Place one or more of your clickable elements -- whether it's a CTA button, a text link, or a clickable image -- near the beginning of your email.</p> \n<p>This is especially useful for mobile users. Mobile tends to require a lot of scrolling, and sometimes squinting, pinching, and zooming. Giving a recipient something actionable that is seen upon opening can lead to more clicks in this environment.</p> \n<h3>14. Add alt text to all of your images.</h3> \n<p>Again, a lot of email clients out there block images by default. (<a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/dev-resources/will-it-work/image-blocking/\">Here's the full list</a> from Campaign Monitor.) In those cases, images won't load unless the recipient clicks a button to show them or change their default settings.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-add-alt-text-to-email-images-ht\">Adding alt text to your email images</a> helps recipients understand your message -- even if they can't see the images right away. (<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/cos-pages-editor/how-do-i-add-alt-text-to-my-image\">Click here</a> to learn how to add alt text to your email images in HubSpot.)</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add-alt-text.png?width=690&amp;height=301&amp;name=add-alt-text.png\" alt=\"add-alt-text.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"301\" /></p> \n<p>You might consider making the language in your alt text actionable, such as \"Click here to download the ultimate content creation kit.\" Actionable alt text will essentially turn every linked image into another CTA. So, even if someone doesn't see the snazzy GIF of my latest offer (or if they hover their mouse over an image that <em>does </em>show up), the alt text will beckon them to click.</p> \n<h3>15. Avoid background images.</h3> \n<p>This is especially important if your target buyers tend to use Outlook as an email client.</p> \n<p>Microsoft Outlook doesn't recognize background images, period. Given that <a href=\"https://emailclientmarketshare.com/\">Outlook is the fifth most-used email client</a> with 7% of the market share -- and that's in total; your industry might have a lot more -- it's best to avoid using background images altogether.</p> \n<p>Instead, use a background color and use images in other ways in your email, like Harry's did in their email below:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/harrys-email-example.png?width=580&amp;height=1630&amp;name=harrys-email-example.png\" alt=\"harrys-email-example.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"1630\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"http://beautiful-email-newsletters.com/emails/harrys-our-most-popular-gift-is/\">Beautiful Email Newsletters</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>16. Add social sharing buttons.</h3> \n<p>Increasing the number of people who see your link will increase the number of people who click on it. So, be sure to extend the life of your email by <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx\">adding social sharing buttons</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Social Sharing Buttons\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388230117-png/linkedin-share-button-above.png?width=300&amp;name=linkedin-share-button-above.png\" alt=\"Social Sharing Buttons\" width=\"300\" /></a></p> \n<p>Many email tools will come with templates that have built-in social sharing buttons that make it easy -- just fill in the destination URL and you're good to go. If you don't have built-in capabilities, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx\">here is a cheat sheet for easily creating your own social sharing buttons</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you want to increase clicks, you want to add <em>sharing</em> buttons, not <em>follow</em> buttons. The former will allow your email recipients to pass along the offer URL in your email to their followers. The latter will prompt them to Like, follow, or add your company social media channels.</p> \n<h3>17. Simplify sharing with ready-made tweets.</h3> \n<p>People are far more likely to take an action if you make it really, really easy for them. For recipients out there who are too lazy to tweet the wonderful content you sent them via email, you can make it easy for them by creating what we call a \"lazy tweet.\"</p> \n<p>One simple way to do this? Using ClickToTweet, a free custom tweet link generator. First, <a href=\"https://clicktotweet.com/basic\">go to ClickToTweet's basic tweet generator</a>. Then, type in your tweet, desired (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">trackable</a>) destination URL, and hashtags:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"click-to-tweet-example.png\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/click-to-tweet-example.png?width=669&amp;name=click-to-tweet-example.png\" alt=\"click-to-tweet-example.png\" width=\"669\"><br>Click \"Generate New Link,\" and then grab that link. Then you can link it to your Twitter sharing button. Or, if you're <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts-user-guide-v2/how-lists-help-you-segment-your-contacts\">segmenting your list by attributes</a> such as \"has Twitter\" or \"topic of recent conversion: social media\" (you'll need marketing intelligence software <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/email\">like HubSpot</a> for this), you can even include it in your main email copy, like this:</br></img></p> \n<h3><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Premade tweet copy example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388186477-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_10.28.40_AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_10.28.40_AM.png\" alt=\"Premade tweet copy example\" width=\"600\" /></h3> \n<h3>18. Add an email forwarding option.</h3> \n<p>Another way to extend the clicks on your email beyond its shelf life is to prompt your audience to forward the offer. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-people-forward-emails-data\">The folks at Litmus found that</a> <strong>the most forwarded emails were 13X more likely than the typical email to include “Share With Your Network” calls-to-action. </strong>By including forward-to-a-friend (or social sharing links, as we discussed above), you put it in recipients' minds to share.</p> \n<p>You can add a little post-script to the end of your email copy, such as \"Not responsible for your company's social media? Feel free to forward this ebook to a friend or colleague using social media marketing.\" Link the call-to-action to a pre-made email, complete with subject and body text. That way, all someone has to do is enter their associates' email addresses and hit \"Send.\"</p> \n<p>You can highlight text or an image and add the URL via your email tool's rich text editor and then enter a mailto:? link. Here's what this looks like:</p> \n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">mailto:?subject=Your%20subject%20here%20&amp;body=Your%20email%20body%20text%20here.</span></em></span> \n<p>You can also create this in your HTML editor. Here's how to attach a mailto:? link to text:</p> \n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">&lt;a href=\"mailto:?subject=<strong>Your%20subject%20here%20&amp;body=Your%20email%20body%20text%20here</strong>.\"&gt;</span></em></span> \n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">forward this ebook&lt;/a&gt;.</span></em></span> \n<p>And here's how to attach your mailto:? link to an image, such as a sleek call-to-action button that says \"Email This Offer\":</p> \n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">&lt;a href=\"mailto:?subject=<strong>Your%20subject%20here%20&amp;body=Your%20email%20body%20text%20here.</strong>\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"<strong>YOUR IMAGE SOURCE HERE.JPG</strong>\" alt-text=\"<strong>YOUR ALT-TEXT GOES HERE</strong>\"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span></em></span> \n<p>Just make sure you use the \"%20\" tag to separate words! Otherwise, your message willreadlikethis (not too appealing, right?).</p> \n<h3>19. Clean up the plain-text version of your emails.</h3> \n<p>Not every recipient is going to see the beautiful, HTML, rich-text version of your email. Some clients don't support HTML-rich emails, while other times, a person may simply choose to only view messages in plain text.</p> \n<p>When you don't optimize the plain-text version of your email, this is what happens when someone views it:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Plain-text email done wrong.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388686490-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-20_at_2.12.38_PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2013-11-20_at_2.12.38_PM.png\" alt=\"Plain-text email done wrong.\" width=\"403\" /></p> \n<p>Scary, isn't it? I don't think many people are going to bother to read through this garbled mess.</p> \n<p>So, cut out the extra text, replace long tracking URLs with shortened ones, and keep the body simple. Taking the five extra minutes to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32643/Why-Marketers-Must-Optimize-Emails-for-HTML-AND-Plain-Text-Infographic.aspx\">optimize your email's plain-text version</a> could help you reach more of your target segment and keep you out of the spam folder.</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you're cleaning up your plain-text emails, don't change the actual copy much at all or you'll risk it getting marked as spam.</p> \n<h3>20. Optimize your emails for mobile users.</h3> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://litmus.com/blog/mobile-rises-to-56-market-share-longest-sustained-growth-in-2016\">Litmus' analysis of over a billion email opens</a>, they reported that <strong>56% of opened emails were opened on mobile devices in April 2016. </strong>This figure represents an 8% increase in mobile opens in the past year.</p> \n<p>\"This represents a peak for mobile market share,\" they wrote, \"and the longest sustained growth we’ve seen after the holiday season.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mobile-email-opens-litmus.png?width=690&amp;height=420&amp;name=mobile-email-opens-litmus.png\" alt=\"mobile-email-opens-litmus.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"420\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"https://litmus.com/blog/mobile-rises-to-56-market-share-longest-sustained-growth-in-2016\">Litmus</a></em></span></p> <p>As more and more people use their mobile devices to read email and surf the web, it's more important than ever that marketers design their emails with mobile users in mind. Otherwise, their user base will be significantly affected.</p> <p>How? Here's a visual example of what happens when images aren't optimized for mobile (first) versus when images are optimized for mobile (second):</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-not-optimized-for-mobile.png?width=300&amp;name=email-not-optimized-for-mobile.png\" alt=\"email-not-optimized-for-mobile.png\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-optimized-for-mobile.png?width=300&amp;name=email-optimized-for-mobile.png\" alt=\"email-optimized-for-mobile.png\" width=\"300\" title=\"email-optimized-for-mobile.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 628px;\" /></img></p> <p>Isn't the second image a much better user experience?</p> <p>Here are a few ways to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-email-mobile-list\">optimize your emails for mobile devices</a>:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Reduce your images' file sizes</strong> to make up for mobile devices' generally slower download speeds. (HubSpot customers don't need to worry about it -- images uploaded to HubSpot's software are automatically compressed. Otherwise, tools like <a href=\"https://tinypng.com/\">TinyPNG</a> will help you reduce file size.)</li> \n  <li><strong>Ensure the CTA buttons and links are larger than 45-57 pixels </strong>for the best user experience. Why? <a href=\"http://touchlab.mit.edu/publications/2003_009.pdf\">According to an MIT study</a>, the average size of an adult index finger is 1.6-2 cm, which translates to 45-57 pixels on a mobile device.</li> \n  <li><strong>Invest in responsive email templates.</strong> Creating your own responsive template may be beyond your particular skill set or bandwidth. Sometimes, the most economical solution is to just license or buy email templates from the people who do it best.</li> \n </ul> <p><strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> HubSpot's default email templates are all optimized for mobile using responsive design. To access these templates, create a new email and look for the responsive option in the \"folders\" drop-down in the top left.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/responsive-email-1.png?width=287&amp;height=159&amp;name=responsive-email-1.png\" alt=\"responsive-email-1.png\" width=\"287\" height=\"159\" /></p> <h3>21. Preview and test your emails before sending them.</h3> <p>When you're finally ready to hit \"Send\" on your email, make a habit of double-checking one last time whether your emails look as good as you think they do. If your <a href=\"https://ecommerce-platforms.com/articles/email-marketing-services\">email marketing tool</a> lets you, go ahead and preview what your email looks like in different email clients and devices that are popular with your audience.</p> <p>(<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> You can preview what your emails look like in 30+ email clients right in the HubSpot Email App, as well as preview what your emails will look like on any device -- including desktop, tablet, or mobile devices. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/how-to-preview-your-emails-in-30-different-inboxes\">Click here to learn how</a>.)</p> <p>You should also send out a test version of your email before you send out the real deal to ensure it's working properly for everyone on your email list. Start incorporating these as final steps in your email review process. (<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> <a href=\"https://help.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/Email/How-do-I-send-a-test-email\">Learn how to test your emails here</a>.)</p> <h3>22. Don't be afraid to 'clean up' your contact list.</h3> <p>It's tempting to keep every subscriber you win on an email campaign until they personally choose to opt out. But just because they haven't opted out of an email newsletter doesn't mean they're still interested, and subscribers who have become inactive can kill your emails' open and clickthrough rates.</p> <p>To make sure you're only sending emails to the people who want to read them, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/26404/4-tips-to-keep-your-email-list-squeaky-clean.aspx\">clean up your email list</a> so that it excludes recipients who haven't opened a certain amount of emails in the campaign's recent history. This makes sure your emails' open and clickthrough rates reflect only your most interested readers, allowing you to collect more effective data on what is and isn't working in each email you send.</p> <p>On top of that, a good&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zerobounce.net/\">email list cleaning service</a> removes other email addresses that pose a risk to your inbox placement. “Invalid, abuse, and temporary emails will affect your sender reputation, so it’s best to weed them out,” says Liviu Tanase, CEO of ZeroBounce. “Your desire to grow your list is only natural, but you can’t afford to expand it at all costs. Emailing only valid and active addresses allows you to connect with people who care about your brand, and that’s what every email marketer wants,” Tanase adds.</p> <p>(<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> Lists that add and remove members based on their email behavior are called smart or \"active\" lists. Learn how to create them in <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/lists-user-guide/how-to-create-a-list-of-your-contacts\">HubSpot Academy</a>.)</p> <h3>23. Monitor each email's performance.</h3> <p>What's working in your email campaign this month might not work quite as well next month, and it's imperative that you check in on your emails' open and clickthrough rates for opportunities to improve your copy (to do this, of course, you'll need a tool to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">track your email analytics</a>).</p> <p>If after a month of email sends, for instance, you find 10 messages are getting double the engagement as the other 20, analyze them. What did you do differently in the higher performers? Was it the imagery? The subject line? Maybe you have more than one audience segment and one of them just isn't as interested in your current email content.</p> <p>Use your email performance data to run A/B tests that are designed to show you what your email recipients really want out of your newsletters, and steer into the trends that you see to make your email campaigns more desirable.</p> <p>Email marketing can be tough at times -- I'm right there with you.

You'll find out how to write one that gets read, what to include, and browse tons of templates to gain inspiration.</p> \n<p>You can dive straight in, or jump to the section you'd like to read.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How long should a cover letter be?</h2> \n<p>OK, so you're all fired up and ready to craft the cover letter of the hiring manager's dream. But how do you manage the fine balance between in-depth and overwhelming?</p> \n<p>A good cover letter is long enough to communicate why the recruiter should pick you but not long enough to bore them.</p> \n<p>One page is usually enough to cover everything you'll need to include, without losing the recruiter's attention. Let's go into those items in more detail:</p> \n<h3>Your Name and Address</h3> \n<p>Kick-off your cover letter by adding your name and address to the document.</p> \n<p>This step is pretty self-explanatory, but it allows the recruiter to easily connect your cover letter to your resume (especially if they're being printed).</p> \n<p>Your name and address also make it easier for the recruiter to get in touch with a job offer. And that's the aim of our letter, right?</p> \n<h3>Their Name and Address</h3> \n<p>Similarly, you should add the name and address of the company or person you're writing to.</p> \n<p>This shows you've done your research and allows the hiring manager to receive your letter if it's sent to a generic company email address.</p> \n<h3>The Date of Writing</h3> \n<p>Make it easier for the hiring manager to file your application by including the date on your cover letter.</p> \n<p>Even if you're not successful this time around, the company might store your letter and refer back to it when they're hiring for another position.</p> \n<h3>Why You're Writing the Letter</h3> \n<p>We know that the aim of a cover letter is to persuade the hiring manager you're the best fit for their job.</p> \n<p>Before you get to the good stuff, be sure to highlight the role you're applying for, as that can get lost.</p> \n<p>Something like this will usually do the trick:</p> \n<p><em>\"I'm writing to discuss the content strategist role at HubSpot.\"</em></p> \n<h3>Why You're a Perfect Fit for the Job</h3> \n<p>The next section of a cover letter structure is the fun part. It's where you'll convince the hiring manager they should hire you.</p> \n<p>In this section, answer these questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Why should this company hire you?</li> \n <li>What skills do you have that will help complete the job better than anyone else?</li> \n <li>What makes you a good employee?</li> \n <li>What qualifications do you have that are relevant to the role?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you've answered these, the recruiter will have a solid understanding of who you are, and (hopefully) be convinced to bring you on for an interview.</p> \n<h3>What You Can Offer the Company</h3> \n<p>Have you ever heard the advice to \"always sell yourself in a job application\"? That concept can be applied to cover letters as well.</p> \n<p>Businesses measure success in terms of results. The company looking for a new employee will want to know what they bring to the table and how you fit into their business goals. New candidates are rarely brought on board solely for the<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/soft-skills\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/soft-skills?_ga=2.185839593.1527963336.1644028103-1253290474.1644028103\">soft skills listed in their resume</a>.</p> \n<p>That's why this part of your cover letter structure is arguably the most important.</p> \n<p>In two paragraphs or less, show the business what you can do — and provide examples of how you've done it before.</p> \n<p>Not only does this give you the opportunity to show off your skills, but the company can picture the success you'll bring to their business by hiring you.</p> \n<h3>Your Availability</h3> \n<p>In the marketing world, we're always told the importance a call-to-action can make.</p> \n<p>Great cover letters end with a brief section on the candidate's earliest start date.</p> \n<h2>How to Format a Cover Letter</h2> \n<h3>How to Address a Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>Earlier, we mentioned the importance of addressing the hiring manager by their name and address. This proves you've done your research and ensures the cover letter lands in the right place.</p> \n<p>Personalized letters will always outperform generic ones, so including the first name of the recruiter can go a long way.</p> \n<p>But in a world where privacy is held close to our chest, you might need to do a bit of digging before finding the hiring manager's name.</p> \n<p>Luckily, you can use the power of the internet to do this.</p> \n<h4><strong>How to Find a Hiring Manager's Name</strong></h4> \n<p>Head over to LinkedIn and find the company's profile page.</p> \n<p>You can do this by entering their name into the search bar or searching for a link to their LinkedIn page on their company website.</p> \n<p>Then, click the number of employees to see all employees who are on LinkedIn:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"how to look up employer details to format cover letter\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<p>You'll then see a list of all employees along with their titles. Simply work your way through this list to find the most relevant contact.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that some employees do not have LinkedIn profiles, so you may not find them using this tactic. If you're unable to track down the hiring manager's name, a simple \"Dear Hiring Manager\" will work.</p> \n<h3>How to Open a Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>After you've addressed the cover letter to the most relevant person, you'll want to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Introduce yourself.</li> \n <li>List the role you're interested in.</li> \n <li>Explain your interest.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Here's an example:</p> \n<p>\"<em>Dear Hiring Manager, </em></p> \n<p><em>As an avid reader of the HubSpot Blog for the past five years, I am thrilled to submit my application for the content strategist role. I believe that my five years of experience working for B2B SaaS companies have equipped me with the skills needed to thrive in this role.\"</em></p> \n<p>In the next two paragraphs, highlight your relevant experience and include key details from each role.</p> \n<h3>How to Close a Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>Once you've covered</p> \n<p>Here are some great options:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Looking forward to hearing from you</li> \n <li>Sincerely</li> \n <li>Best Regards</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Then, sign the cover letter with your full name.</p> \n<h3>Should you include salary requirements?</h3> \n<p>The cover letter should focus on why you are a good fit for the role. Discussing salary requirements doesn’t fit at this stage of your application.</p> \n<p>Instead, it’s best to wait until you speak to a recruiter or someone from HR to discuss your expectations.</p> \n<h2>Are cover letters necessary?</h2> \n<p>Today, in many industries, cover letters are listed as optional. The question is, should you include one if it's optional?</p> \n<p>The answer isn’t exactly clear-cut.</p> \n<p>Some research would suggest that cover letters may not hold the same weight as they once did. However, a cover letter can help you stand out among the competition.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Are cover letters necessary job seekers believe getting a job will be harder than in previous years\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter-1.jpeg?width=500&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"\" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p>In a 2021 Job Seeker Nation Report by JobVite, <a href=\"https://www.jobvite.com/lp/2021-job-seeker-nation-report/\">69% of surveyed workers</a> believed getting a job will be much harder or somewhat harder than in previous years.

Even the best writers can struggle with communicating their skills in the right manner, but these tips will help you create a job-winning document.</p> \n<p>The structure of your cover letter is arguably the most important thing about writing one.</p> \n<p>Not only does a good structure help you to organize your points effectively, but it can help a hiring manager to quickly review the details you're sharing.</p> \n<h5 style=\"color: #666666; font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"color: #425b76; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Featured Resource:<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/cover-letter-templates?hubs_post-cta=header\"> </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/cover-letter-templates?hubs_post-cta=header\">5 Free Cover Letter Templates</a></span></h5> \n<p><img alt=\"Cover-Letter-Templates\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter.png?width=250&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/cover-letter-templates?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download these free cover letter templates</a> to write a stand-out cover letter.</p> \n<h2>7 Tips for Writing Great Cover Letters</h2> \n<p>So, you've crafted a cover letter and you're almost ready to hit send.</p> \n<p>Before attaching to your resume and hoping for the best, use these seven tips to make sure your cover letter is as great as can be.</p> \n<h3>1. Keep it succinct.</h3> \n<p>Earlier, we mentioned how the best cover letters strike the perfect balance in their length.</p> \n<p>Our best tip for writing cover letters is to avoid adding fluff that fails to add value. Every line should highlight why you're the best fit for the role.</p> \n<p>In addition, cut the jargon and corporate-speak that hiring managers have heard before.</p> \n<p>Yes, professionalism is important, but be harsh and critical when editing your cover letter. If a sentence doesn't add value, get rid of it.</p> \n<h3>2. Tailor it for the company and position you're applying for.</h3> \n<p>The one-size-fits-all approach doesn't fit well with cover letters.</p> \n<p>You're applying for different roles at various companies, but don't let a change in name and address be the only updates you make.</p> \n<p>Remember that a cover letter should explain why you should be hired for a specific role instead of anyone else. It's highly unlikely that multiple companies will hire for exactly the same position, so take some time to personalize your cover letter for every position you're applying for.</p> \n<h3>3. Don't repeat what's on your resume.</h3> \n<p>Although cover letters are submitted along with resumes, be wary of making them carbon copies of one another.</p> \n<p>Instead, use the documents to compliment each other by:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Including new skills.</li> \n <li>Elaborating on how your qualifications would help you in the role.</li> \n <li>Sharing how specific experience gives you an advantage over other candidates.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you need to include the same thing in both documents, add \"as listed in my resume …\" rather than copy and pasting the same content.</p> \n<h3>4. Include data-backed examples.</h3> \n<p>When referencing experience from your resume, use your cover letter as an opportunity to explain in detail — with examples.</p> \n<p>Examples allow the company to picture the success you could bring if they hired you, rather than the person next in their resume pile. But, data-backed examples give an extra edge.</p> \n<p>Let's use an example. Which of these options is more impressive?</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>I increased leads for the company.</li> \n <li>I increased leads by 35% in one month through a single blog post, which became the company's highest lead driver.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>It's option B, right? That's because it's descriptive and shows results.</p> \n<h3>5. Tell a story.</h3> \n<p>Following on from the previous step, you could elaborate on your data-backed examples by telling a story.</p> \n<p>Storytelling helps with relatability and gives a hint of your personality in a cover letter. It also makes the recruiter remember your cover letter amongst a sea of other one-page documents in their review pile.</p> \n<p>However, this cover letter tip comes with a warning: Don't overdo it and make sure it's relevant.</p> \n<h3>6. Get a second pair of eyes on it.</h3> \n<p>Even the best writers make mistakes, but they can leave a negative first impression.</p> \n<p>That's why our sixth cover letter tip is to get a second pair of eyes on it.</p> \n<p>Email it to a friend or ask a family member to glance over it before you hit \"send.\" Ask them to highlight any spelling mistakes or suggestions to improve how you're communicating with the person reading it.</p> \n<p>You never get a second chance to make a first impression. Seeing as though a cover letter is one of the first documents a recruiter sees, try to make it perfect.</p> \n<h3>7. Be unique.</h3> \n<p>Finally, make your cover letter unique.</p> \n<p>If you're applying for a creative role, experiment with colors, subheadings, and layouts.</p> \n<p>If you're applying for more of a traditional role, be wary. Not everyone is a fan of bright, bold cover letters, but you can scope your limits by getting a feel of their company culture.</p> \n<p>Are they strict and professional, or does the company like to have fun?

Creative Director </strong></h3> \n<p>Nowadays, brands are expected to create top-notch content across platforms. To successfully reach new audiences and increase sales, you'll want to have strong social media, content marketing, and video marketing strategies — to name a few.</p> \n<p>As Wistia's Creative Director, Adam Day, puts it, \"In the context of today's media landscape, the opportunity for brands to express themselves through multiple mediums is more attainable than ever — and consumers are demanding more than ever, too.\"</p> \n<p>Day adds, \"It's not just about blog posts anymore. Video consumption, alone, is <a href=\"https://wistia.com/about/state-of-video\">up 121% from 2019</a>, and in a recent survey of Wistia customers, we learned that most companies are increasing their production budgets by more than 10% this year. Businesses need someone who can oversee the creative execution of all this work while maintaining the consistency and quality it takes to have a world-class brand.\"</p> \n<p>That's all well and good. But what, exactly, does a creative director do?</p> \n<p>\"A great creative director develops a clear and engaging visual identity for your brand,\" Mark Tanner, Co-Founder and COO of <a href=\"https://qwilr.com/\">Qwilr</a>, told me. \"Visual consistency communicates professionalism, attention to detail, and builds buyer confidence in a brand's capabilities.\"</p> \n<blockquote>\n Tanner told me, \"The creative director should 'own' how a brand is represented across all visual assets, from your website to ads to product brochures to sales proposals.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>Tanner continues, \"And if you think the impact of a creative director is limited to aesthetics, think again. According to a <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design\">study by McKinsey</a>, design-driven companies consistently outperform their competitors, demonstrating the ROI potential of a good design experience.\"</p> \n<p>A creative director can ultimately help your business hit its sales goals by ensuring your marketing materials are highly optimized, effective, and on-brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Tanner told me, \"<a href=\"https://pages.qwilr.com/SaaS-Buyer-Experience-Study-2021-Full-Report-tPfTLda8SiOI\">One out of three buyers</a>&nbsp;are influenced by the quality of your sales materials, and that influence can either be positive, or cause your buyer to go with your competition, instead. It's no wonder the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/art-directors.htm\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects creative director demand to grow by 11%</a>, faster than the average for all occupations.\"</p> \n<p>Among other things, you can expect a creative director to guide your overarching content strategy; build and manage a successful production process; lead, inspire, and nurture your creative team to drive brand direction forward; and own specific KPIs related to content marketing.</p> \n<p>Jenny Coppola, Head of Brand &amp; Communications at<a href=\"https://teamwork.com/\" style=\"color: #1e1f21; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.teamwork.com/\">Teamwork</a>, says, \"Creative directors should focus on ensuring that all brand touchpoints are cohesive and consistent, both visually and in terms of messaging, while also shepherding the idea of experimentation and concerted risk-taking within the team.\"</p> \n<blockquote>\n Coppola says, \"Your team's creative director should always be thinking ahead to what the future could look like for the brand and the market as a whole, which means pushing ideas further and challenging the status quo of what's expected.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>Coppola adds, \"Equally as important, creative directors should be close to the customer, understanding what makes them tick inside and out. Knowing your target customer and being able to see the world through their eyes is the best way to build a brand that resonates with them.\"</p> \n<p>If you can only hire one new marketer in 2022, you'll want to strongly consider the importance of having a creative director if you don't already have one. Even a small but mighty team of marketers needs a creative director to nurture their strengths and guide the overarching vision.</p> \n<p>Additionally, if your business works with freelancers, agencies, or contractors, a creative director can help streamline those processes and ensure consistency across marketing channels.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adam%20day%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png?width=1200&amp;name=adam%20day%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png\" alt=\"adam day on top marketing role of 2022\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"></p> \n<h3><strong>2. Creative Assistant </strong></h3> \n<p>The second most-voted for role in 2022 is a creative assistant.</p> \n<p>If you already have someone in a director-level or manager-level role, it makes sense to consider how you might help alleviate some of their responsibilities by hiring an assistant.</p> \n<p>A creative assistant is an entry-level professional who will create promotional materials for your brand — those materials could include promotional videos, advertising campaigns, press releases, or social media posts.</p> \n<p>A creative assistant will also help your creative director or manager by handling the day-to-day creation of specific marketing materials — for instance, they might write copy, produce designs or infographics, or conduct market research to identify future trends and campaign ideas.</p> \n<p>A creative assistant can be a strategic, long-term play for your team. A creative assistant is an entry-level position, which means it's someone who is often new to the field of marketing.</p> \n<p>You might hire a creative assistant with impressive design skills, or a strong knowledge of the various social media platforms, and foster his or her growth on your team.</p> \n<p>Simply put, a creative assistant is a hire who will continue to grow on your team and could ultimately have a strong impact on the future of your brand's marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Content Marketing Manager </strong></h3> \n<p>\"Let's face it,\" Dan Seavers, Talkwalker's Content Marketing Manager, told me,</p> \n<blockquote>\n \"Consumers are rapidly changing. They are savvier, smarter, and more active in their research. And they no longer want to be sold to. They want to be educated, entertained, excited, enthralled, anything … but not sold to.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>Seavers told me that this shift in consumer behavior has led to content marketing as an essential component for any business' bottom line.</p> \n<p>And a strong <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing\">content marketing strategy</a> needs a content marketing manager.</p> \n<p>Why? Well, as Seavers puts it, \"To do [content marketing] properly, you need content. A lot of content. We're talking blogs, videos, podcasts, tweets, reports, case studies, TikTok dances, and more — all weaved into an epic journey that leads consumers from discovery to purchase.\"</p> \n<p>Unbounce's VP of Marketing, Meg Sakakibara, agrees that a content marketing manager is vital for any marketing team.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sakakibara says, \"Content marketing managers are critical for brands today that need a voice that cuts through the noise, builds trust, and ensures content isn't just a pleasant accessory — it drives conversions.\"</p> \n<p>Sakakibara adds, \"After analyzing the most influential elements for conversion in 40,000 landing pages, Unbounce found that copy influenced conversion more than 2X as much as design did. Content isn't just the king/queen — it's the whole kingdom. By investing in content marketing and new technologies like<a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-intelligence/\">&nbsp;Unbounce's Conversion Intelligence Platform</a>, people are using content and optimization to convert more leads, sales, and sign-ups to win in this competitive space.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/meg%20sakakibara%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png?width=1200&amp;name=meg%20sakakibara%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png\" alt=\"meg sakakibara on top marketing role of 2022\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"></p> \n<p>So what should you look for in a content marketing manager?</p> \n<p>Among other things, an effective content marketing manager will execute digital content strategies across platforms, drive traffic and engagement, have a deep understanding of what types of content perform best on which channels, and consistently evaluate how each campaign performs — and shift when necessary.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Seaver told me,&nbsp;\"To be good, your content marketing manager should always have one eye on your consumers' ecosystem. <em>Where do they cluster online? What do they talk about? What are they looking for in a product? What problem do they have that you can solve? </em><a href=\"https://www.talkwalker.com/blog/content-strategy\">Their content strategy</a>&nbsp;will answer all of these questions, piece by piece. Slowly building that brand and consumer relationship from awareness — to having your consumers wonder how they can go on without you.\"</p> \n<p>Finally, a good content marketing manager needs to be a strong fit for your brand and goals. Content marketing is about delivering unique value to your intended audiences — which means your marketing manager needs to know, inside and out, who your target audience is and what they care about.</p> \n<p>As Microsoft's Group Marketing Manager Nora Xu puts it, \"It goes beyond a single touchpoint with an action to purchase your product, to a flywheel of inspirational and educational content that meets them where they are. On the <a href=\"https://ads.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Advertising</a> brand marketing team, I look for people who can get into the mindset of our audience and create content that makes them feel seen and connected with our brand.\" &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ultimately, <em>you</em> know what's best for your business needs. Take a careful look at your team's current strengths, and aim to identify a role that can help fill in the gaps.</p> \n<p>Once you're ready to begin the recruitment process, take a look at these <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-job-descriptions\">17 marketing job descriptions</a> to attract the right hire.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"state of marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftop-marketing-roles&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png","linkMd5":"d895a86b573cb7af39e8c32a7ccebd00","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn88@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-908_0a6311d55189482b.webp","destWidth":418,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4983,"destBytes":6716,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn88@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-908_0a6311d55189482b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adam%20day%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png?width=1200&name=adam%20day%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-10-741_ed02f2f3a7ea9da4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/meg%20sakakibara%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png?width=1200&name=meg%20sakakibara%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn64@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-13-446_5352c828686f89a0.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn16@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-09-690_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftop-marketing-roles&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn94@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-14-832_aee9fbf5a5b1d711.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705032},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"How to Insert a Checkbox in Excel in 4 Easy Steps","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inserting-check-box-excel","description":"<p>Adding a checkbox to your workbook may sound simple but it can expand the possibilities of what you can do in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/microsoft-excel\">Excel</a>.</p>  \n<p>From checklists to graphs, there’s so much you can do.

Something that works for one company may not necessarily work for another. <span>In fact, conversion rate optimization (CRO) experts hate the term \"best practices\" because it may not actually be the best practice for&nbsp;</span><em>you</em><i>. </i>But, this kind of testing can be complex if you’re not careful.</p> \n<p>Let’s go over how A/B testing works to ensure that you don’t make incorrect assumptions about what your audience likes.</p> \n<h2>How does A/B testing Work?</h2> \n<p>To run an A/B test, you need to create two different versions of one piece of content, with changes to a single <strong>variable</strong>. Then, you'll show these two versions to two similarly sized audiences and analyze which one performed better over a specific period of time (long enough to make accurate conclusions about your results).</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/a-b-testing-explanation.jpg?width=650&amp;name=a-b-testing-explanation.jpg\" alt=\"Explanation of what a/b testing is\" title=\"explanation of what a/b testing is\" width=\"650\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://cxl.com/blog/ab-testing-guide/\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>A/B testing helps marketers observe how one version of a piece of marketing content performs alongside another. Here are two types of A/B tests you might conduct in an effort to increase your website's conversion rate:</p> \n<h3>Example 1: User Experience Test</h3> \n<p>Perhaps you want to see if moving a certain call-to-action (CTA) button to the top of your homepage instead of keeping it in the sidebar will improve its click-through rate.</p> \n<p>To A/B test this theory, you'd create another, alternative web page that uses the new CTA placement. The existing design with the sidebar CTA — or the \"<strong>control</strong>\" — is Version A. Version B with the CTA at the top is the \"<strong>challenger</strong>.\" Then, you'd test these two versions by showing each of them to a predetermined percentage of site visitors. Ideally, the percentage of visitors seeing either version is the same.</p> \n<p>Learn how to easily A/B test a component of your website with <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/cos-pages-editor/a/b-test-a-page\">HubSpot's Marketing Hub</a>.</p> \n<h3>Example 2: Design Test</h3> \n<p>Perhaps you want to find out if changing the color of your call-to-action (CTA) button can increase its click-through rate.</p> \n<p>To A/B test this theory, you'd design an alternative CTA button with a different button color that leads to the <em>same</em> landing page as the control. If you usually use a red call-to-action button in your marketing content, and the green variation receives more clicks after your A/B test, this could merit changing the default color of your call-to-action buttons to green from now on.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">To learn more about A/B testing, download our free introductory guide here.</a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>A/B Testing in Marketing</h2> \n<p>A/B testing has a multitude of benefits to a marketing team, depending on what it is you decide to test. Above all, though, these tests are valuable to a business because they're low in cost but high in reward.</p> \n<p>Let's say you employ a content creator with a salary of $50,000/year. This content creator publishes five articles per week for the company blog, totaling 260 articles per year. If the average post on the company's blog generates 10 leads, you could say it costs just over $192 to generate 10 leads for the business ($50,000 salary ÷ 260 articles = $192 per article). That's a solid chunk of change.</p> \n<p>Now, if you ask this content creator to spend two days developing an A/B test on <em>one</em> article, instead of writing <em>two</em> articles in that time period, you might burn $192 because you're publishing one fewer article. But if that A/B test finds you can increase each article's conversion rate from 10 to 20 leads, you just spent $192 to potentially double the number of customers your business gets from your blog.</p> \n<p>If the test fails, of course, you lost $192 — but now you can make your <em>next</em> A/B test even more educated. If that second test succeeds in doubling your blog's conversion rate, you ultimately spent $384 to potentially double your company's revenue. No matter how many times your A/B test fails, its eventual success will almost always outweigh the cost to conduct it.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>There are many types of split tests you can run to make the experiment worth it in the end. Here are some common goals marketers have for their business when A/B testing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Increased Website Traffic:</strong> Testing different blog post titles or webpage titles can change the number of people who click on that hyperlinked title to get to your website. This can increase website traffic as a result.</li> \n <li><strong>Higher Conversion Rate:</strong> Testing different locations, colors, or even anchor text on your CTAs can change the number of people who click these CTAs to get to a landing page. This can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-test-landing-page-form-copy\">increase the number of people who fill out forms on your website</a>, submit their contact info to you, and \"convert\" into a lead.</li> \n <li><strong>Lower Bounce Rate:</strong> If your website visitors leave (or \"bounce\") quickly after visiting your website, testing different blog post introductions, fonts, or featured images can reduce this bounce rate and retain more visitors.</li> \n <li><strong>Lower Cart Abandonment:</strong> Ecommerce businesses see an average of <a href=\"https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate\">70% of customers leave their website with items in their shopping cart</a>. This is known as \"shopping cart abandonment\" and is, of course, detrimental to any online store. Testing different product photos, check-out page designs, and even where shipping costs are displayed can lower this abandonment rate.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, let's walk through the checklist for setting up, running, and measuring an A/B test.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Conduct A/B Testing<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebody&amp;_ga=2.4361779.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\"></a></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebody&amp;_ga=2.4361779.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kissmetrics_Abtestkit_headerimage.png?width=650&amp;name=kissmetrics_Abtestkit_headerimage.png\" alt=\"ab test graphic\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebody&amp;_ga=2.4361779.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\"></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Follow along with our free A/B testing kit with everything you need to run A/B testing including a test tracking template, a how-to guide for instruction and inspiration, and a statistical significance calculator to see if your tests were wins, losses, or inconclusive.</em></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebody&amp;_ga=2.4361779.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\"></a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Before the A/B Test</h3> \n<p>Let's cover the steps to take before you start your A/B test.</p> \n<h4>1. Pick one variable to test.</h4> \n<p>As you optimize your web pages and emails, you might find <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/26785/20-variables-every-marketer-should-be-testing.aspx\">there are a number of variables you want to test</a>. But to evaluate how effective a change is, you'll want to isolate one \"<strong>independent variable</strong>\" and measure its performance. Otherwise, you can't be sure which variable was responsible for changes in performance.</p> \n<p>You can test more than one variable for a single web page or email — just be sure you're testing them one at a time.</p> \n<p>To determine your variable, look at the elements in your marketing resources and their possible alternatives for design, wording, and layout. Other things you might test include email subject lines, sender names, and different ways to personalize your emails.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that even simple changes, like changing the image in your email <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-ab-testing-ht\">or the words on your call-to-action button</a>, can drive big improvements. In fact, these sorts of changes are usually easier to measure than the bigger ones.</p> \n<p><strong>Note: </strong>There are some times when it makes more sense to test multiple variables rather than a single variable. This is a process called multivariate testing. If you're wondering whether you should run an A/B test versus a multivariate test, <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/resources/multivariate-test-vs-ab-test/\">here's a helpful article from Optimizely</a> that compares the two processes.</p> \n<h4>2. Identify your goal.</h4> \n<p>Although you'll measure several metrics during any one test, choose a primary metric to focus on <em>before</em> you run the test. In fact, do it before you even set up the second variation. This is your \"<strong>dependent variable</strong>,\" which changes based on how you manipulate the independent variable.</p> \n<p>Think about where you want this dependent variable to be at the end of the split test. You might even state an official <strong>hypothesis</strong> and examine your results based on this prediction.</p> \n<p>If you wait until afterward to think about which metrics are important to you, what your goals are, and how the changes you're proposing might affect user behavior, then you might not set up the test in the most effective way.</p> \n<h4>3. Create a 'control' and a 'challenger.'</h4> \n<p>You now have your independent variable, your dependent variable, and your desired outcome. Use this information to set up the unaltered version of whatever you're testing as your control scenario. If you're testing a web page, this is the unaltered page as it exists already. If you're testing a landing page, this would be the landing page design and copy you would normally use.</p> \n<p>From there, build a challenger — the altered website, landing page, or email that you’ll test against your control. For example, if you're wondering whether <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-proof-examples-landing-pages\">adding a testimonial to a landing page</a> would make a difference in conversions, set up your control page with no testimonials. Then, create your challenger with a testimonial.</p> \n<h4>4. Split your sample groups equally and randomly.</h4> \n<p>For tests where you have more control over the audience — like with emails — you need to test with two or more audiences that are equal in order to have conclusive results.</p> \n<p>How you do this will vary depending on the A/B testing tool you use. If you're a <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-utilize-ab-testing-in-email\">HubSpot Enterprise customer conducting an A/B test on an email</a>, for example, HubSpot will automatically split traffic to your variations so that each variation gets a random sampling of visitors.</p> \n<h4>5. Determine your sample size (if applicable).</h4> \n<p>How you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-a-b-test-sample-size-testing-time\">determine your sample size</a> will also vary depending on your A/B testing tool, as well as the type of A/B test you're running.</p> \n<p>If you're A/B testing an email, you'll probably want to send an A/B test to a subset of your list that is large enough to achieve statistically significant results. Eventually, you'll pick a winner and send the winning variation on to the rest of the list. (See \"The Science of Split Testing\" ebook at the end of this article for more on calculating your sample size.)</p> \n<p>If you're a HubSpot Enterprise customer, you'll have some help determining the size of your sample group using a slider. It'll let you do a 50/50 A/B test of any sample size — although all other sample splits require a list of at least 1,000 recipients.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-a-b-testing-2.png?width=650&amp;name=how-to-do-a-b-testing-2.png\" alt=\"ab testing sample size settings in hubspot\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>If you're testing something that <em>doesn't</em> have a finite audience, like a web page, then how long you keep your test running will directly affect your sample size. You'll need to let your test run long enough to obtain a substantial number of views. Otherwise, it will be hard to tell whether there was a statistically significant difference between variations.</p> \n<h4>6. Decide how significant your results need to be.</h4> \n<p>Once you've picked your goal metric, think about how significant your results need to be to justify choosing one variation over another. Statistical significance is a super important part of the A/B testing process that's often misunderstood. If you need a refresher, I recommend <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketers-guide-understanding-statistical-significance\">reading this blog post on statistical significance from a marketing standpoint</a>.</p> \n<p>The higher the percentage of your confidence level, the more sure you can be about your results. In most cases, you'll want a confidence level of 95% minimum — preferably even 98% — especially if it was a time-intensive experiment to set up. However, sometimes it makes sense to use a lower confidence rate if you don't need the test to be as stringent.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-rheault-322b051b\">Matt Rheault</a>, a senior software engineer at HubSpot, likes to think of statistical significance like placing a bet. What odds are you comfortable placing a bet on? Saying \"I'm 80% sure this is the right design and I'm willing to bet everything on it\" is similar to running an A/B test to 80% significance and then declaring a winner.</p> \n<p>Rheault also says you’ll likely want a higher confidence threshold when testing for something that only slightly improves conversion rate. Why? Because random variance is more likely to play a bigger role.</p> \n<p>\"An example where we could feel safer lowering our confidence threshold is an experiment that will likely improve conversion rate by 10% or more, such as a redesigned hero section,\" he explained.</p> \n<p>\"The takeaway here is that the more radical the change, the less scientific we need to be process-wise. The more specific the change (button color, microcopy, etc.), the more scientific we should be because the change is less likely to have a large and noticeable impact on conversion rate.\"</p> \n<h4>7. Make sure you're only running one test at a time on any campaign.</h4> \n<p>Testing more than one thing for a single campaign — even if it's not on the same exact asset — can complicate results. For example, if you A/B test an email campaign that directs to a landing page at the same time that you’re A/B testing that landing page, how can you know which change caused the increase in leads?</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>During the A/B Test</h3> \n<p>Let's cover the steps to take during your A/B test.</p> \n<h4>8. Use an A/B testing tool.</h4> \n<p>To do an A/B test on your website or in an email, you'll need to use an A/B testing tool. If you're a HubSpot Enterprise customer, the HubSpot software has features that let you A/B test emails (<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-utilize-ab-testing-in-email\">learn how here</a>), calls-to-action (<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cta-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-an-a-b-variation-test-for-calls-to-action\">learn how here</a>), and landing pages (<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/landing-page-user-guide-v2/how-to-ab-test-landing-pages\">learn how here</a>).</p> \n<p>For non-HubSpot Enterprise customers, other options include <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\">Google Analytics</a>, which lets you A/B test up to 10 full versions of a single web page and compare their performance using a random sample of users.</p> \n<h4>9. Test both variations simultaneously.</h4> \n<p>Timing plays a significant role in your marketing campaign’s results, whether it's time of day, day of the week, or month of the year. If you were to run Version A during one month and Version B a month later, how would you know whether the performance change was caused by the different design or the different month?</p> \n<p>When you run A/B tests, you'll need to run the two variations at the same time, otherwise you may be left second-guessing your results.</p> \n<p>The only exception here is if you're testing timing itself, like finding the optimal times for sending out emails. This is a great thing to test because depending on what your business offers and who your subscribers are, the optimal time for subscriber engagement can vary significantly by industry and target market.</p> \n<h4>10. Give the A/B test enough time to produce useful data.</h4> \n<p>Again, you'll want to make sure that you let your test run long enough to obtain a substantial sample size. Otherwise, it'll be hard to tell whether there was a statistically significant difference between the two variations.</p> \n<p>How long is long enough? Depending on your company and how you execute the A/B test, getting statistically significant results could happen in hours ... or days ... or weeks. A big part of how long it takes to get statistically significant results is how much traffic you get — so if your business doesn't get a lot of traffic to your website, it'll take much longer for you to run an A/B test.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-a-b-test-sample-size-testing-time\">Read this blog post to learn more about sample size and timing</a>.</p> \n<h4>11. Ask for feedback from real users.</h4> \n<p>A/B testing has a lot to do with quantitative data ... but that won't necessarily help you understand <em>why</em> people take certain actions over others. While you're running your A/B test, why not collect qualitative feedback from real users?</p> \n<p>One of the best ways to ask people for their opinions is <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/art-asking-survey-questions\">through a survey or poll</a>. You might add an exit survey on your site that asks visitors why they didn't click on a certain CTA, or one on your thank-you pages that asks visitors why they clicked a button or filled out a form.</p> \n<p>You might find, for example, that a lot of people clicked on a call-to-action leading them to an ebook, but once they saw the price, they didn't convert. That kind of information will give you a lot of insight into why your users are behaving in certain ways.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>After the A/B Test</h3> \n<p>Finally, let's cover the steps to take after your A/B test.</p> \n<h4>12. Focus on your goal metric.</h4> \n<p>Again, although you'll be measuring multiple metrics, keep your focus on that primary goal metric when you do your analysis.</p> \n<p>For example, if you tested two variations of an email and chose leads as your primary metric, don’t get caught up on open rate or click-through rate. You might see a high click-through rate and poor conversion rates, in which case you might end up choosing the variation that had a lower click-through rate in the end.</p> \n<h4>13. Measure the significance of your results using our A/B testing calculator.</h4> \n<p>Now that you've determined which variation performs the best, it's time to determine whether your results are statistically significant. In other words, are they enough to justify a change?</p> \n<p>To find out, you'll need to conduct a test of statistical significance. You could do that manually ... or you could just plug in the results from your experiment to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/ab-test-calculator\">our free A/B testing calculator</a>.</p> \n<p>For each variation you tested, you'll be prompted to input the total number of tries, like emails sent or impressions seen. Then, enter the number of goals it completed — generally you'll look at clicks, but this could also be other types of conversions.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-a-b-testing-calculator.png?width=1500&amp;name=hubspot-a-b-testing-calculator.png\" alt=\"hubspot ab testing calculator\" title=\"hubspot-a-b-testing-calculator.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>The calculator will spit out the confidence level your data produces for the winning variation. Then, measure that number against the value you chose to determine statistical significance.</p> \n<h4>14. Take action based on your results.</h4> \n<p>If one variation is statistically better than the other, you have a winner. Complete your test by disabling the losing variation in your A/B testing tool.</p> \n<p>If neither variation is statistically better, you've just learned that the variable you tested didn't impact results, and you'll have to mark the test as inconclusive. In this case, stick with the original variation, or run another test. You can use the failed data to help you figure out a new iteration on your new test.</p> \n<p>While A/B tests help you impact results on a case-by-case basis, you can also apply the lessons you learn from each test and apply it to future efforts.</p> \n<p>For example, if you've conducted A/B tests in your email marketing and have repeatedly found that using numbers in email subject lines generates better clickthrough rates, you might want to consider using that tactic in more of your emails.</p> \n<h4>15. Plan your next A/B test.</h4> \n<p>The A/B test you just finished may have helped you discover a new way to make your marketing content more effective — but don't stop there. There’s always room for more optimization.</p> \n<p>You can even try conducting an A/B test on another feature of the same web page or email you just did a test on. For example, if you just tested a headline on a landing page, why not do a new test on body copy? Or a color scheme? Or images? Always keep an eye out for opportunities to increase conversion rates and leads.</p> \n<p>You can use HubSpot’s A/B Test Tracking Kit to plan and organize your experiments.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ab%20test%20tracking.png?width=1410&amp;name=ab%20test%20tracking.png\" alt=\"ab test tracking\" width=\"1410\" style=\"width: 1410px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?_ga=2.268392270.1136205898.1644610869-1937536568.1644610869\">Download This Template Now</a></p> \n<h2>How to Read A/B Testing Results</h2> \n<p>As a marketer, you know the value of automation. Given this, you likely use software that handles the A/B test calculations for you — a huge help. But, after the calculations are done, you need to know how to read your results. Let’s go over how.</p> \n<h3>1. Check your goal metric.</h3> \n<p>The first step in reading your A/B test results is looking at your goal metric, which is usually conversion rate. After you’ve plugged your results into your A/B testing calculator, you’ll get two results for each version you’re testing. You’ll also get a significant result for each of your variations.</p> \n<h3>2. Compare your conversion rates.</h3> \n<p>By looking at your results, you’ll likely be able to tell if one of your variations performed better than the other. However, the true test of success is whether the results you have are statistically significant. This means that one variation performed better than the other at a significant level because, say, the CTA text was more compelling.</p> \n<p>Say, for example, Variation A had a 16.04% conversion rate and variation B had a 16.02% conversion rate, and your confidence interval of statistical significance is 95%. Variation A has a higher conversion rate, but the results are not statistically significant, meaning that Variation A won’t significantly improve your overall conversion rate.</p> \n<h3>3. Segment your audiences for further insights.</h3> \n<p>Regardless of significance, it's valuable to break down your results by audience segment to understand how each key area responded to your variations. Common variables for segmenting audiences are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Visitor type, or which version performed best for new visitors versus repeat visitors.</li> \n <li>Device type, or which version performed best on mobile versus desktop.</li> \n <li>Traffic source, or which version performed best based on where traffic to your two variations originated.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let’s go over some examples of A/B experiments you could run for your business.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>A/B Testing Examples</h2> \n<p>We’ve discussed how A/B tests are used in marketing and how to conduct one — but how do they actually look in practice?</p> \n<p>As you might guess, we run many A/B tests to increase engagement and drive conversions across our platform. Here are five examples of A/B tests to inspire your own experiments.</p> \n<h3>1. Site Search</h3> \n<p>Site search bars help users quickly find what they’re after on a particular website. HubSpot found from previous analysis that visitors who interacted with its site search bar were more likely to convert on a blog post. So, we ran an A/B test in an attempt to increase engagement with the search bar.</p> \n<p>In this test, search bar functionality was the independent variable and views on the content offer thank you page was the dependent variable. We used one control condition and three challenger conditions in the experiment.</p> \n<p>In the control condition (variant A), the search bar remained unchanged.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-a-b-testing-search-bar-control.png?width=530&amp;name=how-to-do-a-b-testing-search-bar-control.png\" alt=\"control condition in the hubspot search bar A B test\" width=\"530\" style=\"width: 530px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>In variant B, the search bar was made larger and more visually prominent, and the placeholder text was set to “search by topic.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ViXecYg9kH0cxCiinUo2MEC_o5Ou7k0ki1H2w-iuxEvK4DVLNWVFcGApFkFN4lxWuKgS0gYd0AQM90ZhdVuGILOJbhPtiDkpQD1GDPuudRacQWOtLrjlexJZnU2IHOb-ewbP1-4P\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\" alt=\"variant b of the hubspot search bar AB test\"></p> \n<p>Variant C appeared identical to variant B, but only searched the HubSpot Blog rather than the entire website.</p> \n<p>In variant D, the search bar was made larger but the placeholder text was set to “search the blog.” This variant also searched only the HubSpot Blog</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v6MZzCEA1LPhNPyF584H6dUQ83SPGRgYAi-7d3oA_zNmYA5yuuRbnIHKg3pc2MUj1YQ9j8km9lNpgUSWS7ENVJTQeJfgmQSkFiwIxp8ZjHe5QRnxXshmfUYXfSgb0gy8jwdRKH4F\" width=\"350\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 350px;\" alt=\"variant c of the hubspot search bar AB test\"></p> \n<p>We found variant D to be the most effective: It increased conversions by 3.4% over the control and increased the percentage of users who used the search bar by 6.5%.</p> \n<h3>2. Mobile CTAs</h3> \n<p>HubSpot uses several CTAs for content offers in our blog posts, including ones in the body of posts as well as at the bottom of the page. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ab-testing-ctas\">We test these CTAs extensively</a> for optimize their performance.</p> \n<p>For our mobile users, we ran an A/B test to see which type of bottom-of-page CTA converted best. For our independent variable, we altered the design of the CTA bar. Specifically, we used one control and three challengers in our test. For our dependent variables, we used pageviews on the CTA thank you page and CTA clicks.</p> \n<p>The control condition included our normal placement of CTAs at the bottom of posts. In variant B, the CTA had no close or minimize option.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-b-2.png?width=300&amp;name=how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-b-2.png\" alt=\"variant B of the hubspot mobile CTA AB test\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">In variant C, mobile readers could close the CTA by tapping an X icon. Once it was closed out, it wouldn’t reappear.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-c-2.png?width=300&amp;name=how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-c-2.png\" alt=\"variant C of the hubspot mobile CTA AB test\" width=\"300\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 300px;\"></p> \n<p>In variant D, we included an option to minimize the CTA with an up/down caret.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-d-2.jpg?width=600&amp;name=how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-d-2.jpg\" alt=\"variant d of hubspot's mobile cta A B test\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Our tests found all variants to be successful. Variant D was the most successful, with a 14.6% increase in conversions over the control. This was followed by variant C with an 11.4% increase and variant B with a 7.9% increase.</p> \n<h3>3. Author CTAs</h3> \n<p>In another CTA experiment, HubSpot tested whether adding the word “free” and other descriptive language to author CTAs at the top of blog posts would increase content leads. Past research suggested that using “free” in CTA text would drive more conversions and that text specifying the type of content offered would be helpful for SEO and accessibility.</p> \n<p>In the test, the independent variable was CTA text and the main dependent variable was conversion rate on the content offer form.</p> \n<p>In the control condition, author CTA text was unchanged (see the orange button in the image below).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/n1OzWBuiCbJaR4e1VRrsyvuUHCLSuZc2xkYC-ovXP5DBPkYODIuK2A62Svs1IzuBWaeo3QN4dzkHyLRpU7sY4OLi6eOPm5U1WY7CM4SPjL-_rDx9q_RLB9e0twfcWn0Q-YK87c9K\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant A of the author CTA AB test\"></p> \n<p>In variant B, the word “free” was added to the CTA text.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GFVdnuSnm1W6pD64fPCw5D9bCrYtFbevTczl4wluvIxNOv-Qm_9G4FRfd5dYZubqdZDuHA7A3lLw2-oZO9SWvLx5JVPKhkDQdm-llrX3cW41bqeh-73z1kkEBZF1VP8FTXOqQMK3\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant B of the author CTA AB test\"></p> \n<p>In variant C, descriptive wording was added to the CTA text in addition to “free.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QeqWmdjj84siDfYVc1eucUicRHouXKgN5MkeeFFMQiwiwhKz-6DUCP90rF1hFRl0rRq41F2Ffon4C5kLnz-8IqoaFeT0BFdXardJQDE7RGp_BXH4K3u8obwZHPpYlO6-dDDkSyy1\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant C of the author CTA AB test\"></p> \n<p>Interestingly, variant B saw a loss in form submissions, down by 14% compared to the control. This was unexpected, since including \"free\" in content offer text is widely considered a best practice.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, form submissions in variant C outperformed the control by 4%. It was concluded that adding descriptive text to the author CTA helped users understand the offer and thus made them more likely to download.</p> \n<h3>4. Blog Table of Contents</h3> \n<p>To help users better navigate the blog, HubSpot tested a new Table of Contents (TOC) module. The goal was to improve user experience by presenting readers with their desired content more quickly. We also tested whether adding a CTA to this TOC module would increase conversions.</p> \n<p>The independent variable of this A/B test was the inclusion and type of TOC module in blog posts, and the dependent variables were conversion rate on content offer form submissions and clicks on the CTA inside the TOC module.</p> \n<p>The control condition did not include the new TOC module —control posts either had no table of contents, or a simple bulleted list of anchor links within the body of the post near the top of the article (pictured below).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cVNqdOuWN_4G96kpE7W5pyjhWr8-zIh5iRjIDH7wDh6pOXXarbPbxzuzm6fQyubShTcuQzmLjFhy3-eclMEj-aKIfcfp3_Sj_SA8hNXoXIQt2NW29tIIDhy3QLV9NPS2eZhdcJHS\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant A of the hubspot blog chapter module AB test\"></p> \n<p>In variant B, the new TOC module was added to blog posts. This module was sticky, meaning it remained onscreen as users scrolled down the page. Variant B also included a content offer CTA at the bottom of the module.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/s8XFuXNaFnWSuzevJwaFUyPyJtkSnUs93qMYZU9RHUnK0u3h9vVdFlXti1_rAVZTU1hFYK14P9iUR2AfSgXGXKH-4aDe_r5D4fDC3K8dUcWmmBLBhfAJWN0QPza1DlUS1qHvvZJZ\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant B of the hubspot blog chapter module AB test\"></p> \n<p>Variant C included an identical module to variant B but with the CTA removed.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4HFWXYjCae6K8X-R4Q0nbPMbe_OI5m5-gNna6UISmZVQRoKQnFvXU5_rruzPmpCoKHgdYhunW_WVrUKqpzfQTGgJqSjz1UyAWHBGWxvwHtcwsxIcrEQx9V2nCvZufSTZ96LK4mXR\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant C of the hubspot blog chapter module AB test\"></p> \n<p>Both variants B and C did not increase the conversion rate on blog posts. The control condition outperformed variant B by 7% and performed equally with variant C. Also, few users interacted with the new TOC module or the CTA inside the module.</p> \n<h3>5. Review Notifications</h3> \n<p>To determine the best way of gathering customer reviews, we ran a split test of email notifications versus in-app notifications. Here, the independent variable was the type of notification and the dependent variable was the percentage of those who left a review out of all those who opened the notification.</p> \n<p>In the control, HubSpot sent a plain text email notification asking users to leave a review. In variant B, HubSpot sent an email with a certificate image including the user’s name.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1uBsYglIwFmXp-L0b_zQsSq5-lTYVSnN1B0-ewKYiRz9uZrXttvE8h38jEOFl9Q0GDD7s3x60WUknh7BxJEPMGIRuTCk7sMrPshNnxzyEkP935SLHiWrJrhNUPDh5Bf6JKu4kmMf\" width=\"500\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" alt=\"variant B of the hubspot notification AB test\"></p> \n<p>For variant C, HubSpot sent users an in app-notification.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Uaesq2m_BCCmf8leXIo30qCSQcQ7-8aadq4wtiyYUw73FG31jU1oD36OD52zDcLdRqbzpK_JovaJTKZYfvfbKdthSwnY8DEICqnUMSwayGKMFX0VsRddFnKexXHPYvahohwIa_HU\" width=\"500\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" alt=\"variant C of the hubspot notification AB test\"></p> \n<p>Ultimately, both emails performed similarly and outperformed the in-app notifications. About 25% of users who opened an email left a review versus the 10.3% who opened in-app notifications. Emails were also more often opened by users.</p> \n<h2>Start A/B Testing Today</h2> \n<p>A/B testing allows you to get to the truth of what content and marketing your audience wants to see.

covered. Below, we’re covering the top reasons why brands lose followers on Instagram and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gain-instagram-followers\">how to regain them</a>.</p> \n<h2>Why am I losing so many followers on Instagram?</h2> \n<h3>1. You’re not posting often enough or posting too much.</h3> \n<p>When <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-social-media-marketing-report\">we surveyed Instagram marketers</a>, 40% said that not posting enough is the number one reason why brands lose followers.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, 33% said posting too much can have the same impact.</p> \n<p>When it comes to posting, it’s all about striking the right balance. You want to post enough to make sure you’re reaching your target audience and not disappearing in a sea of posts.</p> \n<p>However, you don’t want to post too much that your audience is getting flooded with your posts all over their timeline.</p> \n<p>Here are a few guidelines: First, post at least once a day on the platform – whether it’s on Instagram Stories, Reels, or in-feed. If you have to choose, Stories is probably the best option as marketers surveyed say it’s the second-best way to gain followers behind going live.</p> \n<p>Second, share an in-feed post two to three times a week. You can increase this cadence based on how your audience responds but you probably shouldn’t lower it.</p> \n<h3>2. You’re being too sales-y.</h3> \n<p>The second most popular reason why your brand is losing followers is that your content is too focused on selling, according to 39% of Instagram marketers surveyed.</p> \n<p>Our survey found that content centered around a brand’s products/services is leveraged by 39% of IG marketers and has the second-highest ROI.</p> \n<p>However, if it’s the only type of content you post, you might alienate your audience.</p> \n<p>Again, balance is the keyword here.</p> \n<p>In addition to posts that highlight your products and/or services, you should also post content that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Reflects your brand values.</li> \n <li>Invites conversation.</li> \n <li>Builds community.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Another effective content strategy? Make your audience laugh.</p> \n<p>Our survey revealed that funny content is the most effective for getting followers, shares, and engagement on Instagram.</p> \n<h3>3. You had bot followers.</h3> \n<p>If you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buy-instagram-followers\">purchased bot followers</a>, you’ll be in for a rude awakening when they all disappear and your follower list tanks.</p> \n<p>39% of Instagram marketers surveyed say this is the third most popular reason why brands lose followers.</p> \n<p>While it’s tempting to buy bots to give the semblance of a strong follower base, this practice will only hurt you in the long run.</p> \n<p>Instead, focus on building a follower list organically through a consistent posting schedule, sharing valuable content, following trends, and listening to your data.</p> \n<p>It doesn’t have to take long either. Only 1% of marketers we surveyed say it took over a year to grow their followers by 1K. Most marketers (65%) said it took anywhere from one to six months.</p> \n<p>And 13% actually did it in less than a month.</p> \n<p>This is all to say that see this loss in followers as an opportunity to rebuild your Instagram page and get more reliable data on your audience.</p> \n<div>\n <iframe style=\"border: none; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://listen.hubspot.com/embed/v2/smallPlayer/d40176e3\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>  \n</div> \n<h3>4. You don’t have a consistent aesthetic and voice.</h3> \n<p>One thing audiences love is consistency.</p> \n<p>Consistency in your branding and your creative assets is key in building strong brand recognition. In addition, consistency also helps build a visually appealing profile.</p> \n<p>If a user visits your profile and every post looks like it was created by a different brand, they’ll have a hard time understanding what your brand is all about and choose to unfollow you.</p> \n<p>Personally, if I’m scrolling and I notice a brand I don’t recognize on my timeline, I’ll visit their profile and if I don’t recognize their last few posts, I’ll likely unfollow them. I imagine many users behave the same way.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, figure out what your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">brand identity </a>and visual aesthetic are early on in your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\">branding</a> process.</p> \n<p>From there, you can leverage tools like Canva to build a visual profile that stays consistent across all platforms.</p> \n<h3>5. Your audience has evolved and you’re not keeping up.</h3> \n<p>It would be so easy to market to our audiences if their interests and behaviors always stayed the same.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, that isn’t the case.</p> \n<p>This requires marketers to stay on top of what attracts and retains their audiences. One of the most effective ways to do this is by relying on your data. What is it telling you?</p> \n<p>Say you’re HubSpot and our feed consists of customer success stories, product highlights, company values, and industry trends.</p> \n<p>Perhaps content surrounding industry trends used to perform very well but you’ve noticed a slow decline over the past six months. Perhaps your audience is not as interested in this content or the format in which it’s being presented.</p> \n<p>Maybe if you used to leverage images, you should consider switching to video.</p> \n<p>Your Instagram strategy should be steered by what your data is telling you. If you don’t use it, you will quickly lose touch with your audience and slowly see your follower list decrease.</p> \n<p>Losing Instagram followers can be a scary reality to face. However, once you identify the reason behind the decline, you can address it and regain them.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Improve your website with effective technical SEO.

If your connection is slow and unreliable, the comment section may not load properly.</p> \n<p>Another reason why your comments may not load is if you’re using a different viewport. While on the web app, YouTube comments load automatically when you scroll, on the mobile app, you must tap to see the comments section.</p> \n<p>Lastly, certain browser extensions may affect how elements load on a page. As such, test disabling your browser extensions if your comments are not loading.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-comments&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png","linkMd5":"8dec63935373aa20326f6fd8d14b1676","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn64@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-875_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","destWidth":625,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6230,"destBytes":9478,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn64@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-875_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments.jpeg?width=250&name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-14-594_ddb7f5d3440e6d42.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-Feb-03-2022-05-25-26-74-AM.jpeg?width=250&name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-Feb-03-2022-05-25-26-74-AM.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn56@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-12-885_e264930de97e9eaa.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-1.jpeg?width=450&name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-1.jpeg":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-3.jpeg?width=450&name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-3.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn86@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-14-984_08d41cd76aecdea5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments.png?width=303&name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn41@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-13-719_734114ce2643e589.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-Feb-03-2022-05-25-26-29-AM.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn12@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-12-147_d0f44e13c195cf95.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-Feb-03-2022-05-25-25-95-AM.jpeg?width=450&name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-Feb-03-2022-05-25-25-95-AM.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-11-698_95814300094cd893.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-4.jpeg?width=450&name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-4.jpeg":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-Feb-03-2022-05-25-26-98-AM.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-22-224_50c458fb9a24f689.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-2.jpeg?width=415&name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-2.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn100@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-11-320_a674e97be00fc99d.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png":null,"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-comments&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-15-325_feaac1224660c825.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705099},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"YouTube vs. Vimeo: Which Video Platform is Best for Your Business?

Read on to see the results, and decide for yourself.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<h3>Number of Users</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">There's no real competition here. YouTube commands an audience of </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/press/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>over two billion monthly users</span></a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> — almost half of the entire internet-using population. Vimeo's </span><a href=\"https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/vimeo-statistics/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>230 million monthly viewers and 1.9 million </span></a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">paid subscribers seem insignificant in contrast. For maximum reach, choose YouTube.</span></p> \n<h3>Search Optimization</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p>YouTube leaves Vimeo in the dust here. YouTube is <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites\">the second largest search engine on the internet</a>, right after parent company Google. If you're planning to create a video tailored to a specific search query, (e.g., <em>how to pick a font for your website</em>), your video belongs on YouTube. Not only will it appear in search results directly on YouTube, but Google also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-steers-users-to-youtube-over-rivals-11594745232\">seems to favor</a> videos from YouTube over those posted on other platforms.</p> \n<h3>Mobile</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/press/\">70% of all YouTube views come from mobile</a>, and the YouTube mobile app is absolutely <a href=\"https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/02/youtube-dominates-all-the-major-apps-takes-away-most-streaming-time-on-smartphones.html\">dominating the mobile streaming space</a> — outranking even formidable competitors like Netflix, Hulu, and Twitch.</p> \n<p>Videos uploaded to Vimeo and YouTube are both optimized automatically for mobile, but YouTube offers more opportunities for mobile discovery and reach.</p> \n<h3>Cost</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p>YouTube is free — even for businesses. But you might be wondering if Vimeo is as well.</p> \n<h4>Is Vimeo free to use?</h4> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Vimeo operates on a tiered pricing model, </span><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/upgrade\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>ranging from a free basic plan to a $75/month package </span></a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">that includes unlimited live streaming.</span></p> \n<h4>Vimeo Pro vs YouTube</h4> \n<p>While Vimeo does have a free basic plan, it limits you to 500MB maximum storage per week.</p> \n<p>If you're okay with paying some money, you can get a Vimeo Pro plan. With Vimeo Pro, you'll have access to support, advanced analytics, and professional privacy.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, you can have unlimited storage for free on YouTube.</p> \n<h3>Support</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>With their paid packages, Vimeo <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/upgrade\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>offers several levels of technical support</span></a> that could be a game-changer for businesses with little video expertise. YouTube offers plenty of <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube?__hstc=20629287.6ac66382cd6445e9a532bf78e26b2936.1629761983054.1644432577944.1644443037198.247&amp;__hssc=20629287.5.1644443037198&amp;__hsfp=2104872287#topic=7505892\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>free help documentation</span></a> and access to a (rather crowded) <a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/?__hstc=20629287.6ac66382cd6445e9a532bf78e26b2936.1629761983054.1644432577944.1644443037198.247&amp;__hssc=20629287.5.1644443037198&amp;__hsfp=2104872287#!forum/youtube\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>support community</span></a>. Still, if you're seeking higher-touch, personalized support on-demand, a paid Vimeo account is the better option.</p> \n<h3>Storage</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p>YouTube offers unlimited, free storage for all accounts, while Vimeo <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/upgrade\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>charges for storage on a tiered basis</span></a>. The basic, free Vimeo account option gives you 500MB of storage per week. With their highest level, $75/month package, you can store 7TB total with no weekly limits.</p> \n<h3>No Pre-Roll Ads</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>If you upload your videos to YouTube, there's a good chance a pre-roll ad will play before it, which has the potential to deter some viewers from sticking around. Vimeo currently doesn't allow ads, and it doesn't look like they'll be changing this policy anytime soon.</p> \n<h3>Running Ad Campaigns</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p>If you're thinking of running your own ads on a video platform, you can't beat YouTube (You also <a href=\"https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224968628-Vimeo-PRO\">can't</a><a href=\"https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224968628-Vimeo-PRO\"> purchase ad space on Vimeo</a>, even if you wanted to, because they don't allow it.)</p> \n<p>YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/\">offers an advanced, user-friendly ads platform</a>, as well as personalized support from a \"YouTube Advertising Expert\" when you spend $10 a day on ads.</p> \n<h3>Community</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>User numbers don't tell the entire story. With such a massive audience on YouTube, the environment is naturally more competitive. It's easier for your video to get drowned out by thousands of others if you aren't planning to feature it somewhere off YouTube. Vimeo's smaller, more community-driven platform might be a better option if you're hoping to tap into an existing creative niche, or get featured on their <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks\">hand-curated staff picks page</a>.</p> \n<h3>Advanced Privacy Options</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>Both YouTube and Vimeo give you the option to set videos to private or public (the default setting on YouTube is public), but Vimeo offers a handful of more nuanced, specific privacy options if that serves your interests. You can add a password protection option to videos, share a video only with people who follow your account, or even hide it from the Vimeo community — which could be useful if you plan on embedding the video on your website and want it to be viewable in only one place.</p> \n<h3>Customizable Player</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>Vimeo's sleek embedded player <a href=\"https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224972808-Customizing-the-embedded-player\">offers a number of useful customization options</a> that YouTube can't match, including hex color customization and the ability to include a custom player logo (on Business and PRO accounts). Plus, when you change the default customization options on your account, all previously embedded videos will update to reflect the changes automatically, with no need to go back and tinker with any code.</p> \n<h3>Analytics</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube </strong></p> \n<p>YouTube takes the win here because <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1714323?hl=en&amp;__hstc=20629287.6ac66382cd6445e9a532bf78e26b2936.1629761983054.1644432577944.1644443037198.247&amp;__hssc=20629287.5.1644443037198&amp;__hsfp=2104872287\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>all their analytics</span></a> — ranging from basic statistics like views to more advanced options — are completely free. Vimeo also offers <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/stats\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>powerful analytics tools</span></a> to evaluate performance, but you'll have to pay to access everything but basic stats.</p> \n<h3>Video Quality</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Winner: Vimeo</p> \n<p>When it comes to video quality, Vimeo beats out YouTube. In a test done by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@GreatUX/vimeo-vs-youtube-video-quality-18e51f83f916\">Medium</a>, Vimeo's video quality was crisp, clean, and easier to read. On the other hand, the same video on YouTube was blurry, making it much harder to follow.</p> \n<h3>Audio Quality</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Winner: Vimeo</p> \n<p>Again, when it comes to quality, Vimeo comes out on top. Sound quality is higher on Vimeo because the platform supports 320Kbps. However, to enjoy higher-quality videos and audio, you'll need to be subscribed to one of the paid plans.</p> \n<h3>Live Streaming</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Winner: YouTube</p> \n<p>Both Vimeo and YouTube have live streaming options, however, YouTube is the clear winner here because it's free. Vimeo offers live streaming with a paid plan. However, with Vimeo, you can upload new versions of the video and keep on using the same URL and upload higher quality recorded versions of a live stream, which you can edit before posting.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported%20sitepage%20images/youtube-vs-vimeo-mini-infographic-market-motive.jpg?width=790&amp;name=youtube-vs-vimeo-mini-infographic-market-motive.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube vs. Vimeo infographic\" width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.marketmotive.com/blog/online-marketing/vimeo-vs-youtube-which-should-you-be-using\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<h3>So which one should you choose?</h3> \n<p>It depends on what exactly you want to accomplish with your videos. If you're looking for a creative community where you can connect with other video creators and gain some exposure in a specific niche, Vimeo is a better place to start sharing your content. If you have business goals that revolve heavily around search optimization and ads, YouTube is your best bet.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-vs-vimeo&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png","linkMd5":"be7dafc5977404caa82c10b938b1410d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn64@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-875_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","destWidth":625,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6230,"destBytes":9478,"author":"kcook@hubspot.com (Karla Hesterberg)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn64@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-875_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported%20sitepage%20images/youtube-vs-vimeo-mini-infographic-market-motive.jpg?width=790&name=youtube-vs-vimeo-mini-infographic-market-motive.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn56@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-12-999_5c49f26b5a0d36be.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png":null,"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-vs-vimeo&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn76@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-13-353_4ad67a02c3a430ec.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705115},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"Mastering Facebook Ads In 2022 Through Incrementality","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-ads-incrementality","description":"<p>There are many resources out there telling you how to optimize your Facebook ads to scale your business's growth. And while I'm sure they can help in some aspects, you're probably optimizing your campaigns based on the wrong metrics.</p> \n<p>In 2022, Facebook has <a href=\"https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/\">1.79 billion daily users</a>. There are plenty of opportunities to create Facebook ads that will drive impressions, link clicks, leads, and more. However, these metrics only scratch the surface of how much impact your Facebook ads can truly have on your business.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Sign Up for HubSpot Academy's Free Facebook Ads Training Course\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>As more industry experts focus their media buying on incremental gains, marketers can better measure their Facebook ads' positive, negative, or neutral impact on their business.</p> \n<h2>What is incrementality in Facebook Ads?</h2> \n<p>Incrementality allows marketers to understand how Facebook ads impact their business. Often, advertisers make optimizations to campaigns based on certain metrics, which can dramatically affect the end goal.</p> \n<p>It's crucial for businesses to identify what's working and what isn't — especially since Facebook's ad revenue worldwide was <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277963/facebooks-quarterly-global-revenue-by-segment/\"><strong>$84.2 billion</strong> in 2020</a>. Whether you have a large or small Facebook advertising budget, you want to make sure it's generating results.</p> \n<p>Advertisers can measure incrementality by using control tests and comparing the results from those exposed to an ad versus those who have not. Once the tests have been completed, the results can help your business make smarter decisions on your Facebook ads and optimize your campaigns accordingly.</p> \n<h2>Why should marketers track incremental return on ad spend (iROAS)?</h2> \n<p>One minute you're a marketer, and the next, you're a data analyst. All jokes aside, information overload is very real in 2022. With all of this data available, there’s the assumption that it should be easy for marketers to pinpoint the best audience to target, understand what point they are at in the Facebook sales funnel, and the best methods to convert them.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Sales-Funnel.png?width=1104&amp;name=Facebook-Sales-Funnel.png\" alt=\"Facebook Sales Funnel\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<p>However, data dumps and compiling all of this information is incredibly time-consuming. And as digital marketing continues to expand, time is not always on our side. Businesses need to refocus their efforts from heavy reliance on data collection to doubling down on finding the <em>right</em> data—that can assist in smart optimizations and <a href=\"https://vistasocial.com/social-media-analytics/\">actionable insights</a> to fuel your Facebook campaign's bottom line.</p> \n<h2>How to Calculate Incremental Return on Ad Spend</h2> \n<p>The method for calculating iROAS is different for every publisher. The most methodical approach is by applying a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1915029282150425\">holdout</a> to your Facebook campaign. The holdout on your campaign will act as a control group for Facebook users that will not see your ads. The remaining group of users will be the test audience for your Facebook campaign.</p> \n<p>After the test is complete, marketers can compare the results from the test group to the control group. The difference in the results will be your conversion lift, representing the incremental impacts on your conversions.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ROAS-Formula.png?width=760&amp;name=ROAS-Formula.png\" alt=\"How to calculate return on ad spend ROAS\" width=\"760\" style=\"width: 760px;\">iROAS is calculated similarly to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/return-on-ad-spend?_ga=2.189840235.1519769113.1645056446-1004475094.1645056446\">ROAS</a>, which is revenue divided by cost. However, this measurement allows your business to understand which Facebook campaigns are working and which aren't. The calculation for iROAS is Incremental Revenue / Ad Spend = iROAS.</p> \n<p>In the YouTube video below, HubSpot details how to determine ad spend by understanding the bidding system used by ad networks.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtwEBXoMa80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h2>3 Simple Ways to Increase Your Facebook's Ads Incrementality in 2022</h2> \n<p>Frequently data dumps fail due to the sheer amount of information available. Marketers may find many valid insights, but the delivery of this information can get lost in translation — especially if there is no clear direction. Brands looking to increase their Facebook ads incrementality should work with a <a href=\"https://agencyvista.com/\">leading marketing agency</a> with proven experience.</p> \n<p>However, if you're looking to get started on your own, below we'll walk you through the top three ways to increase your Facebook ad's incrementality to exceed your 2022 growth goals.</p> \n<h3>1. Audience Targeting</h3> \n<p>Facebook users at the top of the funnel versus the bottom will yield very different incrementality results. For example, you will see very different results if you're using a 5% lookalike audience of customers who purchased in the last month vs. remarketing to customers who purchased in the last few years.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Ad-Targeting.jpg?width=1600&amp;name=Facebook-Ad-Targeting.jpg\" alt=\"Creating audience for Facebook Ad targeting\" width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px;\">Targeting new customers should be your most incremental audience segment since they would not have converted and made the purchase had it not been for your Facebook ad.</p> \n<p>This can also affect your bid strategies and budgets for remarketing audiences. For example, a customer who has purchased from you recently may not need a Facebook ad to prompt another purchase — this will depend on your product or service buying situation.</p> \n<h4><strong>Three Class of Buying Situations:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Routine decision-making: </strong>involves purchases that require very little thought after the original decision has been made. Such as gum, a chocolate bar, or a soft drink.</li> \n <li><strong>Limited decision-making: </strong>involves purchasing products that require a moderate amount of time and effort to compare models and brands before making a choice. This could be comparing which phone you are planning to upgrade to.</li> \n <li><strong>Extensive decision-making: </strong>involves an extensive consumer decision regarding whether or not to purchase a product. Examples include cars, homes, and education.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Ad Creative</h3> \n<p>I'm sure every marketer has heard about the study that found that the average attention span has decreased from 12 seconds to 8 seconds—while a goldfish holds a 9-second attention span. There is so much noise and clutter on social media that often, consumers will scroll right past your ad.</p> \n<p>Advertisers need to create Facebook ads that grab the viewers' attention and drive action. Facebook ad creative is one of the top ways to increase your incrementality.</p> \n<p>Learn from the best! We've collected the 50 best Facebook ads to inspire your next campaign. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-ad-examples?hubs_post-cta=body&amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-facebook-ad-types&amp;_ga=2.189840235.1519769113.1645056446-1004475094.1645056446\">Check out this exclusive lookbook</a> to get a head start on crafting the perfect ad to drive incremental revenue.</p> \n<h3>3. Facebook Placements</h3> \n<p>There are several placements for advertisers across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Audience Network. But, not every placement works with every type of campaign.</p> \n<p>For example, an ad on audience network may spark brand awareness or interest but not drive an immediate conversion. The same goes for device targeting, often people are in discovery mode on mobile but complete the transaction on desktop.</p> \n<p>Most advertisers still recommend combining placements to maximize the results, but it is beneficial to understand where your most incremental audience is.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4f0eef09-2c33-43c7-9dee-7dde3ae4071e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4f0eef09-2c33-43c7-9dee-7dde3ae4071e.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffacebook-ads-incrementality&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08.png","linkMd5":"d5938863511e5e5025f9df1f42d22700","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn76@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-05-700_34bd683f552faea2.webp","destWidth":611,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7061,"destBytes":9908,"author":"Brittany Garlin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn76@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-05-700_34bd683f552faea2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Sales-Funnel.png?width=1104&name=Facebook-Sales-Funnel.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn38@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-09-908_23fed7923acc4d96.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ROAS-Formula.png?width=760&name=ROAS-Formula.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn75@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-09-756_b18e309465d1b081.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Ad-Targeting.jpg?width=1600&name=Facebook-Ad-Targeting.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn94@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-15-332_a7027f0933833d23.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4f0eef09-2c33-43c7-9dee-7dde3ae4071e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn64@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-11-201_abc294f6e8ab83dc.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffacebook-ads-incrementality&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-11-646_f01ad25c68735200.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705114},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"Everything You Need to Know About Marketing Operations in One Place","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-operations","description":"<p>One of my favorite movies is \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Rock\">School of Rock</a>,\" which also happens to be one of 2003's best films.

After all, without marketing operations, it would be tough for marketing teams to complete essential activities effectively because they enable other marketing departments to bring cohesion to campaigns and processes.</p> \n<p>For example, as technology is necessary to carry out most marketing tasks, a team to manage the complexity of that technology and ensure it works as it should is also necessary — <em>which is exactly what MOps is</em>.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of situations that can be rectified by having a marketing operations team:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Problem</td> \n   <td>MOps Solution</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Your investments in marketing technology don’t provide the solutions you thought they would.</td> \n   <td>MOps ensure that teams are enabled by technology solutions and eliminate tech debt.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>You want to streamline data reporting and metrics tracking to understand ROI.</td> \n   <td>MOps focus on processes and systems for data reporting to enable teams.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Strategy execution is a timely process, and you want to lower the amount of time it takes from start to finish.</td> \n   <td>MOps helps team improve processes to become more efficient.</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>At HubSpot, the marketing ops team is responsible for supporting the systems and processes that enable the marketing team to perform optimally in their roles. This includes everything from permissions, conversational marketing, user data, forms, and email operations.</p> \n<p>An essential function of how well a marketing ops team works is proper management.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>As a point of reference, marketing operations is the process of strategizing and optimizing, while marketing ops management defines how that strategizing and optimizing will happen.</p> \n<p>Since marketing operations management aims to increase efficiency, ops teams often have a hand in content planning and campaign analysis.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Role of Marketing Operations</h3> \n<p>Marketing operations is a combination of different processes that contribute to marketing team success. The role of marketing ops encompasses:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Project management</li> \n <li>Strategic planning</li> \n <li>Organization benchmarking</li> \n <li>Workflow process development and documentation</li> \n <li>Customer, market, and competitive intelligence research</li> \n <li>Performance measurement</li> \n <li>Campaign analysis and reporting</li> \n <li>Data management</li> \n <li>Process development and implementation</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Much of the role of marketing operations comes down to strategic decision making for key <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-strategy-guide\">marketing strategies</a>, and seeing those projects through to completion based on analyzed data.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Operations Strategy</h2> \n<p>Marketing ops team members need to have an expansive skillset. Some of the typical activities this department deals with are email operations, systems analysis, customer data and marketing, user operations, and lead rotation.</p> \n<p>All of these roles come together to align the process and platforms needed to carry out marketing tasks for the greater marketing team.</p> \n<p>When thinking about a marketing ops strategy, consider the problems the marketing ops team needs to solve, taking into account the needs of customers, stakeholders, and the employees of your company.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Identify what you want your operations strategy to accomplish for stakeholders.</h3> \n<p>Firstly, you need to effectively communicate and involve your stakeholder(s) when trying to create your marketing operations strategy. By doing so, you can better align the team and work toward solving high-level needs and priorities that may not be explicitly clear beforehand.</p> \n<p>This is where the importance of internal <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34212/how-to-create-a-service-level-agreement-sla-for-better-sales-marketing-alignment.aspx\">service level agreements (SLAs)</a> come in. These contracts establish a set of deliverables to another party that sets clear expectations and mitigates issues that may arise.</p> \n<p>For instance, key stakeholders might want to make email marketing a more valuable process. The marketing ops team would then be responsible for the processes and systems that support this endeavor, ensuring that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The organization has effective email marketing technology</li> \n <li>The marketing team is enabled to send emails and create improved content offers</li> \n <li>The sales team is enabled and empowered to source quality leads</li> \n <li>All parties have what they need and are communicating effectively during each step of the process</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Figure out a measurable metric to determine the success of your strategy.</h3> \n<p>The next step in strategizing is to identify how the team would <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-success-metrics\">measure the success</a> of the project. When you figure out a measurable metric, you'll be able to keep track of the strategy's success as your team works through the plan. The metric will remind your team of the goal you want to accomplish and what stakeholders want to see as a result of your plan.</p> \n<p>In this example, the team might conclude, \"Click-through rate and total number of clicks are how we want to measure the value that email marketing brings to the business. We will calculate the click-through rate by dividing the number of clicks in a month by the number of unique email recipient impressions in a month and multiply it by 100 for the percentage.\"</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Define your goal(s) using the SMART format.</h3> \n<p>With your metrics identified, the next step in defining a marketing ops strategy is outlining significant <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template\">SMART goals</a>. This format is important because it gives your team a better sense of direction and organization in strategy execution.</p> \n<p>An example of an effective SMART goal is, “We will increase total clicks from email by 25% in one year.” because it’s:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Specific</strong>: It’s not a broad goal; it’s focused on email marketing.</li> \n <li><strong>Measurable</strong>: It can be measured by a concrete metric (total clicks).</li> \n <li><strong>Attainable</strong>: It’s possible to see this level of change in the business.</li> \n <li><strong>Realistic</strong>: The team is capable of working toward 25% of improvement.</li> \n <li><strong>Time-bound</strong>: This goal has a set duration of one year.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. If needed, communicate how colleagues can take part in refining your strategy.</h3> \n<p>With the goal and metrics identified, your next step is to outline what this change would mean for affected colleagues, such as the team members who create and distribute email marketing messages.</p> \n<p>The team might conclude that \"Marketers can expect an easier email guideline process, a more effective format, and to receive a form to offer input about how to make that happen.\"</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Determine actionable steps in your plan that will help you reach your goals.</h3> \n<p>Determining actionable steps will help your marketing ops team figure out what needs to be done, identify the resources required to see success, and stay organized as they work through their tasks.</p> \n<p>A marketing ops professional will need to run these steps by the stakeholders who actually influence the plan. For instance, they would be communicating steps to reach the previously stated SMART goal like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Switching to a more efficient email technology provider.</li> \n <li>Ensuring that the data being used to measure these goals is clean and accurate.</li> \n <li>Enabling the marketing team to source more quality leads.</li> \n <li>Enabling the sales team with better templates or sales enablement resources.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>With these steps communicated, stakeholders can provide assistance or suggestions where it’s needed, and the marketing ops team can get closer to execution.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. Assign team members to specific tasks that will contribute to the completion of your goals.</h3> \n<p>Having that set in place, what's next for the marketing ops team is to assign team members specific tasks to help them achieve their goals. For instance, one team member might be in charge of redefining email marketing contact lists. Another might be in charge of auditing the current workflows in place for email marketing.</p> \n<p>As team members complete these tasks, they would check them off in a centralized space so the entire team can stay updated on the project’s status.</p> \n<p>Marketing operations teams are equally effective with their strategies and management capabilities as Summer's character in \"School of Rock.\" With her processes, the group was able to obtain their own rehearsal space and offer music classes.</p> \n<h2>Align and Optimize Your Marketing Operations</h2> \n<p>Marketing ops can come up with ways to increase customer satisfaction and ease the job of marketers. Their strategies make marketing activities and duties accessible to all, and because of that, are an essential part of a business.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=2f598dfb-38e3-4e7b-a962-57cf6aebd7d7&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2f598dfb-38e3-4e7b-a962-57cf6aebd7d7.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-operations&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/34155d81-37a6-4910-a596-3a77b9e5a99f.png","linkMd5":"0aa7014dbe6c5f0e4050c8dfa3994b13","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-697_d4993499845f294a.webp","destWidth":492,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5749,"destBytes":7772,"author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/34155d81-37a6-4910-a596-3a77b9e5a99f.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-697_d4993499845f294a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Marketing%20Operations%20in%20One%20Place.png?width=624&height=624&name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Marketing%20Operations%20in%20One%20Place.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-09-605_dce62d7bc9c727c2.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2f598dfb-38e3-4e7b-a962-57cf6aebd7d7.png":null,"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-operations&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705115},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"What is a Media Mix & The Most Effective Types [HubSpot Blog Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-mix","description":"<p>I’m willing to bet that today, the typical campaign at any brand uses a media mix.</p>  \n<p>This refers to the process of using multiple channels to meet marketing goals.

Ultimately, media mix optimization is the process of analyzing the performance of those channels.</p> \n<p>Think about the last campaign you saw from one of your favorite brands. What did they do differently that really clicked with you? By incorporating a media mix into your yearly planning, you can narrow down what resonates with your audience.</p> \n<h2>Media Mix Example</h2> \n<p>To see how a media mix works for a campaign, let’s use makeup brand <a href=\"https://thelipbar.com/\">The Lip Bar</a>’s latest campaign: \"Something BAWSE is coming.\"</p> \n<p>To build anticipation around its latest product launch and celebrate its 10-year company anniversary, The Lip Bar launched a multi-channel campaign that reached audiences both online and offline.</p> \n<p>First up, website.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"media mix example showing makeup brand's campaign on their website\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D-1.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D-1.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://thelipbar.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>When you land on the brand’s homepage, you’ll see an image of the CEO with the following sentence \"Shark Tank said no, 12,000 5-star reviews later, 100% that bawse.\"</p> \n<p>Upon clicking on the image, you’ll arrive at a landing page that has a timeline of the brand. From launching in 2012, to opening its flagship store in 2019, then expanding to 1500+ stores in 2021. Once you get to 2022, you see the tagline \"Something Bawse is Coming.\"</p> \n<p>As you continue scrolling, you reach a section that offers a launch date and time for the brand’s newest product.</p> \n<p>The second digital channel the brand leveraged for this campaign is YouTube, publishing a 45-second video showing the CEO’s journey over the last 10 years.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 853px; max-height: 480px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.27%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BfxeqsaYLE\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Moving offline, the brand also published billboards in five cities to continue the campaign.</p> \n<p>Note how the billboard didn’t use the tagline we saw on social media platforms.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"media mix example showing makeup brand's billboard campaign\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZwiA_ILpBj/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The benefit of using a media mix is to leverage different strategies to see which tactics work and lead to better conversions.</p> \n<p>The Lip Bar’s latest campaign is a great example of how any brand can leverage channels differently to reach the same marketing goal.</p> \n<h2>Media Mix Stats in 2022</h2> \n<p>In January 2022, we surveyed over 600 <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning\">media planners</a> to discover their strategies, goals, and challenges. Here are some interesting findings:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>84% of media planners surveyed leverage a mix of organic and paid media.</li> \n <li>Email marketing is the most leveraged media channel, used by 1 in 2 media planners.</li> \n <li>41% of media planners surveyed will change their media mix in 2022, while 45% will keep it the same.</li> \n <li>14% of media planners currently leverage non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while 16% plan to use them for the first time in 2022.</li> \n <li>39% of those who use NFTs in their media planning say they have the best ROI of any channel in their media mix.</li> \n <li>39% of marketers surveyed say determining the most effective media mix is the biggest challenge of media planning.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Media Mix Optimization</h2> \n<p>Media mix optimization provides businesses with an understanding of how their messages are coming across to customers. It allows a brand to invest more time and money into marketing strategies that are best suited for their audiences.</p> \n<p>Marketers might consider optimizing their media mix if they want to gain some helpful insight into what time and capital is needed to target their audience in a way that gives customers a personalized experience.</p> \n<p>But, while media mix optimization is a powerful opportunity for methodizing data collection online, it's not the best strategy for marketers who employ a lot of traditional marketing techniques, since you can't really measure the success of a billboard or newspaper ad.</p> \n<p>However, to make guided decisions such as what font to use in creative design, when to publish social media posts on various channels, or where to invest resources, this method can be helpful.</p> \n<p>Optimizing a media mix means looking at the analytics and ROI of various marketing strategies. This can be anything from engagement data of social media platforms to views on the newest commercial.</p> \n<p>That's where media mix modeling comes in. If media mix optimization is the \"what,\" modeling is the \"how.\" Every model can (and should) look different, depending on your marketing and broader business goal.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Media mix models can be used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say a business has a question like, \"How did paying for a sponsored tweet affect overall blog traffic?\" The business's media mix model should then accurately depict how a dependent variable – like overall blog traffic – relates to an independent variable, such as investing in Twitter.</p> \n<p>For businesses still deciding if a media mix optimization is a good idea for them, we've put together key tips to guide you when creating a media mix model. Let's explore those, next.</p> \n<h2>Tips for Optimizing Your Media Mix</h2> \n<h3>1. Collect personal level data.</h3> \n<p>The goal here is to find and focus on analytics that will help provide an accurate picture of how customers engage with your media mix.</p> \n<p>Analytics software is expansive and offers an array of tools for use. If you're in the market for one, the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">HubSpot Marketing Hub</a> is a great place to go.</p> \n<p>Having too many metrics can be confusing and lead to inaccurate data. The best plan is to have an idea of which metrics need to be tracked so they can be right at the beginning.</p> \n<p>A normal media mix optimization process can take anywhere from a few months to a year. So, collecting the right information at the beginning contributes to getting the most accurate information overall.</p> \n<h3>2. Have a robust reporting process.</h3> \n<p>When using a media mix, you often combine online and offline strategies. With this in mind, it can be more difficult to measure the impact of a billboard compared to a paid social ad.</p> \n<p>That means you’ll have to think outside of the box when evaluating your media mix. For instance, while an online ad will have clear conversion rates you can find, a billboard may require some creative tracking.</p> \n<p>Perhaps, you can track the uptick in branded search volume or improved brand recall.</p> \n<p>This requires having a robust reporting process that accounts for the events you’ll be tracking – both online and offline.</p> \n<h3>3. Choose the right platform.</h3> \n<p>Marketing teams that use CMS or analytics software are already ahead of the game. Software like this is essential to optimizing a media mix because it can give you numbers that would otherwise take some time to figure out manually.</p> \n<p>A brand can analyze its media mix with the use of platforms that collect engagement data in real-time and compile that data into tracking reports.</p> \n<p>Look for a platform that can give a holistic view of results across the board, so results will maintain consistency. It's also good to choose software that specializes in the marketing channels being used at the time.</p> \n<p>Because optimizing is measuring a lot of different data at once, stick to as few systems as possible.</p> \n<p>For businesses that are in the market for a CMS,<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/content-management-system?_ga=2.32061246.1093091538.1581343599-940436819.1565181751\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/content-management-system?_ga=2.32061246.1093091538.1581343599-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot offers tools</a> that are easy to use for brands of any size.</p> \n<h3>4. Analyze the data.</h3> \n<p>We've been talking a lot about the kind of data and analyzing that needs to be done in a media mix optimization, but another important factor is being able to interpret and understand that data.</p> \n<p>It's no secret that in the marketing world, there is an abundance of processes and acronyms floating around. While first getting into the groove of understanding them and what they mean can be intimidating, it's important to know the data being collected and how to use it to your advantage.</p> \n<p>For instance, if a marketing team had especially high click-to-open rates for weekly newsletters, that's useful information to infer that the next campaign could benefit greatly from an email-marketing rollout. Alternatively, if a marketing team has no idea what a click-to-open rate is, those numbers aren't going to be helpful — just a little confusing.</p> \n<p>Reading data to understand its usefulness is just as important as collecting it.</p> \n<h3>5. Consider public perception.</h3> \n<p>Knowing how the public perceives your brand can help fill in some interpretation gaps during the modeling process. In the media mix model, think about how to fit in customer opinion. That way, the numbers will have some customer opinions to define them.</p> \n<p>There are a couple of ways to do this.</p> \n<p>To better understand your brand perception, monitor your brand mentions on social media. Take note of the positives, the negatives, and the questions. You can also create a survey to know how your customers feel about your company and its services and use a net promoter score.</p> \n<p>An NPS asks customers how likely they are to recommend a business to a friend. Knowing this will aid in figuring out how a business fares among the competition in the market. It will also assist in future marketing endeavors.</p> \n<p>For instance, if customers fill out your survey and ask for more personalized Instagram stories, your team could take that knowledge and include it in your next campaign.</p> \n<p>This method ultimately gives the media mix optimization reigns to the customer.</p> \n<p>Media mix optimization can help your marketing team figure out which distribution channels will best promote an upcoming campaign, and can ultimately help strengthen your marketing strategy as a whole.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in Feb. 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness. </em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Blog - Content Mapping Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmedia-mix&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png","linkMd5":"561d994faf8c508bd2e5132b41ce2364","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-896_f8c910eb1e0201f6.webp","destWidth":483,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4217,"destBytes":7328,"author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-896_f8c910eb1e0201f6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D-1.jpeg?width=600&name=What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D-1.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn6@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-11-092_f224b3a7c8b4a7c9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D.jpeg?width=600&name=What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn2@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-15-518_9d0ddf4316cdfe18.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn24@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-12-685_d198dce450120884.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmedia-mix&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-14-644_e7ff58d00b36a57b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705033},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"How Market Intelligence Will Make Your Marketing Team More Agile","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-intelligence","description":"<p>When I was younger, my dream was to open a cheese store with my family.

For companies that prioritize intelligence data, decision-making can be <a href=\"https://techjury.net/blog/business-intelligence-statistics/#gref\">five times faster</a>.</p> \n<p>Feeling hesitant to rely on intelligence data? <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020\">Gartner reports</a> over one-third of organizations will rely on decision intelligence by 2023, making data intelligence a must for remaining competitive.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review what market intelligence is, how it's different from market research, and the intel tools that can facilitate the process.</p> \n<p>Market intelligence is used to learn about the existing market, customers, problems, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-intelligence-competitive-advantage\">competition</a>, and growth potential. Businesses can gather this information through internal and external sources such as sales logs, surveys, social media, news websites, manufacturers, clients, or distributors.</p> \n<p>For instance, companies can gather general demographics and spending habits of their consumers to write better, more targeted <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing?_ga=2.89808924.622785003.1614973949-456434430.1614973949\">social media ads</a>. Additionally, market intelligence can help a company make decisions on product development and establish a stronger brand.</p> \n<h2>How to Gather Market Intelligence</h2> \n<p>So, what type of information should you collect? Generally, market intelligence can be divided into four main categories of information:</p> \n<h3>Competitor Intelligence</h3> \n<p>This is the process of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-intelligence-competitive-advantage\">learning more about your competitors</a>. To do this, you might conduct a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/swot-analysis\">SWOT analysis</a>, so you can look at the competition's strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to uncover why customers would choose competitors over your product or service.</p> \n<h3>Product Intelligence</h3> \n<p>Once you've analyzed how you compare to your competitors, look inward at your own product or service. The goal is to learn about its quality and performance and identify opportunities for improvement.</p> \n<p>If you have a physical product, you should also analyze your manufacturing process. Are you building your product in the most efficient way? This information should help you improve the user experience and improve your product.</p> \n<h3>Market Understanding</h3> \n<p>To truly understand how your product is performing, you'll have to look at the various markets where it's available. Could you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-development-strategy\">expand your product </a>to other markets? Are there other markets that could benefit from your product or service?</p> \n<p>Ultimately, this information should help you understand where your audience is and what gaps exist, so you can fill them.</p> \n<h3>Customer Understanding</h3> \n<p>Understanding your customer helps to increase your product or service life cycle. That's because it's usually more expensive to gain a new customer than to keep an existing one.<a href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/\"></a></p> \n<p>For this reason — and many others — you have to know your audience. Why do your customers buy from you? What challenges do you help them resolve? The goal here is to gather the information that can help your marketing team come up with targeted campaigns.</p> \n<p>Overall, gathering market intelligence should answer questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Where should we devote more resources?</li> \n <li>What markets can we enter next?</li> \n <li>What are our customers purchasing patterns?</li> \n <li>What audiences should we market to?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, you might be wondering, <em>\"How do I gather this information?\"</em></p> \n<p>To conduct market intelligence, you'll use internal and external sources of data, such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Surveys</li> \n <li>Polls</li> \n <li>Forms</li> \n <li>Focus groups</li> \n <li>Interviews</li> \n <li>Observation</li> \n <li>A/B tests</li> \n <li>Competitor tracking analytics</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Depending on the analytics you have available, a lot of this information can be found on your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7969/what-is-a-cms-and-why-should-you-care.aspx\">content management system </a>(CMS) or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-use-crm\">customer relationship management </a>(CRM).</p> \n<p>However, before we jump into the software you can use to find this information, I know you're probably thinking, <em>\"How is this different from market research?\" </em>Let's dive into that below.</p> \n<p>Alternatively to market intelligence, market research focuses on learning more about the buyer's research process and what influences their buying decisions.</p> \n<h2>Example of Market Intelligence</h2> \n<p>Let’s walk through an example of how a fictional company could use market intelligence to create a competitive advantage.</p> \n<p>JKL Podcasting Co offers online software podcasters can use to record, edit, and distribute their podcast to major streaming platforms. As marketers at JKL look to expand the company’s user base, they performed an in-depth analysis of the market for podcast recording software.</p> \n<p>In this analysis, they covered four areas:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Competitor landscape — They identified the top-ranking podcast recording software companies to understand their product features, pricing model, sales funnel, marketing tactics, and customer demographics.</li> \n <li>Product — After gathering competitor information, they worked with their product team to gain a deep understanding of their own product including key features, how it was like competitor products, and what differentiated it from competitor products. They also learned about up-and-coming features launching later in the year.</li> \n <li>Market analysis — Next, the team did research to understand the overall valuation and growth potential of the podcast recording software market. They learned podcast listenership has <a href=\"https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/the-podcast-industry-report-statistics/\"><span>grown over the past decade</span></a> and is expected to grow more in coming years, which could lead to more podcasts being produced. With seeing growth and investment in the podcasting space, along with increased interest in people wanting to start podcasts, marketers at JKL learn there is a potential market for new, or up-and-coming podcasters who want easy-to-use software.</li> \n <li>Customer base — Finally, the JKL marketing team reached out to a focus group of their current customers to understand their relationship to the product. The customers walk them through their podcast production workflow using JKL software and share what features they love, along with what new features or changes they would like to see.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>After going through this exercise, JKL has gained valuable insight into their competitive landscape, product features to highlight, market growth opportunities, and ways to keep their current customer base engaged and using the platform.</p> \n<p>You're probably wondering, <em>\"How do I gather this information?\" </em>Below, let's review what tools and software you can use.</p> \n<h2>Market Intelligence Tools</h2> \n<p>For market intelligence to be useful, companies need to conduct research and sort through their collected data for analysis. A lot of this can be done through your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-use-crm\">CRM software</a>.</p> \n<p>To start, many CRMs allow you to create competitor profiles in which you will track your competitors' products, price points, organizational updates, social media activity, and more.</p> \n<p>You'll likely also find <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/battle-cards\">battle card templates </a>in your CRM, making it easy for your sales reps to access the information they need during their calls to combat objections and persuade prospects.</p> \n<p>In addition, you can conduct regular <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/questions-to-ask-win-loss-review\">win/loss analysis </a>with your sales team to determine strengths and weaknesses in your sales and/or marketing strategy. You'll want to know:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What factors are contributing to your wins and losses?</li> \n <li>What other company was the prospect considering for the sale? Why?</li> \n <li>Which competitors are you beating and which ones you are losing to?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you don't already have a CRM, there are many out there that cater to businesses ranging from small to enterprise-level. Pricing is usually structured on a monthly basis and can range anywhere from $20/month to $1200+.</p> \n<p>If your team would rather focus on specific tools, there are several online options to help you achieve your goals. Below are a few we recommend, divided into sections depending on your goals. Additionally, if you're a HubSpot user, many of these tools integrate with <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/all-categories?eco_search=market%20intelligence\"></a><a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/all-categories?eco_search=market%20intelligence\">HubSpot</a>.</p> \n<h3>Competitor Intelligence</h3> \n<h4>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">HubSpot's Marketing Hub</a></h4> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HubSpot-homepage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=HubSpot-homepage.jpg\" alt=\"Market-Intelligence-Marketing-Hub\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"http://Hubspot.com\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>HubSpot's Marketing Hub has extensive tools to help marketing teams manage, track and scale their efforts.

What do you want to learn and why? Use that to steer your approach.</p> \n<p>Having a clear direction is essential during this stage to narrow down what data to focus on. You'll be compiling a lot of data, and not all of it will be relevant to your main objective. Knowing which will be most impactful will save you so much time and allow you to use your resources efficiently.</p> \n<p>Now that you know what to focus on, start organizing and reviewing your data. You'll want to look for patterns. During this step, keep an open mind. Confirmation bias (the tendency to interpret information to support a pre-existing idea or belief) can greatly impact how you interpret data, so it's important to consider all perspectives.</p> \n<p>Once you identify a theme or trend, dive deeper to answer the 5Ws. <strong>When </strong>did it start? <strong>Who </strong>or <strong>what </strong>is influencing this? <strong>Why </strong>is it happening? <strong>Where </strong>else is this trend identified?</p> \n<p>From there, it's time to strategize. Based on what your data is telling you, you can develop an action plan and make recommendations to key stakeholders.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say your latest intel revealed that consumers are unaware of a key feature in your product line, which is steering them toward your competitors. Your recommendation could be to launch a marketing campaign that highlights that feature, create stronger messaging on your website product pages, and adjust the sales team's scripts to place more emphasis on this feature and how it's better suited for your customers than a competitor's.</p> \n<p>The formula is easy: collect, organize, identify, and recommend. Understanding your market is key to entering the market and maintaining your place in it. But if you want to stand out among your competition, you'll need to leverage market intel.</p> \n<p>Market intelligence can give you a holistic view of the market, improve customer retention, boost your efficiency, and give you a competitive advantage.

Content governance ensures that you have a definitive way for this content to reach them. Who creates the content? On what platform is it published? How will it be updated in the future? While these questions and their answers help shape content governance, its framework involves more.</p> \n<p>Content governance is more than consumer-facing content. It requires preliminary and behind-the-scenes work seen in an asset like an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blog-editorial-calendar-templates\">editorial content calendar</a>. Consumers don’t have access to your company’s content calendar; however, this is an irreplaceable tool to keep your company on track with its strategy. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31247/the-simple-template-for-a-thorough-content-style-guide.aspx\">Style guides</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-content-audit\">content audits</a> are other tools that assist with content governance but are unseen by consumers.</p> \n<p>Content governance encompasses content sent to consumers and content that waits for them. It is not only reserved for social media posts that land on their feed or emails sent to their inbox. It includes banner ads or frequently asked questions on your website. It’s your Instagram bio or the answering message you have for phone calls. In a business, content is <em>everywhere</em>, and content governance allows your business to manage all of its avenues.</p> \n<h2>Why is content governance important?</h2> \n<p>To illustrate the importance of content governance, let’s look at an analogy.</p> \n<p>Content marketing is like a first date. You wine and dine with visuals and information and hope it builds a budding relationship. If it does, how do you move forward and keep building?</p> \n<p>After that initial interaction, you publish two emails, one blog post, and four social media posts during week one. You drop the ball in week two. The amount of content decreases to one email and two social media posts. Week three is worse, but during week four, you’re able to publish three emails, two blog posts, and five social media posts. While the increase in content <em>seems</em> remarkable, your potential long-term customer has unsubscribed from your content after a month. Why?</p> \n<p><em>Content</em> needs to be <em>governed</em> by procedures and systems. Procedures mean consistency, and consistency is key to the success of any business. It shows effort and demonstrates to customers that you <em>care</em>.</p> \n<p>Content works as a cycle. Although the number of steps might differ for each organization, content life cycles typically follow this process:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Develop a strategy.</li> \n <li>Create the content.</li> \n <li>Store the content.</li> \n <li>Edit.</li> \n <li>Publish.</li> \n <li>Analyze.</li> \n <li>Update or repurpose content.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The content cycle never ends. There is always work to do. Use the steps above. If you finish strategizing, focus on content creation. If you’re not creating, your company can work on storing, editing, publishing, and more.</p> \n<p>Content governance is important because it ensures that your company maintains an efficient process in its continuous content cycle. It can prevent delays, inconsistent messaging, or even legal issues. Content governance helps:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Provide structure</li> \n <li>Establish clear roles and responsibilities</li> \n <li>Create detailed processes and workflows</li> \n <li>Outline company standards and policies</li> \n</ul> \n<p>A comprehensive content governance model creates a standard for effective, consistent content, resulting in continued success.</p> \n<p>The online world is fast-paced, and to keep up, businesses need to make sure that they’re covering all avenues. It used to mean website and email content; however, the growth of social media has expanded the number of channels businesses need to account for. Companies have had to shift gears and adjust their content strategies to accommodate social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.</p> \n<p>While content grows and changes, its governance models help companies scale, sustain, and recreate their content.</p> \n<h2>Creating a Content Governance Model</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-governance-models.png?width=650&amp;name=content-governance-models.png\" alt=\"content governance model components\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>You’re ready to create your content governance model. While each step might require extensive work, the process isn’t complicated. Building your content governance model requires four steps.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Establish and define the roles and responsibilities of the content team.</li> \n <li>Design content workflows.</li> \n <li>Create policies, standards, and procedures for content.</li> \n <li>Document guidelines and ensure company-wide compliance.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let's go over these one-by-one.</p> \n<h3>1. Establish and define the roles and responsibilities of the content team.</h3> \n<p>Good content doesn’t exist without people. While you could argue that the most vital person in the content experience is the consumer, you could also contend that content would not exist without the team.</p> \n<p>To create a content governance model, decide on the roles and responsibilities of those within the company. Content roles include strategists, writers, editors, and analysts. When defining the obligations of the people in these roles, think about their function. Team members typically have a strategic, operational, or specialist function.</p> \n<p>A strategic function, usually seen in roles like a content strategist, is for those who plan long-term strategy. Staff, who are operational, implement the content strategy daily. This work is carried out by writers, editors, photographers, and more. Lastly, members of the specialist function provide expert data to other team members. This could be an SEO specialist providing analytical information to strategists or writers that shape how they fulfill their role.</p> \n<p>When establishing the roles and responsibilities for your team, you might find it necessary to create an overlap in function. For example, it could be beneficial to have your content writers specialize in SEO. As long as there is a clear distinction in role and responsibility, there should be no issue in team management.</p> \n<h3>2. Design content workflows.</h3> \n<p>How does your content go from Point A to Point B? Point A is an idea while Point B is publication. Consumers cannot see this process, but multiple steps are necessary to reach publication.</p> \n<p>Content workflows follow these stages:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\"><strong>Strategy</strong></a><strong>:</strong> planning content</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\"><strong>Creation</strong></a><strong>:</strong> writing, designing, filming, content</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-editing-checklist\"><strong>Review</strong></a><strong>:</strong> editing and fact-checking content</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-distribution\"><strong>Publication/Distribution</strong></a><strong>:</strong> publishing and sharing content</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While the list is short, the process isn’t. Content takes time. Once you’re aware of what it takes to create your content, use this to shape your policies, standards, and procedures.</p> \n<h3>3. Create policies, standards, and procedures for content.</h3> \n<p>Once you have the proper people in place, it is time to focus on your policies, standards, and procedures. Content policies are the values and goals of a company. Standards are targets used to make sure that a company upholds its policies. Procedures are a step-by-step breakdown of who is involved and what steps are needed to achieve the ultimate goal.</p> \n<p>Consider this example. An online company has the <strong>policy</strong> to be a leading source of global news. The company enforces this policy by setting a <strong>standard</strong> for publishing at least 10 daily articles. Members of the content team, like the writers, editors, and publishers, have <strong>procedures</strong> to guide them through the content process and ensure that 10 articles are shared with the public every day.</p> \n<p>Once your company creates policies, standards, and procedures for content, finish the process with documentation and compliance.</p> \n<h3>4. Document guidelines and ensure company-wide compliance.</h3> \n<p>There is no use in creating a content governance model if no one knows about it. The most significant element of content governance is ensuring that the entire company has access to it and complies with it.</p> \n<p>Create documents for your company policies, standards, and procedures, and put them in a central location. Hold a meeting to walk through content processes and workflows. And lastly, regularly review and update your content governance models.</p> \n<h2>Content never ends.</h2> \n<p>Content lives on a lifecycle. You might think a blog post is complete after it is published and distributed, but its cycle continues with updates and redistribution. Managing one blog post without a system is most likely doable, but imagine an additional 20 content assets in one week. Scary, right?</p> \n<p>Without any checks and balances, creating and managing your content can become chaotic. Content governance prevents this. With a content governance model in place, your company will have the framework and processes in place to successfully execute your content strategy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Blog - Content Mapping Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcontent-governance-model&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png","linkMd5":"efb50cecee73553bb097274fdbb64fa9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-896_f8c910eb1e0201f6.webp","destWidth":483,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4217,"destBytes":7328,"author":"Lauren Gregory","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-896_f8c910eb1e0201f6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-governance-models.png?width=650&name=content-governance-models.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn35@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-10-423_b3f521e927bdbf87.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn24@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-12-685_d198dce450120884.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcontent-governance-model&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn66@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-13-833_94be14658fd1ad14.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705029},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"The Top 16 Best Email Marketing Services in 2022","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-marketing-services","description":"<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide\"><span>Email marketing</span></a> continues to be a critical strategy for marketing (and sales teams) across an array of industries and business types, and an email marketing platform is one of the first additions to a marketer's tool belt — and for good reason.<br><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4d91cc7a-0d35-48ce-89af-31794c494de9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Boost Opens &amp; CTRs with HubSpot’s Free Email Marketing Software\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4d91cc7a-0d35-48ce-89af-31794c494de9.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Email marketing remains a quick and effective way to engage and nurture leads into loyal customers.

The formula is as follows: <strong>= [The other cell] &lt; [value].</strong> In this case, the formula would be =e2&lt;0, as it signifies that cell A2 should turn red if E2’s value is less than 0.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"google sheets conditional formatting based on another cell's values\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Set%20Conditional%20Formatting%20Based%20on%20Another%20Cell%20in%20Google%20Sheets-2.png?width=200&amp;name=How%20to%20Set%20Conditional%20Formatting%20Based%20on%20Another%20Cell%20in%20Google%20Sheets-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 200px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\"></p> \n<p>With so many functions to play with, Google Sheets can seem daunting.

A battlefield for brand experience. If companies can create a lasting positive impression among potential customers, they can drive sales and set the stage for long-term loyalty. But what exactly is brand experience? What does effective design require and what does it look like in practice? Most importantly, how do brands create experience strategies that deliver reliable results over time?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Brand experience describes the tangible and emotional experience consumers have while interacting with your brand. Think of it as a holistic approach that combines elements of user experience, customer experience, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">brand identity</a> all in one.</p> \n<p>Brand experience encompasses all the feelings consumers have before, during, and after interacting with your brand. Take <a href=\"https://www.nestle.com/brands/allbrands/toll-house\">Nestlé Toll House</a> for example. When most people think of them, they think of cookies. You may even remember baking cookies using Toll House chocolate chips, the smell as they baked, and finally, savoring every last bite. You may even associate the brand with moments of bonding with family as you baked cookies together.</p> \n<p>In this case, the Toll House brand experience has moved beyond just the consumption of chocolate chips. It’s an emotional connection built over time with consumers and how their products integrate into the lives of the people who buy them.</p> \n<p>While brand experience is similar to user experience, it encompasses a broader perception of your brand at large. Where user experience speaks to the takeaways — positive or negative — of a user when they interact with your website or social media profiles, brand experience refers to the impression of your brand as a whole. Not surprisingly, positive user experiences inform better brand experiences (and vice versa) but the two are distinct concepts.</p> \n<p>It’s also important to understand that brand experience is subjective. While it’s possible to create experiences that produce reactions along a generalized spectrum, individual users will have different reactions to your efforts. In practice, this means that no matter how carefully you curate brand experience efforts, there will always be customers who come away with a negative reaction. As a result, the goal isn’t to create a universal experience but rather to create one that resonates positively with the largest number of target customers.</p> \n<h2>Breaking Down Brand Experience Design</h2> \n<p>Just <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2021/04/26/brand-experience-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-it-be-your-differentiator/\">39%</a> of business decision-makers say their brand effectively resonates with prospective buyers. This is a problem: If customers don’t connect your brand with positive thoughts, feelings, and reactions, they’re less likely to remember your products and services when it comes time to make a purchase.</p> \n<p>Worth noting? Neutrality isn’t enough. While negative impressions of your brand can drive customers away from your site, neutral impressions are just as problematic — even if consumers see your brand listed in search engine results or advertised online, the absence of a positive brand impression means they won’t seek you out over companies that offer better connective messaging.</p> \n<p>So what does effective brand experience design look like? Four components are critical:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Brand%20Experience.jpg?width=650&amp;name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Brand%20Experience.jpg\" alt=\"Brand Experience vs. Customer Experience\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<h3>Perception</h3> \n<p>Perception forms a key part of the experience. This includes audio, visual, and tactical interactions that allow customers to connect a specific sense to advertising campaigns. In much the same way that particular smells can bring back memories of childhood experiences, brands that successfully merge senses with marketing can create connections that drive sales.</p> \n<h3>Participation</h3> \n<p>It’s also more likely that customers will walk away with a positive brand experience if they’re able to participate in some way rather than simply watch. This might include the ability to submit suggestions online or interact in real-time online question forums, or it could feature the use of physical installations that allow consumers to touch your product or provide direct feedback.</p> \n<h3>Personalization</h3> \n<p>Generic marketing campaigns can produce steady returns, but personalization can help encourage connection across different customer segments. By leveraging both user-provided data (with their consent) along with social media interactions and other engagement data, it’s possible to create more personalized efforts that help create connections between consumer needs and current product offerings.</p> \n<h3>Prioritization</h3> \n<p>Brand experience can’t be all things to all people. Attempts to capture every consumer in every circumstance actually undermine experience-driven efforts — as a result, it’s worth selecting specific brand metrics such as positive social mentions or repeat purchases to prioritize.</p> \n<h2>Creating a Brand Experience Strategy</h2> \n<p>So how do you build an effective brand experience strategy?</p> \n<h3>1. Assess whether or not you’re meeting customer expectations.</h3> \n<p>First up is identifying areas where your current experience isn’t meeting customer expectations. Social media interactions and customer service calls can help pinpoint potential problems — if consistent concerns around brand interaction or reaction arise, this can help frame the foundation of brand experience strategy.</p> \n<h3>2. Identify areas for improvement.</h3> \n<p>Next is targeting an area for improvement. While there may be more than one aspect of brand experience that could use a refresh or redesign, attempting to do everything at once can spread strategy efforts too thin and deliver less-than-ideal results. For example, you might choose to increase positive social mentions across specific channels such as Facebook or Instagram. While the eventual goal could be a larger social impact from initial contact to eventual conversion, easily-accessible social platforms provide an ideal starting point.</p> \n<h3>3. Measure your results.</h3> \n<p>Effective measurement follows to ensure efforts are bearing fruit. In the case of our social media example above, this means tracking user views, reactions, and responses to social media posts along with the sentiment — positive, negative, or neutral — that goes along with them. This is also the time to explore and innovate by testing multiple strategies to see which one sticks. From video campaigns to personalized storytelling to marketing efforts all designed to elicit specific emotions, it’s worth finding that resonates with your customer base and then fine-tuning your efforts to deliver ideal outcomes.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>It’s one thing to talk about brand experience building, but it’s another to see it in action. Here’s a look at five brand experiences efforts that offer effective in-practice examples.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a></h3> \n<a class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\"></a>\n<a style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 367px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.46%; margin: 0;\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pJIKPzZTJXM?feature=oembed\" width=\"650\" height=\"367\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> </a> \n<p>One of the reasons Apple has such a devoted customer base is because of the brand experience they’ve created. From ads to Apple stores to the packaging of their products — all touch points work together to create a cohesive brand experience that highlights innovation, style, and functionality.</p> \n<p>Their products are cool, sleek, and user-friendly, all attributes highly coveted by Apple’s fans. Even their product announcements have become anticipated events. Apple is a pro at conquering the four \"Ps\" of brand experience (perception, participation, personalization, and prioritization) and incorporating them in all messaging. This helps Apple stay top of mind for consumers whether they’re in the market to buy or not. It’s not a smart phone, it’s an iPhone. It’s not a laptop, it’s a MacBook.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FHtvDA0W34I\">Red Bull</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHtvDA0W34I\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2012, the company went all-in on its tagline “Red Bull gives you wings by sending skydiver Alex Baumgartner 24 miles above the Earth’s surface to pull off the highest skydive ever recorded and become the first person to break the sound barrier during freefall.</p> \n<p>While his record was broken two years later by an executive from Google, it doesn’t change the fact that Red Bull did something no one had ever done before and created a unique brand experience that aligned with its core marketing message.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RrftWVessAw\">Cadbury India</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrftWVessAw\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Cadbury India opted for consumer suggestions in creating their new chocolate bar flavor. Customers were encouraged to visit the company’s dedicated chocolate bar platform that let them select ingredients and create a recipe. Cadbury then tried all suggested recipes and selected the best of those submitted.</p> \n<p>By prioritizing interaction over simple reaction, Cadbury facilitated consumer connection and encouraged customers to view chocolate bar making as a collaborative effort rather than a corporate endeavor, in turn creating a community-based brand experience.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/\">Nike</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUldMpGbBdA\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Similarly to Cadbury, Nike found that giving customers more control over their products was a win. <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/nike-by-you\">Nike By You</a> allows customers to customize their favorite Nike kicks online using various color and style combinations.</p> \n<p>Their flagship store in NYC’s SoHo boasts a sneaker bar where customers can customize their shoes in person with dip-dyeing, patches, and accessories. This emphasis on customization and personalization allows Nike to fully integrate into their customers' lives, creating a brand experience that lasts long after they’ve made a purchase.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eaB8XkpHd64\">Lean Cuisine</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaB8XkpHd64\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>While healthy eating has taken off in recent years, messaging around this effort is often the opposite. With a focus on weight loss instead of overall health, many brands find themselves reinforcing harmful stereotypes that equate weight loss with personal worth.</p> \n<p>Lean Cuisine’s #WeighThis campaign looked to change the narrative by placing “scales” around New York’s Grand Central Station that encouraged women to “weigh in”.</p> \n<p>The catch? These scales were actually boards that let women write down how they would prefer to be measured — such as by their own persistence, accomplishments or efforts.</p> \n<p>Even better? Lean Cuisine marketers were smart enough to stay out of the way. There were no samples on offer, no surveys to fill out; women simply saw the scales and interacted with them, in turn boosting Lean Cuisine’s overall brand experience.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wpM499XhMJQ\">Dove</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 488px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 75.08%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wpM499XhMJQ\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty took a similar approach to Lean Cuisine but opted for the use of viral video that highlighted beauty of all types — beauty that goes beyond photoshoots and photoshop. The campaign earned praise for both its authenticity and efforts to help boost self-esteem among young girls.</p> \n<p>By choosing emotional experience over a simple sales effort, Dove was able to better connect with its target customer base and boost overall customer loyalty.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/\">Zillow</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWOY9-X5mSg\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Zillow’s “To Move is to Grow” campaign tapped into 2021’s pandemic house hunting frenzy. As people started remote work, folks realized that they didn’t need to live in crowded cities, and browsing the home search site quickly became a common pastime, which <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yEfsaXDX0UQ\">Saturday Night Live</a> hilariously highlighted in one of its skits that year.</p> \n<p>Tugging at our heartstrings, Zillow tackled the emotional rollercoaster of moving. Using an aesthetic reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/where-wild-things-are\"><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em></a>, the first commercial showcases a child unsure about what her moving adventure will bring. The second one hones in on a seller’s perspective. Susan, the main character, is faced with a host of doppelgangers that try to influence her decision.</p> \n<p>With many across the globe feeling like their lives were in flux, Zillow was able to create a brand experience that showed empathy with their customers as they navigated their new normal during a pandemic. It also positioned the brand as a reliable guide to assist with their transition, whether buying or selling.</p> \n<h3>8.<a href=\"https://youtu.be/OSYhPIAIU9o\"> WestJet</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 367px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.46%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OSYhPIAIU9o\" width=\"650\" height=\"367\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Canadian commercial airline WestJet has been running its “Christmas Miracle” campaign since 2013. Its 2021 version sees the company asking people what they miss the most during the holidays — not surprisingly, many mention absent family members. WestJet staff then provide plane tickets to help loved ones reconnect, and the end of the video features a tearful reunion in progress.</p> \n<p>Overall, it’s a feel-good experience designed to bring out emotions already close to the surface for many customers and in turn, boost the overall brand experience.</p> \n<h2>Building a Better Brand Experience</h2> \n<p>The right brand experience makes all the difference when it comes to cultivating long-term customer relationships. By understanding where current efforts don’t deliver, prioritizing areas for improvement, and tracking engagement metrics over time, it’s possible to build a brand experience that boosts customer connection and encourages long-term loyalty.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in February 2016 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"brand consistency\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-experience&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png","linkMd5":"25b8724829410ff484ff4f980aa01943","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn34@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-06-083_eac7fa40866dc905.webp","destWidth":382,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4555,"destBytes":6088,"author":"Doug Bonderud","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn34@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-06-083_eac7fa40866dc905.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Brand%20Experience.jpg?width=650&name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Brand%20Experience.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-13-546_e3b7fe945edb1991.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn34@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-09-474_f4156d3bc1379fd0.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-experience&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn21@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-15-028_7523cd1b4a8ce620.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705072},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"What is Context Marketing?

That’s what context marketing is all about.</p> \n<p>Here, we're going to introduce the concept of context marketing and dive into strategies you can use to implement it into your overall marketing strategy.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Resource: Content Marketing Planning Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>My favorite context marketing definition is delivering the right content, to the right people, at the right time.</p> \n<p>Let me explain what I mean by context a little more, though. When you have context around something, you have a larger, more telling picture — you know, those little details that lend more clarity to things that would otherwise be pretty general, unspecific, and, well, uninteresting.</p> \n<p>The best marketers leverage context about their audience, leads, and customers in their content marketing. They create <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/audience-profile\">audience profiles</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer personas</a> and use that information to create more effective marketing and advertising campaigns.</p> \n<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of context marketing, you might be wondering what the difference is between content marketing and context marketing. Let’s take a look below.</p> \n<p>A marketer using context would know more about a lead than her first name. They might also know what industry she works in, what kind of content she likes best, through which channel she prefers to consume content, whether she's currently using another solution to meet her needs, and whether her company has budget at this time of year.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, if you were asked to \"market\" to someone, and all you were given was a first name and the type of company your lead works at, wouldn't your first question be ... what else do we know about her? Probably, if you want to do your job way better.</p> \n<p>That's the idea behind context marketing: Using what you know about your contacts to provide supremely relevant, targeted, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-personalize-marketing-li\">personalized marketing</a>.</p> \n<h2>Why is context marketing important?</h2> \n<p>Context marketing is important for many reasons, but there are two top ones that make its importance even more salient. Let’s go over them below.</p> \n<h3>Context marketing converts better.</h3> \n<p>When you're creating marketing that's targeted at people's point of need, it stands to reason that marketing will perform much better for you, because you aren't delivering marketing content that's misaligned with their interests or stage in the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buyer’s journey</a>.</p> \n<p>Think about it: If you know that a B2B lead is getting a new budget in January and it's December, you're able to send her insanely targeted content that addresses her needs — like, say, an offer for a custom demo of your product with a rep that specializes in the finance industry. That's content that she's pretty likely to convert on, especially if she's downloaded a buying guide and visited your product pages.</p> \n<p><strong>Hot tip</strong>: Keeping track of your prospect’s activity using <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/marketing-automation\">marketing automation software</a> will make context marketing easier. You’ll know which products your prospect is most interested in and how many times they’ve visited your website.</p> \n<h3>Context marketing increases retention.</h3> \n<p>When you have context around your relationship with a contact, you're able to provide more personalized and relevant marketing content that's targeted to their needs.</p> \n<p>This is great for two reasons: Personalized and relevant marketing is the foundation for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\">creating content</a> people love and engage with. What's more, personalized and relevant marketing is typically not the kind of marketing that annoys people into clicking \"unsubscribe\". If they feel like you’re out to solve their problems specifically, customers are much more likely to stay with you.</p> \n<p>Why not use the context around your relationships with your contacts to create marketing that they love and convert on? Let’s take a look at how you can get started.</p> \n<h2>How to Start Context Marketing</h2> \n<p>Alright, how does this \"context marketing\" theory manifest itself? What would it look like for you, as a marketer? With the help of <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33894/what-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=integrated%20marketing%20software\">marketing automation software</a>, here are some examples of where you'd actually use the principle of \"context\" in your marketing.</p> \n<h3>1. Create specific offers for specific posts and pages.</h3> \n<p>One easy way you can start context marketing? Create offers that extend the value of your website. Bonus points if these offers answer a specific pain point or problem that a customer is trying to solve for when visiting that page.</p> \n<p>Most blog posts in HubSpot’s library feature an offer that’s directly related to the topic of the article. For instance, in our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-plan-template-generator?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\">blog post about creating a marketing plan</a>, you can download a marketing plan template — which is something that someone wanting to create a marketing plan might need.</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-offer.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-offer.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: specific offer on HubSpot blog post\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></h3> \n<p>Come up with content offers that will benefit your readers and website visitors depending on the page they’re visiting. For instance, if you sell hiking shoes and you’re writing a blog post about going on a solo hiking trip, you might feature an offer for downloading a solo hiking checklist.</p> \n<h3>2. Add smart calls-to-action (CTAs) to your website.</h3> \n<p>You can take personalized offers to the next level by featuring smart <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/calls-to-action?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33894/what-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=dynamic%20CTAs\">calls-to-action</a>. Let’s say you have a variety of offers you want to use to convert traffic into leads, leads into qualified leads, and qualified leads into customers.</p> \n<p>To <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-increase-conversion-rate\">increase your lead conversion rates</a>, you probably don't want leads visiting a case study webpage (typically an action you'd perform further along in your buyer's journey), and finding a CTA leading them to a blog post (which is meant for people earlier in the buyer's journey).</p> \n<p>However, not everyone who visits a case study page on your website is necessarily ready to talk to a salesperson. You don't want to turn them away, either, by offering a CTA that's too pushy.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, with smart CTAs, you can actually surface a CTA that automatically aligns with the visitor's stage in the sales cycle ... or any other host of criteria you want to set. Think industry, business type, location, and past activity/behaviors.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you have already downloaded an offer from HubSpot, you might see this CTA on certain social-media-related posts:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-smart-cta.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-smart-cta.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: smart cta\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>But if you haven’t downloaded an offer before, you’ll see the default CTA:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-default-cta.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-default-cta.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: default cta\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>This type of smart content can help you capture your audience’s information at all stages of their buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p><strong>Hot tip</strong>: HubSpot’s marketing automation software lets you <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/ctas/create-smart-calls-to-action-cta\">easily create a smart calls-to-action</a> with little technical knowledge.</p> \n<h3>3. Create smart forms that shorten the conversion cycle.</h3> \n<p>Smart forms know if someone has already filled out the form fields you're asking for. If you use smart forms, for instance, your site visitors won't see \"First Name\" and \"Last Name\" every time they fill out a form — instead, they'll answer those questions once, and then never again.</p> \n<p>This will help you glean new information about your leads each time they fill out a form, instead of just more of the same stuff. It also helps you create a more seamless, personalized user experience that leverages prior interactions with your website as context.</p> \n<p>Here’s one example from HubSpot Academy. This is what I see when I’m logged into the HubSpot CRM:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-smart-form.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-smart-form.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: smart form\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>The form knows I’m a current HubSpot customer and doesn’t require me to create a new account. I only have to click one button: “Start the Course.”</p> \n<p>But this is what I see when I’m not logged in:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-default-form.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-default-form.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: default form\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Ultimately, smart forms will help you gather even more context about your visitors, leads, and customers, and help increase conversion rates over time.</p> \n<p><strong>Hot tip</strong>: You can easily <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cos-general/create-smart-forms?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33894/what-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=smart%20forms\">create smart forms</a> inside HubSpot’s marketing automation software.</p> \n<h3>4. Leverage dynamic email content and workflows.</h3> \n<p>Your forms and offers aren't the only things that need to be smart. Your email database — especially if you want to maintain your space in people's coveted inboxes — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-list-segmentation\">needs to be segmented</a> into highly targeted lists, as well.</p> \n<p>I happen to be subscribed to Grammarly emails on both my work and personal emails. Because I only use the Grammarly Chrome extension at work, I receive emails like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-segmented-email-example.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-segmented-email-example.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: grammarly segmented email\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">In my personal account, however, I use Grammarly’s web app regularly and review thousands of words for a personal project. Here’s the email I get:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-segmented-email-grammarly.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-segmented-email-grammarly.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: grammarly second segmented email\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Throughout the email, Grammarly prompts you to upgrade to the premium version and take advantage of its other tools. Because I don’t use the Chrome extension in my personal email account, it includes a call-to-action to install the extension. It’s delightful to receive an email that uses my account activity as context.</p> \n<p>Beyond email segmentation, your email lists need to be smart enough to know when to pull in a contact, and certain information you have in your database about that contact, into your email marketing campaigns.</p> \n<p>Remember, a great context marketer delivers the right content, to the right person, at the right time. So to send emails that are contextually relevant, you need to use their activity and background to deliver personalized content that delights them and prompts them to convert.</p> \n<h2>Context Marketing Examples</h2> \n<p>While context marketing may sound complicated, it’s actually quite simple in practice. In fact, as a customer, you may have seen or enjoyed context marketing yourself. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p> \n<h3>1. Google’s Product Ads Carousel</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-google.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-google.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: google product carousel ads\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Have you ever looked up a product on Google and see a carousel at the top (as opposed to just the plain search results)? The products you see are typically ads for the exact same thing you searched for.</p> \n<p>This is a prime contextual marketing example. Google uses your behavior and search query to deliver ads that are contextually relevant. Imagine if, when searching for instant coffee, Google delivers ads for french presses instead. While you might be interested in French presses and even searched for them before, you’re looking for instant coffee right now.</p> \n<p>That’s why it’s important to answer for your customer’s specific pain points and queries, and to do so at the right time. And you don’t have to be a highly sophisticated search engine to do so. Remember those offers we spoke about in the previous sections? That can function in the same way as Google’s product carousels.</p> \n<h3>2. Asana’s New Feature Pop-Up</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-asana.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-asana.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: asana feature popup\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>There’s no more powerful place to carry out contextual marketing than right within your own product, website, or store. Asana’s example shows that you can upsell customers easily by marketing a new feature and prompting them to try it for free.</p> \n<p>This is an excellent example of contextual marketing because you wouldn’t be interested in trying this new feature unless you were a current Asana user. For instance, if Asana had placed this pop-up on their homepage, they likely wouldn’t have much success with it. But because it pops up after you log in, you’re more likely to say, “Sure, I’ll try it.”</p> \n<p>You can achieve something similar by instituting a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-personalization-examples-dynamic\">website personalization campaign</a>. When people visit your product page, for instance, they might see a popup to schedule a meeting with a salesperson. But when they’re on the blog, they might see a popup to subscribe. These simple changes can help you capture more leads and use the context from their activity to deliver an offer they won’t resist.</p> \n<h3>3. LinkedIn Company Page Sidebar Ad</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-linkedin.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-linkedin.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: linkedin sidebar ad on company page\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>When you visit a company page on LinkedIn, it provides a little sidebar ad that prompts you to find roles at that company that match your skills.</p> \n<p>LinkedIn does this because it knows that you might be open to opportunities even if you don’t list it on your profile. And if you’re looking at a company page, you might be interested in working at that firm. LinkedIn uses this context to deliver a relevant ad that you can’t help but click on.</p> \n<p>Another reason this is such a great example is that it also lists a job title that relates to yours. So if you’re a financial advisor and are looking at JP Morgan Chase’s company page, LinkedIn will automatically advertise financial advisor roles at the firm.</p> \n<h2>Context Marketing is the Next Evolution of Content Marketing</h2> \n<p>Without context, you risk reaching the wrong people at the wrong time. Begin using context in all of your marketing and advertising campaigns, and you’ll see an exponential increase in conversions, helping you exceed your lead acquisition goals and increase revenue at your company.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in March 2013 and has been updated for comprehensiveness. &nbsp;</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=870b6a31-0a25-444f-b61e-ff427ef5d5e9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/870b6a31-0a25-444f-b61e-ff427ef5d5e9.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33894%2Fwhat-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png","linkMd5":"8de5b4e256b6857e4dbfeb621ddf7cc6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-896_f8c910eb1e0201f6.webp","destWidth":483,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4217,"destBytes":7328,"author":"cwainwright@hubspot.com (Corey Wainwright)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-896_f8c910eb1e0201f6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-offer.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-offer.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn60@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-13-673_cf3cc15789b2f2c2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-smart-cta.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-smart-cta.jpeg":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-default-cta.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-default-cta.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn26@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-15-156_77b492ecc8a3477a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-smart-form.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-smart-form.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn17@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-10-761_5678881b4f444985.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-default-form.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-default-form.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn2@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-10-811_bf5175b4624dede1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-segmented-email-example.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-segmented-email-example.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn98@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-10-879_d13026b6103dc8b8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-segmented-email-grammarly.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-segmented-email-grammarly.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-13-632_530a1899326fc6a0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-google.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-google.jpeg":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-asana.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-asana.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-12-469_58076d071c0fe40e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-linkedin.jpeg?width=650&name=context-marketing-example-linkedin.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn27@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-12-818_84925f2cfe38035b.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/870b6a31-0a25-444f-b61e-ff427ef5d5e9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn76@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-13-975_a503d8d93299c9f1.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33894%2Fwhat-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn98@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-11-766_758581dd55b002b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705069},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"Does Your Company Need An Employee Referral Program? [Examples + Best Practices]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/employee-referral-program","description":"<p>Finding qualified candidates to fill your open positions can be challenging. Job posting sites claim to make the process easy by connecting you with hundreds if not thousands of potential employees. But having such a large pool of candidates can be overwhelming.</p>  \n<p>Just thinking about the sheer volume of work involved in reviewing applications, narrowing them down to good fits, and then vetting those potential candidates is enough to make anyone’s head explode.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Company Culture Code Template&nbsp;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>You work with or run a solid organization with wonderful employees. How do you make sure that you don’t get a bevy of potential candidates, but rather the <em>right</em> candidate?</p> \n<p>Look at this like finding the perfect place to take your significant other on a special occasion. Sure, you could do a Google search for random restaurants in your neighborhood. You could even check a review site for recommendations.</p> \n<p>However, you don’t know any of those people, so how much weight does their opinion really carry? Instead of taking a risk on a very special evening, why not reach out to the people you trust? Asking friends and family for a recommendation is a much safer avenue to finding the perfect date night experience.</p> \n<p>What if we applied this type of thinking to your search for the perfect employee? Rather than leave it up to a random internet search, ask the people you already know, like, and trust… your employees.</p> \n<h2>What is an employee referral program?</h2> \n<p>An employee referral program is a structured system by which you ask existing employees to recommend people they know for open positions within your organization. Employees often receive some sort of incentive for their assistance.</p> \n<p>An employee referral program leverages the power of your employees’ networks and can save you time, money, and a huge headache when it comes to hiring the best talent for your business.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of an Employee Referral Program</h2> \n<p>There are many benefits to utilizing an employee referral program as part of your hiring strategy. These include:</p> \n<h3>1. High Quality Hires</h3> \n<p>Good employees know what skills are necessary to excel in a position and understand the workplace culture. When they recommend someone for the job, there’s a good chance they have the qualifications necessary to successfully perform in the role.</p> \n<h3>2. Decreased Turnover Rates</h3> \n<p>With employee turnover rates <a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/advice/employee-turnover-statistics/\"><span>on the rise</span></a>, you’ll want to keep it front of mind when you’re making hiring decisions. According to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employee-referral-statistics-you-need-know-2020-mike-stafiej/?articleId=6622562177335336961\"><span>ERIN</span></a>, 45% of referred employees stay with a company longer compared to 22% from job boards and 33% from career sites.</p> \n<h3>3. Less Time and Lower Cost Per Hire</h3> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/resources/pdfs/new_employee_referral_programs_FINAL.pdf\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a>, employees hired through referrals take an average of 29 days to hire and onboard, whereas job boards can take 39 days and a career site can take upwards of 55 days. The less time it takes to hire and onboard means less revenue lost, fewer employees stressed because they are handling multiple jobs, and more productivity from your new hire.</p> \n<p>Using a headhunter? According to <a href=\"https://www.jobvite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Jobvite-RecruiterNation-Report-Final.pdf\"><span>Jobvite</span></a>, you can expect to pay between 15% and 25% of the gross annual salary of the candidate. If you’re hiring an employee at $100k per year, that’s $15k to $25k in headhunting fees. The cost to reward an employee for an amazing referral? Around $2,000.</p> \n<h3>4. Increase Employee Satisfaction and Loyalty</h3> \n<p>Doesn’t it feel nice when you have a hand in the decision-making process? Employees that refer candidates feel like they’ve contributed to the company, making them more engaged and more likely to stay.</p> \n<h2>Employee Referral Program Ideas</h2> \n<p>Now that you see the benefit to you as the employer or hiring manager, how do you create an employee referral program that encourages your existing employees to introduce you to their quality contacts? There are a number of ways to do this and best practices that you can adopt to get the most out of your program.</p> \n<h3>Make it Clear What You’re Looking For</h3> \n<p>In a mid-sized to a large company, one department may have no idea what another one is working on. In order for employees to make connections, they need to know what your expectations are for the new position. When you reach out to employees looking for suggestions, provide them with all the details you can. This should include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-job-descriptions\"><span>Job descriptions</span></a></li> \n <li>Desired experience</li> \n <li>Necessary skills</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Make it Easy for Employees to Refer</h3> \n<p>Consider the referral experience from your employees’ point of view. Is there a simple form for them to submit when they recommend someone, or do they have to jump through a variety of complicated hoops to pass along their referrals? Some companies even host recruitment happy hours where existing employees can invite friends who might be a good fit.</p> \n<p>The easier you make it for your employees to refer their contacts, the more quality candidates will be presented to you.</p> \n<h3>Keep Your Employees Updated on Referral Status</h3> \n<p>It’s frustrating to make a suggestion or an introduction and not know if it’s been acted upon. When your employee recommends a colleague, keep them updated as to the steps of the hiring process. Some times to check-in include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>When you receive an application</li> \n <li>When you make contact</li> \n <li>When an interview is scheduled</li> \n <li>When a position has been offered to their contact</li> \n <li>When the position has been given to someone else (after the candidate has been contacted)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Provide a Juicy Incentive</h3> \n<p>Surprisingly, this may not always be a monetary reward. While money is always appreciated, you can offer a combination of \"cash\" and experiences, time off, gifts, etc. For some, these may be even more desired than a financial incentive. One great option is to give your employees the choice. That way, you know they’ll be motivated to help. A few employee referral incentive ideas to get your creative juices flowing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Cash bonuses</li> \n <li>Gift certificates to their favorite restaurants and local establishments</li> \n <li>Weekend getaways or week-long excursions for frequent referrers</li> \n <li>VIP parking</li> \n <li>Show tickets</li> \n <li>Physical gifts (it’s important to let them choose so they don’t end up with something they can’t use)</li> \n <li>Perks like a gym membership or massage</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The sky's the limit when it comes to thanking your employees for their referrals. You can also consider using a platform like <a href=\"https://www.xoxoday.com/\">XoxoDay</a> to make distributing employee referral perks as easy and streamlined as possible.</p> \n<h3>Show Appreciation for \"Frequent Referrers\"</h3> \n<p>If you’ve got employees that consistently send you quality employee candidates, acknowledge them publicly. This shows your amazing team members that they are appreciated and motivates other employees to step up their referral game.</p> \n<h2>Employee Referral Program Examples</h2> \n<p>Looking for real-world examples of these programs in action? We’ve compiled a few employee referral program samples to introduce you to some of the possibilities.</p> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.inmobi.com/\"><span>Inmobi</span></a>, a mobile advertising company offers referring employees the choice of a bike or a trip to Bali. They park the vehicles in front of the company headquarters to motivate employees to participate.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\"><span>Accenture</span></a>, a consulting and IT company encourages philanthropy and community involvement by letting their employees donate a part of their referral bonus to a charity of their choice.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://distillery.com/\"><span>Distillery</span></a>, an American software development company gifts their employees new tech gadgets for every referral they make.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/\"><span>Atlassian</span></a> software company encourages employees to \"Refer-a-Mate\" and offers them $2,000 in cash bonuses.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html\"><span>Intel</span></a> tech company takes financial incentives one step further by doubling their employee referral reward for women, minorities, and veterans that are referred to the company.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>If you’d like to tap into a pool of qualified, trustworthy, easy-to-hire (and onboard) candidates, an employee referral program can help. Instituting this type of hiring process in your organization can save you money, time, headaches, and the pain of having to repeatedly hire for the same position when your first employee doesn’t work out well. In addition, you’ll improve your workplace culture and enhance your brand.</p> \n<p>An employee referral program is the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your incoming employees. Choose your incentives wisely and then watch the quality candidates roll on in.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4bbcf7f8-3c11-4d5b-b284-c5f6a9d419c9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"company culture template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4bbcf7f8-3c11-4d5b-b284-c5f6a9d419c9.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Femployee-referral-program&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b.png","linkMd5":"ad7181ffe31559a408a75af9a3fd7bc0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn91@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-05-733_af47b0cd123e84fb.webp","destWidth":489,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5237,"destBytes":7504,"author":"Sheryl Green","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn91@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-05-733_af47b0cd123e84fb.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4bbcf7f8-3c11-4d5b-b284-c5f6a9d419c9.png":null,"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Femployee-referral-program&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn75@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-21-265_aa77a0f97e109ceb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705115},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"The Plain-English Guide to Conjoint Analysis","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conjoint-analysis","description":"<p>Sometimes, commercials <em>really</em> get me.</p>  \n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/video/2019-super-bowl-commercials-sprint/\">T-Mobile</a>'s Super Bowl commercial this year is a prime example — \"What's for Dinner?\" demonstrates the infuriating process of choosing what to do for dinner for a young couple, and it's<em> gold</em>.</p> \n<p>The reason T-Mobile's ad was so relatable is because of their market research.

Attributes you might consider are color, size, and model. The reason phone companies include these specs in their marketing is due to research such as conjoint analysis.</p> \n<p><em>Would consumers purchase this product or service if brought to market?</em> That's the question conjoint analysis strives to answer. It's a quantitative measure in marketing research, meaning it measures numbers rather than open-ended questions. Questions on the phone company survey would include price points, color preference, and camera quality.</p> \n<p>Surveys intended for conjoint analysis are formatted to reflect the buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>For instance, notice in this example for televisions, the specs are the options and the consumer picks what best reflects their lifestyle:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/conjoint%20analysis%20example.png?width=706&amp;name=conjoint%20analysis%20example.png\" alt=\"conjoint analysis example\" width=\"706\" style=\"width: 706px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10px;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.surveygizmo.com/resources/blog/conjoint-analysis/\">Image Source</a></strong></span></em></p> \n<p>This direct method of giving consumers multiple profiles to then analyze is how conjoint analysis got its name. These answers are helpful when determining how to market a new product.</p> \n<p>If answers on the phone company survey proved that their target audience of adults ages 18-25 wanted a green phone from $400-600 and a camera with portrait mode, advertisements can cater directly to that.</p> \n<p>The conjoint analysis shows what consumers are willing to give up in order to get what they need. For instance, some might be willing to pay a little more money for a larger model of a phone if their preference is larger text.</p> \n<h2>Types of Conjoint Analysis</h2> \n<p>Choice-based conjoint (CBC) and Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA) are the two main types of conjoint analysis.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Choice-based is the most common form because it asks consumers to mimic their buying habits. ACA is helpful for product design, offering more questions about specs of a product.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Choice-based conjoint analysis questions are usually presented in a \"Would you rather?\" format. For example, \"Would you rather take a ride-share service to a location 10 minutes away for $13 or walk 30 minutes for free?\" The marketer for the ride-share service could use answers from this question to think of the upsides to show off in different campaigns.</p> \n<p>ACA leans towards a Likert-scale format (most likely to least likely) for its attribute-based questions. Respondents can base their preference on specs by showing how likely they are to buy a product with slight differences — for example, similar cars with different doors and manufacturers.</p> \n<h2>How To Do A Conjoint Analysis</h2> \n<p>To create a conjoint analysis, you'll first need to define a list of attributes about your product. Attributes are usually four to five items that describe your product or service. Consider color, size, price, and market-specific attributes, such as lenses if you're selling cameras.</p> \n<p>Additionally, try to keep in mind your ideal respondents. Who do you want to answer your survey? A group of adult men? A group of working mothers? Identify your respondent base and ask specific questions catered to that target market.</p> \n<p>The next step is to organize your questionnaire depending on the type of conjoint analysis you want to conduct. For instance, to run an adaptive conjoint analysis, you will present questions with a Likert-scale.</p> \n<p>You can use a conjoint analysis tool to create and modify your survey. Then, you can distribute your questionnaire through multiple channels, including email, SMS, and social media.</p> \n<p>For more ways to introduce product marketing into your company, check out our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-marketing?_ga=2.125836493.1138478006.1643301254-748143700.1643301254\"><span>ultimate guide here</span></a>.</p> \n<h2>Examples of Conjoint Analysis</h2> \n<p>Sawtooth Software offers a great example of conjoint analysis for a phone company:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/conjoint%20analysis%20example%202.png?width=752&amp;name=conjoint%20analysis%20example%202.png\" alt=\"conjoint analysis example\" width=\"752\" style=\"width: 752px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.sawtooth.com/index.php/consulting/conjoint-analysis-example/\">Image Source</a></em></span></p> \n<p>The analysis puts three different phone services next to each other. The horizontal column of the model identifies which service is offering a certain program, described by the vertical values. The bottom row shows a percent value of consumers' preferences.</p> \n<p>QuestionPro offers this <a href=\"https://www.questionpro.com/survey-templates/conjoint-analysis-retirement-housing/\">fun, interactive conjoint analysis template</a> about retirement home options. The survey gives you a scenario and asks your course of action. For instance, it asks if you would sign a rental agreement for retirement home housing immediately, and considers specs like rent, meals, size, etc.</p> \n<p>Conjoint analysis isn't limited to existing products. They're also very helpful for figuring out if a brand-new product is worth developing. For instance, if surveys show that audiences would be into the idea of an app that chooses clothes for consumers, that could be a new venture for clothing companies in the future.</p> \n<p>Looking to create a conjoint analysis of your own?

The exact ad tracking methods available to you will vary based on where you run your ads and which tools you're using, but here are a few basic types to keep in mind. It's important to note that the following ad tracking methods aren't mutually exclusive -- in fact, when used together they can provide even more powerful insights.</p> \n<h2>Technical Tracking Tools</h2> \n<p>When it comes to ad tracking, technical tools are a good place to start. These include options for tracking URLs from your website, ads placed in emails or sidebar displays or webpages and cookie-based tracking to unpack user behavior and fine-tune your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-plan-template-generator\">marketing plan</a>. Let’s explore each in more detail.</p> \n<h3>Tracking URLs</h3> \n<p>A tracking URL is a normal page URL from your website with a tracking token added to the end of it. Here's an example landing page URL by itself, and with a tracking token (in bold).</p> \n<p>Regular old landing page URL:</p> \n<p><code>http://www.yourwebsite.com/your-landing-page/</code></p> \n<p>Landing page URL with a tracking token:</p> \n<p><code>http://www.yourwebsite.com/your-landing-page/<strong>?utm_campaign=test-campaign&amp;utm_source=email</strong></code></p> \n<p>As you can see, the page URL is the same in both cases, but in the second case, there's some extra stuff added to the end. This extra stuff is your tracking token, also called a UTM parameter.</p> \n<p>So how does this \"extra stuff\" help you track things, exactly?</p> \n<p>When a user clicks on a URL with a UTM parameter added to the end, it essentially sends a signal back to your ad tracking tool that the URL was clicked. The \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">source=_____</span>\" bit of the tracking token can provide information about where the user clicked the link. Similarly, the \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">campaign=_____</span>\" bit can be used to signal to your tracking tool that the link should be bucketed as part of a campaign.</p> \n<p>For example, if you were to run the same ad on multiple websites and wanted to know which one generated the most clicks, you could define the two different websites as sources in the UTM parameters of your links.</p> \n<p>You can learn more about tracking parameters and how they work in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">this article</a>.</p> \n<h4>When to use tracking URLs:</h4> \n<p>If you're running a PPC campaign, sending an email, or putting an advertisement on another website, tracking URLs are ideal for calculating the number of visits, leads, and conversions you've generated from your hard work.</p> \n<h3>Tracking Pixels</h3> \n<p>A tracking pixel is a tiny, often transparent, 1px by 1px image that can be placed in an email, display ad, or simply on a webpage. When it loads, it sends a signal back to your tracking tool that a user has viewed the page.</p> \n<p>Tracking pixels are also capable of collecting pretty comprehensive data about a user's activity and browser configuration -- but you should only ever track information that is directly useful to your buyer's journey and will provide a better, more personalized experience for your target users.</p> \n<p>When used correctly, tracking pixels can help optimize your ads and get them in front of a receptive audience. For example, using banner ad tracking with a pixel lets you gather information about how many people just view versus actually click on your ad, which will help you determine whether or not an ad was actually successful (and worth running again).</p> \n<p>For context, here's how big a tracking pixel appears (no, that's not just a speck of dust on your screen):</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Google tracking pixel\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Ad%20Tracking%20What%20It%20Is%20%26%20How%20to%20Do%20It.png?width=400&amp;name=Ad%20Tracking%20What%20It%20Is%20%26%20How%20to%20Do%20It.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<h4>When to use tracking pixels:</h4> \n<p>Tracking pixels are incredibly useful for tracking the success of your online campaigns through every step of your conversion path. They can give you insight into how users are interacting with your ads, and help you optimize each stage of your user journey from initial touch through final purchase.</p> \n<h3>Cookies</h3> \n<p>Cookies can help you gain insight into user behavior on your website across multiple sessions of activity. Marketers need to gain explicit consent from users before using cookies to track their activity. When explicit consent is given, cookies can be used to customize a user's experience. Here's a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/what-is-cookie-tracking\">deeper dive on cookies</a> if you want to learn more about the technical aspects of how they function.</p> \n<p>From an ad tracking perspective, cookies are the driving force behind most ad retargeting campaigns. Cookies can be used to essentially build a user profile based on someone's web activity and habits, and advertisers can leverage this profile to serve ads that align with a user's observed interests. They can also capture information about a user's browser configuration, location, and preferred language.</p> \n<h4>When to use cookies:</h4> \n<p>Cookies are ideal when you want to serve a user ads aligned with their web browsing activity, or retarget them with ads for products they've demonstrated an interest in. Cookies can also be used to create a personalized experience for users on your website based on their previous interactions with you -- for example, you could create an abandoned cart email when users put items in their cart and then leave your website.</p> \n<p>Now that we've gone over a few core solutions related to ad targeting, let's take a deeper look at how ad targeting functions on a few of the biggest ad tracking platforms, and how you can use it to make your own ad campaigns stronger and more effective.</p> \n<h2>Search and Social Ad Tracking Solutions</h2> \n<p>Brands can also boost their ad tracking ability by using tools that integrate with search tools such as Google or social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. This type of ad tracking provides more in-depth information about user behaviors and preferences to help companies fine-tune their marketing efforts.</p> \n<h3>DoubleClick Ad Tracking</h3> \n<p>If you've ever noticed an ad for a product you viewed weeks ago following you around on the internet, it's likely the result of DoubleClick ad tracking. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/2727482?hl=en\">DoubleClick</a>, which was acquired by Google in 2008, is an ad management and ad serving platform that enables marketers to run ad campaigns across multiple channels.</p> \n<p>Online publishers use DoubleClick to essentially rent out ad space on their websites, and agencies and advertisers use the product to place ads on websites where their target audiences are spending time.</p> \n<p>In 2012, Google <a href=\"https://adexchanger.com/platforms/doubleclick-no-more-google-renames-its-ad-stack/\">rebranded</a> their DoubleClick products as Google Marketing Platform (formerly DoubleClick), Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords), and Google Ad Manager (formerly DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange).</p> \n<p>Google ad tracking offers advertisers a number of different options when they create campaigns on the platform -- most of which rely on the use of cookies.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2839090?hl=en\">According to Google</a>, \"Cookies themselves contain no personally identifiable information. Depending on the publisher’s and user’s settings, information associated with cookies used in advertising may be added to the user’s Google Account.\"</p> \n<p>These generic cookies can collect information on the time and date you viewed particular ads, the specific web pages you were on when you viewed an ad, and your IP address -- which can help the cookie infer where you're located.</p> \n<p>Although the cookies contain no personally identifiable information, <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/google/2019/02/05/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking/\">Google can combine</a> the information it obtains via cookies with the personally identifiable information associated with your Google Account (which includes your browsing and search activity when you're logged into Google -- which, for most of us, is pretty much always).</p> \n<p>Google leverages two main types of cookies: first-party and third-party.</p> \n<p>First-party cookies are dropped (i.e., assigned to a specific user) by the owner of the website you're visiting. Information collected via first-party cookies can help publishers better understand your activity on their site and how ads are performing.</p> \n<p>Third-party cookies are dropped by an advertiser on a website where their ads are being displayed. These cookies send information back to advertisers about how their ad campaigns are performing across all the websites where their DoubleClick ads are being displayed.</p> \n<p>Over <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Adsense\">11.1 million websites</a> currently run ads as part of Google's AdSense network. If you visit a website within the network, the information collected via a DoubleClick ad tracking cookie will be pooled and leveraged by other websites and advertisers using AdSense.</p> \n<p>This consolidation of cookie information results in an extremely rich pool of data for Google advertisers, as they can keep track of what ads you're served across millions of different websites.</p> \n<p>To get started tracking ads with Google, you'll need to <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/\">get a Google Marketing Platform account</a>. Depending on the size of your business and your particular needs, you'll choose either an enterprise account -- which can accommodate large ad campaigns across multiple websites and mediums -- or a small business account -- with ad tracking tools more focused and specialized for early company growth.</p> \n<h3>Facebook Pixel</h3> \n<p>Advertisers on Facebook can leverage a number of different ad tracking strategies to optimize ads for their audience. Facebook's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-pixel\">ad tracking pixel</a> is one of the more common methods for both desktop and mobile ad tracking. It functions similarly to the basic tracking pixel we outlined above, and can be used to track the path someone takes from viewing an ad, to visiting your website, to purchasing a product.</p> \n<p>When an action takes place on a page where a tracking pixel has been set up, the pixel will \"fire\" and send that information back to your Facebook Events Manager account. Information collected via the tracking pixel can also be used in the creation of custom audiences for future ad campaigns.</p> \n<p>For example, you could use data collected via a tracking pixel to create a custom ad audience targeting users who viewed a particular page on your website that implies purchase intent -- like a pricing page. We wrote an article that goes <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-pixel\">deeper into how the tracking pixel functions</a> if you want to learn more about different uses and how to set it up.</p> \n<p>Worth noting? Because Facebook owns Instagram, pixel works the same way on the photo-sharing site and will deliver the same type of insights. Collecting data from both Facebook and Instagram in tandem is a great way to pinpoint strategies that may work well on one platform but under-perform on the other. For example, longer text-driven ads may drive click-throughs on your Facebook page but fall flat on Instagram, where images drive interaction.</p> \n<h3>Additional Ad Tracking Options</h3> \n<p>While the Facebook pixel can offer advertisers valuable insights into how ads are influencing specific actions on their websites, it's not the only way to track ads on the social network.</p> \n<p>Another ad tracking option available to help improve <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ad-management-tools\">ad management</a> is adding UTM parameters to links that appear on your ads. As we discussed above, tracking parameters use extra code on a URL to \"fire\" when a user loads the link. On Facebook, they can <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1016122818401732\">be used</a> in Ads Manager to better understand which ads you're running are driving which types of traffic.</p> \n<h2>It All Adds Up: Improving Impact with Ad Tracking</h2> \n<p>Competitive Ad tracking can help your business see how your marketing efforts and campaigns are performing at scale. This starts with URL, pixel, and cookie tracking to explore how users are interacting with your brand. It’s bolstered by search-focused and social-focused tools that help your brand discover where ads are working, where they come up short, and where they need to improve to increase user engagement and drive sales conversions.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=46d72524-f4a7-44e9-9af0-935be9bb3891&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Improve your website with effective technical SEO.

Small business owners may lack the experience drawing up budgets; moreover, it's critical that these companies keep costs as low and lean as possible as they scale.</p> \n<p>Ironically, you need marketing to scale. Without it, it's hard to sell your products and services. In addition to the budgeting templates provided below, check out some of our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-content-creation-templates\">free offers</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-online-marketing-classes\">courses</a> to mitigate your company's marketing costs.</p> \n<p>Yet marketing budgets can be difficult to establish for companies of all sizes.</p> \n<h3>How much should a company spend on marketing?</h3> \n<p>Well, <a href=\"https://insights.digitalmediasolutions.com/articles/digital-spending-2020\">digital media makes up more than half</a> of both U.S. and global advertising spend. This includes initiatives that cater to audiences on desktop computers, search engines, video streaming platforms, social media, and mobile devices.</p> \n<p>Given the success marketers have seen in it, you might consider planning to spend at least half of your marketing budget on some of these digital channels.</p> \n<p>Let's talk about other ways to allocate your marketing budget.</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>As you build a budget, there are a few items you'll want to keep in mind when planning your marketing budget allocation.</p> \n<h3>Marketing Cost Examples</h3> \n<h4>1. Software</h4> \n<p>When it comes to digital and even print media, you may need software to create your marketing campaigns or handle your daily processes. There’s a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-tools\">marketing tool</a> for just about any task you can think of, but they are generally broken down into the following categories:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/benefits-of-crm\">Customer relationship management </a>(CRM)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/online-marketing-tools\">Online advertising</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-social-media-management-tools\">Social media</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\">Content creation</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/free-web-design-tools-2020\">design</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/event-marketing\">Event marketing</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-generation-tools\">Lead capture and lead generation</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-automation-information\">Marketing automation</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-analytics\">Data reporting and analytics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/digital-asset-management\">Digital asset management</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/collaboration-tools\">Team collaboration</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The costs of these tools can quickly add up, so it’s worth it to try out the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-tools\">free options</a> until you’re ready to commit to a tool your team loves.</p> \n<h4>2. Freelancers</h4> \n<p>If you have a temporary campaign or want to test out a new marketing strategy, you might want to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/find-manage-freelancers\">hire a short-term freelancer</a> before bringing on a full-timer.</p> \n<p>Reach out to your network for recommendations or consider using a site like UpWork. Freelancers typically charge an hourly rate, so be sure to examine your budget before hiring.</p> \n<h4>3. New Personnel</h4> \n<p>When you do hire full-time employees, you'll want to budget costs including their computer, technology, benefits, and onboarding-related needs. According to research from <a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/advice/cost-of-hiring-statistics-average-cost-per-hire/#Cost_Per_Hire_Demographic_Statistics\">Zippia</a>, the average cost of hiring a new employee is $4,425.</p> \n<h4>4. Advertising</h4> \n<p>Budget how much money you'll spend on paid opportunities such as physical ads, native ads, sponsored content, search engine ads, and social media promotions.</p> Most businesses will benefit from some form of online advertising whether via social media platforms, search engine, or native ads. \n<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/\">Statista</a> estimates there were an estimated 4.9 billion internet users worldwide as of 2021. If you’re not advertising online, you're missing out.\n<br> \n<h4>5. Content Creation</h4> \n<p>When you create content such as videos, photos, or even blog posts, you'll need to put paid time into it.</p> \n<p>Content marketing brings in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\">3X </a>as many leads as traditional options, so it’s worth dedicating funds to this area. Budget how much money will go into creating this content so you can adjust accordingly based on its return on investment.</p> \n<p>Now that you know more about what to include in your budget, let’s look at how to those funds are spent.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Marketing%20budget%20breakdown.jpg?width=650&amp;name=Marketing%20budget%20breakdown.jpg\" alt=\"Marketing budget breakdown\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" width=\"650\"><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/annual-cmo-spend-survey-research\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>If you’re not sure where to start with budget allocation, a good guideline to follow is the 70-20-10 rule. Using this as a benchmark:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>70% of your budget is allocated toward strategies you know work well</li> \n <li>20% of your budget is allocated toward new strategies aimed at helping you grow</li> \n <li>10% of your budget is allocated toward experimental strategies</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Marketing Cost Example</h3> \n<p>Let’s say your business has a marketing budget of $10,000. The budget allocation may look like this:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>$7,000 towards a CRM or other software you love, successful paid search campaigns, social media marketing</li> \n <li>$2,000 towards marketing a new product, feature, or service you’re testing</li> \n <li>$1,000 towards testing sponsored content</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Allocation by Channel</h3> \n<p>How you allocate your budget per channel depends on your company’s particular goals, so there is no hard and fast rule. However, the chart below from <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1222784/marketing-budget-share-channel/\">Statista</a> can give you a ballpark idea as it illustrates the share of marketing budgets from large companies across North America, the UK, Germany, and France.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Marketing%20budget%20by%20channel%20Statista.jpg?width=650&amp;name=Marketing%20budget%20by%20channel%20Statista.jpg\" alt=\"Marketing budget cost by channel \" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1222784/marketing-budget-share-channel/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Organized by channel, you can see that the top spots belong to social marketing, digital advertising, and search engine optimization (SEO).</p> \n<p>By 2023, it's estimated that marketers will spend more than <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/digital-ad-spending-outlook-blows-past-previous-forecasts\">$52 billion</a> on ads across websites or apps that are mainly eCommerce-focused. Let’s look at some examples of how these digital marketing costs apply to your budget.</p> \n<h4>Paid Search Advertising</h4> \n<p>You’re probably familiar with the ads at the top of a Google results page that show up above the list of search results. Those are a form of paid advertising called <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\">pay-per-click (PPC)</a>. You can <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/home/campaigns/search-ads/\">create and run ads on Google</a>, and each time someone clicks, you pay. The cost-per-click (CPC) can range anywhere from a few cents to a few dollars. You can use Google’s <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7337243\">keyword planner</a> to help estimate costs.</p> \n<p>With this method, you only pay for clicks you receive. So even if you’ve set aside a budget of $2,000, your campaign may only generate $1,500 worth of clicks.</p> \n<h4>Social Media</h4> \n<p>Like Google Ads, social media platforms have advertising programs based on the PPC model, but also charge by impressions. The CPC of running a paid social campaign varies depending on the platform of choice, but ranges from a few cents to a several dollars.</p> \n<p>Some companies may opt to hire an agency to run their campaigns and to create a social media strategy. Outsourcing this function is more expensive and can cost anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.digitalstand.com/blog/social-media-agency-charges\">$2,000 to $20,000</a> per month.</p> \n<h4>Content Marketing</h4> \n<p>Having a brand blog is a great way to get into content marketing, especially if you have in-house staff tasked with keeping it updated. Instead of a blog, you may be more interested in creating case studies, eBooks, videos or guides. They’re all designed to promote your brand and attract new customers.</p> \n<p>Content marketing costs vary widely based on what your goals are and area of focus. Hiring outside consultants or agencies to handle content marketing for you can range from <a href=\"https://www.webfx.com/content-marketing/pricing/\">$2,000 to $10,000</a> per month for small to medium-sized businesses. While it isn’t cheap, paying an agency to handle this task will free up your team’s time to work on other projects and may yield better results than going solo.</p> \n<h4>Email Marketing</h4> \n<p>Email marketing is a must-have for businesses, especially online retailers. With a customer acquisition rate <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide\">40X more effective</a> than Facebook and Twitter combined, it’s no surprise why this tried and true method is a staple in most marketing budgets. Email marketing also provides higher ROI as you’re connecting with people already interested in your brand.</p> \n<p>Email marketing costs depend on the size of your business, your goals, and chosen software or platform. Hiring an outside firm to handle these efforts will cost significantly more than doing it yourself.</p> \n<h4>Search Engine Optimization</h4> \n<p>SEO aids marketing efforts by improving your webpages so that they show up in search engines like Google. The more often your website comes up in search, the more potential customers will see it and hopefully visit your website.</p> \n<p>If you don’t have staff to handle your SEO needs in-house you may need to work with an agency. Depending on what your business needs are, this can cost thousands per month.</p> \n<p>While the marketing channel choices can seem endless, don't feel pressured to use all of them. Every business is different and you should prioritize putting funds toward the methods that best suit your needs.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>Spreadsheet knowledge <em>alone</em> won't help you understand how you'll spend your marketing money this year. Creating a sound marketing budget starts with knowing what purpose this budget will serve and which marketing teams it will represent.</p> \n<h3>1. Know your buyer's journey.</h3> \n<p>Your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buyer's journey</a> is the steps your audience takes as they 'journey' from prospect to paying customer. Knowing your buyer's journey allows you to understand how your audience interacts with your marketing — and where to set your goals <em>and</em> budget to better reach your customers.</p> \n<p>Ask yourself these questions as you define your buyer's journey:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How do your leads and customers typically discover your products?</li> \n <li>What do they need to know before they make a purchase?</li> \n <li>How many site visits do you see per month?</li> \n <li>How many leads are you generating per month, and how many of these convert to paying customers?</li> \n <li>What is the cost of generating new leads and then converting them to customers?</li> \n <li>What's the typical value/revenue of each lead?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>This process should point out what marketing tactics are (and aren't working), where you should alter your marketing goals, and where you can focus your marketing budget.</p> \n<h3>2. Align your budget with your marketing goals.</h3> \n<p>What you spend and where you spend it will depend on what you're trying to accomplish.</p> \n<p>So, when starting to create your marketing budget, make sure you're only spending money on the things required by your current marketing goals — goals set based on your audience and their journey from prospect to customer. These could include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Display ads <strong>to promote a new product</strong> you're launching this year.</li> \n <li>Sponsored social media posts <strong>to generate followers</strong> on your new Facebook page.</li> \n <li>Paid search engine ads <strong>to drive traffic (and purchases)</strong> to a specific product page.</li> \n <li>Contract bloggers <strong>to get more organic search traffic</strong> to your company's website.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Former Demand Generation Marketer at HubSpot and current Head of Marketing at Tailscale, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicacwebb\">Jessica Webb Kennedy</a>, says this about how your costs can change when focusing on lead generation vs. lead conversion: \"The majority of the money you spend on paid efforts is usually calculated based on the volume of clicks or impressions. Because of this, you'll often want to put more budget toward campaigns with higher-volume offers and audiences.\"</p> \n<p>\"For example, a tweet or Facebook ad promoting a lead generation offer that leans more top of the funnel will likely receive more clicks than something that falls more toward the middle or bottom of the funnel,\" she explains.</p> \n<p>Your paid advertising costs will also change depending on how wide of an audience you are attempting to reach.</p> \n<p>\"You can look at Twitter advertising as an example,\" Webb says. \"You have to option to target your campaigns based on users' interests or keywords searched for. Interests are a much broader category, whereas smaller pockets of users are searching for any given keyword, therefore your interests-based audience is going to be much larger and require a larger budget.\"</p> \n<h3>3. Beware of hidden marketing costs.</h3> \n<p>One of the great advantages to having and maintaining a budget spreadsheet is that it helps you avoid those end-of-the-quarter or end-of-the-year freak-outs when you realize, \"Whoa … what did I spend all that money on?\"</p> \n<p>In many cases, unanticipated costs can force marketers to fork over cash that they didn't plan on spending. Product marketing offers a perfect example. According to former HubSpot VP of Marketing and current CMO at The Wanderlust Group, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghankeaney\">Meghan Keaney Anderson</a>, it's easy to forget that successfully marketing your products and services requires more than just promotion.</p> \n<p>\"When people allocate budget for product marketing, they tend to think in terms of product launches and promotional activities,\" Anderson explains.</p> \n<p>\"That's certainly an important part of it, but another area of focus to remember is setting aside resources to conduct research and message testing long before the product ever goes to market. Having conversations with customers about the pain points your product will ultimately address is critical to shaping the messaging and having a successful launch.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Remember where your priorities lie.</h3> \n<p>Marketing is overflowing with add-ons and extras, upsells, and \"premium\" versions. One of the best ways to assess what's nice to have versus what's absolutely necessary is to (you guessed it) organize all of your expenses.</p> \n<p>By keeping tabs on where your budget is being allocated, and cross-checking that spending with the results you're getting, it will be much easier to figure out what should keep getting budget and what should get kicked to the curb.</p> \n<p>For example, let's look to the world of public relations. In PR, there are countless tools to which you can allocate budget, which could leave you overspending where it doesn't matter — and underspending where it does.</p> \n<p>\"Tools abound to help PR practitioners not only create and distribute great content and find and target key stakeholders, but to ultimately measure reach and effectiveness,\" says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanieleberle\">Nathaniel Eberle</a>, HubSpot's former Director of PR &amp; Brand and GoTo’s current VP of Global Brand &amp; Creative Management.</p> \n<p>\"The key is making sure you're laser-focused on who you're setting out to reach and influence, then ensuring that your budget supports how they'll most likely want to receive (and share) your key messages.</p> \n<p>\"As the media and digital landscape evolves at breakneck speed, continually reassessing the tools, services, and programs you're employing is a great way to determine real-time ROI of your overall spend. Today's measurement tool may be worthless to you tomorrow.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Spend your budget smartly.</h3> \n<p>When you open up these budget templates and check out all the various expenses detailed in them, don't fret if you can't tick every box. I'm not advocating for an \"always spend more\" approach to marketing.</p> \n<p>I'm advocating for an \"always spend smart\" approach. The expenses listed out aren't mandatory — they're just meant to guide your thinking and to help ensure that you haven't overlooked any hidden costs.</p> \n<h3>6. Prepare to measure ROI.</h3> \n<p>When you put a certain amount of money into a certain area, you'll want to determine if your budgeting helped you or hurt you as you plan out future budgets. The best way to do this is by measuring ROI — or return on investment.</p> \n<p>If the money you spend on one item results in your company making more in return, you may want to increase budget in the next year. If your money went nowhere, you should examine your budget.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>8 Marketing Budget Templates You Need to Manage Your Marketing Spend</h2> \n<p>With the <em>8 Free Budget Planner Templates to Manage Your Marketing Spend</em><em>,</em> you'll be able to manage all of the moving pieces of your budget at a monthly and quarterly level.</p> \n<p>Use the Excel version of the templates to keep all of your budgets in one place.

That's pretty much it, right?</p> \n<p>Wrong.</p> \n<p>For example, does the venue come with tables/chairs, or will you have to rent those separately? Do you want your attendees to wear name tags, and if so, will you be printing out the name tags ahead of time or will attendees be writing their own names on blank tags?</p> \n<p>If the latter, have you factored in the pens or markers you'll need to accommodate that?

Hint: There's no right answer — it'll depend on the market research you do to figure out where your specific audience spends most of its time.</p> \n<p>If you find your buyer prefers learning and consuming content in the form of video, for example, you might invest more of your money in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-video-advertising-guide\">YouTube advertising</a>.</p> \n<h3>Advertising Budget Example</h3> \n<p>Here's a small sample budget for a quarter's worth of expenses by a hypothetical company that has decided to invest heavily in video marketing. This template was created using the Master Budget Template, the first template listed in the section above.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sample-marketing-budget-1.jpg?width=650&amp;name=sample-marketing-budget-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sample marketing budget showing a video advertising investment that exceeds budget by $2,420.\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Based on the figures above, video advertising's total expenses for the quarter exceeded budget by $20, while full-time recruitment's total expenses exceeded budget by $2,400. This means the company is trending over budget for the first three months of the year.</p> \n<p>Why might this happen? Perhaps a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign on YouTube received more clicks by viewers than expected, and a sharp video-savvy job candidate negotiated a higher salary.</p> \n<p>Based on the difference between this company's planned spend and actual spend, their budget template produced the following graph:<br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sample-marketing-budget-graph.jpg?width=650&amp;name=sample-marketing-budget-graph.jpg\" alt=\"sample marketing budget graph\" width=\"650\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h2>Create a Marketing Budget That Prioritizes Your Goals</h2> \n<p>A well-thought out marketing budget serves as roadmap to your team's success.

A robust vetting process would help you avoid this costly mistake.</p> \n<p>However, it's not enough to come up with a process, you have to make sure it's inclusive, fair, and efficient. Let's show you how.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=c42148d7-13dd-4c38-b907-cff1602ee62f&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Click here to download our free guide to hiring and training a team of  all-stars [Free Ebook].\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c42148d7-13dd-4c38-b907-cff1602ee62f.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Hiring the wrong employee can cost companies hundreds of thousands of dollars. Back in 2016, The U.S. Department of Labor estimated this cost was close to 30% of the former employee's first-year earnings.</p> \n<p>Today, that figure could be even higher.</p> \n<p>Undoubtedly, recruiting and hiring candidates is an expensive and time-consuming process. This is on top of figuring out which candidates are <em>most</em> qualified to succeed at your company for the long haul.</p> \n<p>A vetting process should include a few critical elements. Let's cover how to run an effective vetting process that's efficient and free of bias as possible.</p> \n<h2>How long does the vetting process take?</h2> \n<p>The vetting process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks depending on what your process looks like, the seniority level for the role, and the industry.</p> \n<p>For instance, a role at the Federal Bureau of Investigation likely has a much longer vetting process than one at a SaaS company. The FBI likely conducts in-depth background checks beyond a candidate's criminal background whereas a SaaS company may focus the bulk of its vetting process on technical proficiency.</p> \n<p>Over time, your company will start compiling data on how long the process takes based on the factors mentioned above and build its strategy based on that.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Write an accurate job description.</h3> \n<p>Your vetting process will be easier start-to-finish if you take the time to write an accurate and compelling job description.</p> \n<p>I spoke to <a href=\"https://ie.linkedin.com/in/clairebmccarthy\">Claire McCarthy</a>, team lead in sales recruiting, who told me the job description can help both you and the candidate ensure a mutually beneficial fit from the start.</p> \n<p>\"We have pretty comprehensive job descriptions and we want candidates to take the time to read them and ensure the role is a good match for their background and skillset, as well as their long-term goals,\" she said.</p> \n<p>McCarthy adds that it's valuable to focus on attributes when creating your job description.</p> \n<p>\"For instance, for a sales role, we might list 'customer-first mentality' as a requirement,\" she said.</p> \n<p>In addition, craft your description to attract a wide pool of diverse applicants, since diverse teams perform better, and come up with more innovative ideas.</p> \n<p>This is important because a<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified\"> </a><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified\">Hewlett Packard internal report found</a> that women historically won't apply for a job unless they meet all the qualifications, while most men will apply if they meet only 60% of them.</p> \n<p>However, it doesn't only affect candidates from a gender perspective. Racism, ableism, and ageism can also impact the hiring process – and it all starts with your job description.</p> \n<p>To do so, you can rely on tools like <a href=\"https://textio.com/\">Textio</a>, which help you identify and remove implicit and explicit biased language from your job description.</p> \n<p>The goal is to use inclusive language that welcomes and attracts a diverse range of talent.</p> \n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-job-descriptions\">marketing job descriptions</a> you should recruit and hire to have an all-star team.</p> \n<h3>2. Leverage software to review candidates' application materials.</h3> \n<p>A vetting process should allow you to filter out candidates who don't have the skills necessary to succeed in the role. To do this, start by vetting the applicant's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-resume\">resume</a>, cover letter, and other application materials they've submitted for review.</p> \n<p>Additionally, a vetting process can support your diversity and inclusion initiative by ensuring your HR team remains fair and unbiased when evaluating potential candidates.</p> \n<p>For instance, you might implement a blind search system in which resumes are scanned by software, such as <a href=\"https://www.greenhouse.io/\">Greenhouse</a>.</p> \n<p>By ensuring your resumes are automatically sorted based on skill, you're circumventing some of the unintentional biases that might lead your HR employees to make unfair judgments.</p> \n<h3>3. Use video interviews prior to phone calls.</h3> \n<p>There are certain questions you can ask to decipher whether or not a candidate has the correct skills for the role.</p> \n<p>You don't want your recruiters spending valuable time on phone calls when you can just as easily collect that information another way.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, our hiring process includes video interviews, in which candidates must answer a series of questions and submit their recorded responses. The caveat here is that they must answer each question within a minute and they won't know what the questions are ahead of time.</p> \n<p>\"We do this for high volume roles, and use the video interview as a qualifier for whether or not the candidate moves forward with a phone interview,\" said McCarthy.</p> \n<p>Consider using video interviews to limit the amount of phone calls your HR team needs to make each day.</p> \n<h3>4. Evaluate candidates' qualifications using additional assessment tools.</h3> \n<p>To evaluate whether your candidate will succeed in the role, consider offering initial assessments.</p> \n<p>As a HubSpot writer, I was asked to write a blog post from scratch using one of HubSpot's prompt topics before being invited for an interview. This makes sense – why waste your time, and your candidate's time, if they don't have the skills you're looking for?</p> \n<p>From the candidate's perspective, it allows them to get a taste of what the role requires and show off why they're right for it.</p> \n<p>You might consider offering role plays for customer-facing positions, case studies for functional roles, or coding assessments for engineering positions.</p> \n<h3>5. Trust the process.</h3> \n<p>The point of having a process is to ensure consistency and promote fairness.</p> \n<p>This means across all tools and software you utilize just as much as the steps you follow.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a vetting process is only effective if it's consistent and replicable.</p> \n<p>\"A vetting process is about establishing a process at the beginning and sticking to it,\" said McCarthy. \"Additionally, it's important to use a vetting process to operationalize how we review candidates and decide which ones are most qualified to move forward to next steps.\"</p> \n<p>Using these five tactics will mitigate the time and money your HR team spends on recruitment in 2022 while ensuring you hire the best applicants – a win all around.</p> \n<em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in January 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.&nbsp;</em>\n<br> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=20fe7a4f-8bfb-4924-9046-ef5a2f3f3c33&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/20fe7a4f-8bfb-4924-9046-ef5a2f3f3c33.png\"></a> </p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvetting-process&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c42148d7-13dd-4c38-b907-cff1602ee62f.png","linkMd5":"30588118e842c8415a4177c0c867f8ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn44@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-05-897_83b23746ffd9fffb.webp","destWidth":840,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":8139,"destBytes":13774,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c42148d7-13dd-4c38-b907-cff1602ee62f.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn44@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-05-897_83b23746ffd9fffb.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/20fe7a4f-8bfb-4924-9046-ef5a2f3f3c33.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn28@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-10-558_e4e09f6d3d81a2f6.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvetting-process&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn94@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-10-346_cc5c7e20b7a48857.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245705083},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:05","title":"What Is Brand Perception? How to Measure It and 4 Examples","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-brand-perception","description":"<p>If you take a second to think about your shopping habits, you'll probably realize that a majority of the products you buy are influenced by brand perception. You're not the only one — <a href=\"https://learn.g2.com/branding-statistics\"><span>77% of B2C consumers</span></a> make purchasing decisions based solely on the brand name.</p>  \n<p>Brand perception, or the thoughts and feelings associated with a company, impacts why people wear a certain brand of clothing or pick one pasta sauce over another at the grocery store. Once consumers adopt an attitude about a brand, it's tough to change. That's why brands work hard to create positive associations in people's minds, rather than negative or neutral perceptions.</p> \n<p>When you know how people perceive your brand, it's easier to shape its reputation, help consumers understand what sets it apart, and develop brand equity. You do this by measuring brand perception and tracking customer sentiment over time.</p> \n<p>But before diving into the metrics, it's important to understand what creates brand perception and how it informs company and consumer decision-making.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Brand Building Guide\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>What is brand perception?</h2> \n<p>Brand perception is the sum of a consumer's feelings, experiences, and thoughts about a product or service. It's what people believe a brand represents, rather than what a brand says it represents.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brand%20perception-v1.jpg?width=1794&amp;name=brand%20perception-v1.jpg\" alt=\"How to Understand the Value of Brand perception\" width=\"1794\" style=\"width: 1794px;\"></p> \n<p>Although brand perception is a mental association, it plays an essential role in creating emotional connections with consumers. People consider their attitude toward brands when choosing between competing products. They read reviews, chat with customer support, compare options with friends, or sign up for a free trial. All of these touchpoints affect brand perception and impact a company's success.</p> \n<p>If consumers think highly of a brand, they become more loyal to it. Consider how this dynamic plays out in everyday life. People get in meme wars over <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+vs+android+meme&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiT_ryuu_r0AhVKaM0KHf2QAxcQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1423&amp;bih=741&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=QFWJsh5kwFIW0M\"><span>Apple versus Android</span></a> products. A person who wears Nike shoes usually won't be caught in Adidas kicks. And you probably won't find Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the same fridge.</p> \n<p>Companies that understand brand perception use this information to develop <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-equity\"><span>brand equity</span></a>. While brand perception can be narrowed down to what one customer thinks about your brand, brand equity is the combination of people's perceptions, experiences, and opinions that creates your reputation. A company with high brand equity attracts loyal customers who pick your product or service when given the choice between competitors.</p> \n<p>When a customer is <a href=\"https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/11/customer-loyalty-survey.html\"><span>loyal to a brand</span></a>, 86% will recommend it to friends or family and 66% are likely to write a positive review. Those actions drive company growth and improve brand perception, which only helps your business.</p> \n<p>Although it may seem that brand perception is out of your hands, you can take steps to measure it and improve people's attitudes.</p> \n<h2>How to Measure Brand Perception</h2> \n<p>Data can help you understand how consumers, employees, stakeholders, and competitors perceive your brand. Since brand perception is a combination of reviews, reputation, experience, functionality, advertising, social engagement, and customer use, you should gather metrics from multiple sources.</p> \n<p>Here's how to measure brand perception:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Conduct brand perception surveys</strong> to learn what people think of your business and how it stacks up against competitors. Ask questions that touch on emotional, cognitive, and action-oriented factors, such as these examples from <a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/experience-management/brand/perception-surveys/\"><span>Qualtrics</span></a>: \n  <ul> \n   <li>When you think of [the brand], what comes to mind first?</li> \n   <li>Which of the following words describe [the brand]?</li> \n   <li>What kind of feelings do you experience when you think of [the brand]?</li> \n   <li>How would you describe your level of emotional attachment to [the brand]?</li> \n   <li>How would you describe [the brand] to a friend?</li> \n   <li>How would you describe your last experience with [the brand]?</li> \n   <li>On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend [the brand] to a friend or colleague?</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li><strong>Track online mentions</strong> using <a href=\"https://info.campussonar.com/social-listening-basics\">social listening</a> tools or Google alerts. You want to monitor social media comments, online reviews, relevant hashtags, forums (i.e. Reddit and Quora), and news mentions. As the brand grows, so will this dataset. I recommend creating a system to handle negative mentions as soon as possible and stay on top of talk about your brand, products, and marketing campaigns.</li> \n <li><strong>Do a brand audit</strong> to evaluate how your brand perception compares to competitors'. This should include research on primary and secondary target audiences, a competitive analysis of your products or services, a thorough evaluation of your communications strategy, and a deep dive into your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/brand-positioning-strategy\"><span>brand positioning</span></a>. (I recommend referencing this brand audit guide from <a href=\"https://visme.co/blog/brand-audit/\"><span>Visme</span></a>).</li> \n <li><strong>Collect data from customers</strong> at each point of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\"><span>buyer's journey</span></a>. This can include how buyers research information, evaluate products, compare between competitors, interact with customer support, make a purchase decision, onboard, and interact with the brand post-purchase.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you have enough data to measure brand perception, you can evaluate if consumer sentiment aligns with your brand identity. If so, stay the course. If not, you can learn how to improve <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/improve-customer-perception\"><span>consumer brand perception</span></a>.</p> \n<h2>Brand Perception Examples</h2> \n<p>From PR campaigns to packaging, brand perception is influenced by every touchpoint people have with a company. The following brand perception examples show how businesses can shape consumer sentiments so the inner identity matches the outer image.</p> \n<h3>1. Snickers</h3> \n<p>Candy lovers can choose between dozens of chocolate-covered bars, so what makes someone grab a Snickers instead of a Kit Kat? Yes, it may be taste or preference, but the brand has designed clever campaigns to make people believe that eating Snickers will transform you from hangry and unfocused to sharp and satisfied.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZdvFTgmeo0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h3>2. Orangetheory</h3> \n<p>You may have driven past one of these orange-hued workout studios on your daily commute or taken an online class during the pandemic. And while fitness crazes come and go, Orangetheory has carved out a brand perception that's kept the company going strong since 2010. The community-oriented classes make it the right fit for people looking to connect and compete with neighbors while working up a sweat. It's more casual than Crossfit but kicks up the intensity compared to group classes at national gyms, like Planet Fitness and LA Fitness.<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ME__19BmV3Gala0b9NqcYZWJKV0IlAbLZL9yAnJuGUhHivg3UmUYK1DhiqTHmySWmdOhbnQ4STomwJRFff8Pxigjmpi6HvcWyAR3WY7kYZnpUMAswU3pCECqqMobzxwCeP76S2gA\" width=\"455\" height=\"546\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Orange Theory Fitness Brand Perception\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://tombras.com/campaign/orangetheory-fitness\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>3. Zoom</h3> \n<p>An innovative and beloved video platform at the start of the pandemic, Zoom quickly became the cause of remote workers' burnout. People loved how it kept them connected to teams, families, and friends.</p> \n<p>But the constant connection led to \"Zoom fatigue,\" an informal diagnosis that's been covered by Healthline, <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/\"><span>Stanford</span></a>, the New York Times, and more. While companies still rely on Zoom for virtual meetings, the brand has had to adjust from its original \"Video conferencing that doesn't suck\" vibe to \"How the world connects\" as <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/zoom-launches-ad-campaign-aiming-keep-growing-beyond-pandemic/2364921\"><span>consumers shifted their perceptions</span></a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Zoom-Meetings.jpg?width=624&amp;name=Zoom-Meetings.jpg\" alt=\"Zoom fatigue meme: 1st day of Zoom meetings vs. 14th day of Zoom meetings\" width=\"624\" style=\"width: 624px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.remote.tools/memes/zoom-memes\"><span>Image Source</span></a></p> \n<h3>4. Patagonia</h3> \n<p>The outdoor gear brand became famous for its innovative clothing and focus on responsible manufacturing, but a change in consumer perception caused the company to double down on its sustainability-driven identity.</p> \n<p>In the early 2010s, people began referring to the company as Patagucci — a satirical name that poked fun at the brand's high prices and its adoption among high-income workers. To sway consumers from placing Patagonia in the fast-fashion category, the company has launched a number of sustainability-focused initiatives, like its Worn Wear line of recycled clothing.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cMgfVenLRSI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Knowing what people think of your brand is an important part of developing a successful business. It gives you the information you need to shape your brand identity, create impactful marketing campaigns, and make changes when consumer perception shifts.</p> \n<p>Now that you know how to measure brand perception, you can use it as a tool to make strategic brand decisions and drive your company forward.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\"
