Now, Indigenous people are exploring how this type of study can be conducted in a way that respects their people and traditions. Meagan Cantwell talks with contributing correspondent Lizzie Wade about a summer workshop for Indigenous scientists that aims to start a new chapter in genomics.\n\nWe’ve known for decades that PCBs—polychlorinated biphenyls—are toxic and carcinogenic. In the 1970s and 1980s, these compounds were phased out of use in industrial and electronic applications, worldwide. But they are still in the environment—in soil and air—and in animal tissues, particularly those of killer whales. These toxic compounds start out at minute levels in tiny organisms, but as the small are eaten by the slightly larger, the PCB concentration increases—from plankton, to fish, to seals—until you are at killer whales with PCB-packed blubber. Ailsa Hall, director of the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St. Andrews University in the United Kingdom, talks with host Sarah Crespi about her group’s work measuring PCB levels in different killer whale populations and calculating the effect of PCBs on those populations 100 years from now.\n\nIn this month’s book segment, Jen Golbeck interviews Damon Centola about his book How Behavior Spreads: The Science of Complex Contagions.

Researchers have published dozens of papers exploring the unique microorganisms that thrive in this area, while at the same time fighting large agricultural industries draining the precious water from the pools.\n\nDavid Tatnell, a postgraduate researcher at the University of Exeter, talks with host Sarah Crespi about using heat to make sound, a phenomenon known as thermoacoustics. Just like the sound of fire or thunder, sudden changes in temperature can create sound waves. In his team’s paper in Science Advances, Tatnell and colleagues describe a thermoacoustic speaker that uses thin, heated films to make sound. This approach cuts out the crosstalk seen in mechanical speakers and allows for extreme miniaturization of sound production. In the ultrasound range, arrays of thermoacoustic speakers could improve acoustic levitation and ultrasound imaging. In the hearing range, the speakers could be made extremely small, flexible, and even transparent.\n\nThis week’s episode was produced with help from Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF)\n\n[Image: David Jaramillo; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f7c23c5103ecd7a1e6473d9fbca5f257","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/de9846a5-714a-4ead-adf7-abec0116e7f5/audio.mp3","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105895},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Better hurricane forecasts and spotting salts on Jupiter’s moon Europa","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/0316b7ad-d022-4829-a441-aaea0177641d/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"We’ve all seen images or animations of hurricanes that color code the wind speeds inside the whirling mass—but it turns out we can do a better job measuring these winds and, as a result, better predict the path of the storm.

Sarah Crespi talks with Online News Editor Catherine Matacic about a “control” study using what might be a comparably stressful experience here on Earth: climbing Mount Everest.\n\nCatherine also shares a recent study that confirmed what one reddit user posted 5 years ago: A single path stretching from southern Pakistan to northeastern Russia will take you on the longest straight-line journey on Earth, via the ocean.\n\nFinally, Sarah talks with Roland Kröger of the University of York in the United Kingdom about his group’s study published this week in Science. Using a combination of techniques usually reserved for materials science, the group explored the nanoscale arrangement of mineral in bone, looking for an explanation of the tissue’s contradictory combination of toughness and hardness.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\n[Image: Human bone (20X) by Berkshire Community College Bioscience Image Library; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 May 2018 19:15:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"969ac6119836c82c5f6cb8677a4aed1c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/5979c54e-da12-43f6-82d4-aaea0177b10b/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105900},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Mysteriously male crocodiles, the future of negotiating AIs, and atomic bonding between the United States and China","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/f15fe65b-ed1b-42ad-b544-aaea01782754/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week we hear stories on involving more AIs in negotiations, tiny algae that might be responsible for killing some (not all) dinosaurs, and a chemical intended to make farm fish grow faster that may be also be causing one area’s crocodile population to skew male—with Online News Editor David Grimm.  \n\nSarah Crespi talks to Rich Stone about being on the scene for a joint U.S.-China mission to remove bomb-grade fuel from a nuclear reactor in Ghana.  \n\nListen to previous podcasts.   \n\n[Image:Chad Sparkes; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"59f7873730b70b01c2af1ba0402ad505","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/f15fe65b-ed1b-42ad-b544-aaea01782754/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105901},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: Tracking Zika, the evolution of sign language, and changing hearts and minds with social science","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/8bfce046-2fc4-49cf-ac9c-aaea01792b2a/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Online news editor Catherine Matacic shares stories on the evolution of sign language, short conversations than can change minds on social issues, and finding the one-in-a-million people who seem to be resistant to certain genetic diseases—even if they carry genes for them.\n \nNuno Faria joins host Sarah Crespi to explain how genomic analysis can track Zika’s entry date into Brazil and follow its spread.  \n \n[Image: r.a. olea/Flickr]","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 17:59:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"34b40396e80b1bc53b4f4a7eaeb46a78","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/8bfce046-2fc4-49cf-ac9c-aaea01792b2a/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105903},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Breeding better bees, and training artificial intelligence on emotional imagery","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/8d891abe-e979-4abe-8a96-aaea01776083/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Imagine having a rat clinging to your back, sucking out your fat stores.

Plus,Science's Emily Underwood wades into the muddled world of migraine research, and Jessica Metcalf talks about using modern microbial means to track mammalian decomposition.\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 08 Jan 2016 16:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0b06de525d277bff772b6f29d9be4869","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/44bb7e11-6485-473d-bf73-aaea01793a56/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105903},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Engineering global health and a news roundup (12 September 2014) ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/4181dca8-668b-49e7-931c-aaea017abe38/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Frugal engineering for global health; roundup of daily news.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ee32de6761440723ccbae1e65b9fdbdf","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/4181dca8-668b-49e7-931c-aaea017abe38/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105905},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Mind reading and a news roundup (20 Jun 2014) ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d67c492f-ee41-464e-9978-aaea017ad3e7/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Learning to read minds; roundup of daily news with David Grimm.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6297aedd0f0f1e8418309827a9d6cf9b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d67c492f-ee41-464e-9978-aaea017ad3e7/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105906},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Probing the secrets of the feline mind and how Uber and Lyft may be making traffic worse","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/741dedfe-34b1-4bd7-b560-aaea01776cd0/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Dog cognition and social behavior have hogged the scientific limelight for years—showing in study after study that canines have social skills essential to their relationships with people. Cats, not so much. These often-fractious felines tend to balk at strange situations—be they laboratories, MRI machines, or even a slightly noisy fan. Online News Editor David Grimm joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss several brave research labs that have started to work with cats on their terms in order to show they have social smarts comparable to dogs. So far, the results suggest that despite their different ancestors and paths to domestication, cats and dogs have a lot more in common then we previously thought.\n\nAlso this week, host Meagan Cantwell speaks with Greg Erhardt, assistant professor of civil engineering at University of Kentucky in Lexington about the effect of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft on traffic in San Francisco, California. His group’s work showed that when comparing 2010 and 2016 traffic, these services contributed significantly to increases in congestion in a large growing city like San Francisco, but questions still remain about how much can be generalized to other cities or lower density areas.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF) \n\nAds on this show: KiwiCo\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Thomas Hawk/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 May 2019 18:30:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"db472d0bac06f99343b1fb1784470030","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/741dedfe-34b1-4bd7-b560-aaea01776cd0/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: Babylonian astronomers, doubly domesticated cats, and outrunning a T.

Science News Writer Daniel Clery joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss the blazar fingered as the source and how neutrinos from this gigantic matter-gobbling black hole could help astronomers learn more about mysterious high-energy cosmic rays that occasionally shriek toward Earth.\n\nRead the research.\n\nSarah also talks with Cornell University’s Susan McCouch about her team’s work on deep-water rice. Rice can survive flooding by fast internodal growth—basically a quick growth spurt that raises its leaves above water. But this growth only occurs in prolonged, deep flooding. How do these plants know they are submerged and how much to grow? Sarah and Susan discuss the mechanisms involved and where they originated.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\n[Image: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b77acb01e5d6136e98f96200d0d42a17","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/58aebf7f-b2f0-4be5-a218-aaea01779d44/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105900},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Evolution of skin color, taming rice thrice, and peering into baby brains ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/1eab0cb4-41de-47f4-ab72-aaea01781ea4/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week we hear stories about a new brain imaging technique for newborns, recently uncovered evidence on rice domestication on three continents, and why Canada geese might be migrating into cities, with Online News Editor David Grimm.  \n\nSarah Crespi interviews Sarah Tishkoff of the University of Pennsylvania about the age and diversity of genes related to skin pigment in African genomes.  \n\nListen to previous podcasts.  \n\n[Image: Danny Chapman/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:30:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2f23982087890f74c56c44d92f60f915","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/1eab0cb4-41de-47f4-ab72-aaea01781ea4/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105901},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Earthquakes caused by too much water extraction, and a dog cancer that has lived for millennia","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/dfdb0ee6-d3cd-42d8-8a33-aaea01775ed3/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"After two mysterious earthquake swarms occurred under the Sea of Galilee, researchers found a relationship between these small quakes and the excessive extraction of groundwater.

Contributing Correspondent Lizzie Wade joins host Sarah Crespi to talk about a new study that used tree rings to calibrate radiocarbon readings—and get closer to pinning down a date. The findings also suggest that scientists may need to change their standard radiocarbon dating calibration curve.\n\nSarah also talks to Tony Belpaeme of Ghent University in Belgium and Plymouth University in the United Kingdom about his Science Robotics paper that explored whether people are susceptible to peer pressure from robots. Using a classic psychological measure of peer influence, the team found that kids from ages 7 to 9 occasionally gave in to social pressure from robot peers, but adults did not.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy, with help from Meagan Cantwell.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Softbank Robotics; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1fd31889c5f00b7e0006ba5dac1e717f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/213cd6b6-3446-44d1-882b-aaea01779ad1/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"DNA and proteins from ancient books, music made from data, and the keys to poverty traps","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/010a44c1-9529-4a90-949d-aaea0178280f/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week we hear stories on turning data sets into symphonies for business and pleasure, why so much of the world is stuck in the poverty trap, and calls for stiffening statistical significance with Online News Editor David Grimm.\n\nSarah Crespi talks to news writer Ann Gibbons about the biology of ancient books—what can we learn from DNA, proteins, and book worm trails about a book, its scribes, and its readers?\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\n[Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"942c9c0f598a867938f5af69bc8f344d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/010a44c1-9529-4a90-949d-aaea0178280f/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105901},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"The places where HIV shows no sign of ending, and the parts of the human brain that are bigger—in bigger brains","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/def730c7-f8fe-44a9-87d3-aaea0177a4dc/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Nigeria, Russia, and Florida seem like an odd set, but they all have one thing in common: growing caseloads of HIV.

Adult human brains can vary as much as two times in size—and until now this expansion was thought to be evenly distributed.

Spectrum staff reporter Hannah Furfaro joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss the history of fragile X in the town of Ricaurte and the future of the people who live there.\n\nAlso this week, we talk about greening up grass. Lawns of green grass pervade urban areas all around the world, regardless of climate, but the cost of maintaining them may outweigh their benefits. Host Meagan Cantwell talks with Maria Ignatieva of The University of Western Australia in Perth and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala about how lawns can be transformed to contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Adam Kerfoot-Roberts/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5c3a8e4dfe1fd6c8ce0ab29f7a096780","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/4e467635-333e-4086-8891-aaea01779190/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: Glowing robot skin, zombie frogs, and viral fossils in our DNA","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/ac77a502-91b9-48ef-99ce-aaea01792fad/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Online News Editor David Grimm shares stories on zombification by a frog-killing fungus, relating the cosmological constant to life in the universe, and ancient viral genes that protect us from illness.\n \nChris Larson joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss a new type of robot skin that can stretch and glow.\n \n[Image: Jungbae Park]","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Mar 2016 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5a79008e6a09bbe3ae9c17a7d0da0a04","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/ac77a502-91b9-48ef-99ce-aaea01792fad/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105903},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Building a landslide observatory, and the universality of music","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/b8e990ae-9aa1-4aa8-b182-ab0c015f7cbe/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"You may have seen the aftermath of a landslide, driving along a twisty mountain road—a scattering of rocks and scree impinging on the pavement. And up until now, that’s pretty much how scientists have tracked landslides—roadside observations and spotty satellite images. Now, researchers are hoping to track landslides systematically by instrumenting an entire national park in Taiwan. The park is riddled with landslides—so much so that visitors wear helmets. Host Sarah Crespi talks with one of those visitors—freelance science journalist Katherine Kornei—about what we can learn from landslides.\n\nIn a second rocking segment, Sarah also talks with Manvir Singh about the universality of music. His team asked the big questions in a Science paper out this week: Do all societies make music? What are the common elements that can be picked out from songs worldwide? Sarah and Manvir listen to songs and talk about what love ballads and lullabies have in common, regardless of their culture of origin.\n\nExplore the music database. \n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this week’s show: Bayer; KiwiCo; McDonalds\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Martin Lewinson/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:30:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c75b79c290e047a356ea688539b02576","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/b8e990ae-9aa1-4aa8-b182-ab0c015f7cbe/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Building brain-like computers (8 Aug 2014) ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/117d72d0-6064-43a7-9aea-aaea017ac342/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"A new class of gamma ray sources; roundup of daily news.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 08 Aug 2014 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6610f10f12ae631ccf382db8bf45cc18","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/117d72d0-6064-43a7-9aea-aaea017ac342/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105905},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Science Podcast - Climate and corn and a news roundup (2 May 2014) ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/706b75c1-7e9e-4023-a174-aaea017ad24e/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Climate and crops; roundup of daily news with David Grimm.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 May 2014 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1b4ac07267f2198e23afc2021f1a3eb8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/706b75c1-7e9e-4023-a174-aaea017ad24e/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105905},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"How humans survived an ancient volcanic winter and how disgust shapes ecosystems","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/790a423f-4216-4867-bfeb-aaea0177bdf1/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"When Indonesia’s Mount Toba blew its top some 74,000 years ago, an apocalyptic scenario ensued: Tons of ash and debris entered the atmosphere, coating the planet in ash for 2 weeks straight and sending global temperatures plummeting. Despite the worldwide destruction, humans survived. Sarah Crespi talks with Online News Editor Catherine Matacic about how life after Toba was even possible—were humans decimated, or did they rally in the face of a suddenly extra hostile planet?\n\nNext, Julia Buck of the University of California, Santa Barbara, joins Sarah to discuss her Science commentary piece on landscapes of disgust. You may have heard of a landscape of fear—how a predator can influence an ecosystem not just by eating its prey, but also by introducing fear into the system, changing the behavior of many organisms. Buck and colleagues write about how disgust can operate in a similar way: Animals protect themselves from parasites and infection by avoiding disgusting things such as dead animals of the same species or those with disease.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\n[Image: Emma Forsber/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 18:15:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a29409bc75674d17841e3fffc302e15e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/790a423f-4216-4867-bfeb-aaea0177bdf1/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105900},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Animals that don’t need people to be domesticated; the astonishing spread of false news; and links between gender, sexual orientation, and speech","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d5586074-381d-4fe8-9a37-aaea0177be01/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Did people domesticate animals?

He finds that false news travels further, deeper, and faster than true news, regardless of the source of the tweet, the kind of news it was, or whether bots were involved.\n\nIn a bonus segment recording during a live podcasting event at the AAAS Annual Meeting in Austin, Sarah first speaks with Ben Munson of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis about markers of gender and sexual orientation in spoken language and then Adrienne Hancock of The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., talks about using what we know about gender and communication to help transgender women change their speech and communication style.

Online News Editor David Grimm talks with Sarah Crespi about reporting on this story and what it says about the history of dog domestication.\n\nSarah also interviews physicist Brad Marston of Brown University on surprising findings that bring together planetary science and quantum physics. It turns out that Earth’s rotation and the presence of oceans and atmosphere on its surface mean it can be described as a “topological insulator”—a term usually reserved for quantum phenomena. Insights from the study of these effects at the quantum level may help us understand weather and currents at the planetary level—including insights into climate change and exoplanets.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a85a8f4039f2b6a8ebb85f7a9e0f1a09","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/538e21c8-9b20-4179-bd85-aaea01781c45/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105901},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Preventing augmented-reality overload, fixing bone with tiny bubbles, and studying human migrations ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d537ce1f-a657-4da7-ac8e-aaea017833a6/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week we have stories on blocking dangerous or annoying distractions in augmented reality, gene therapy applied with ultrasound to heal bone breaks, and giving robots geckolike gripping power with Online News Editor David Grimm.\n\nDeputy News Editor Elizabeth Culotta joins Sarah Crespi to discuss a special package on human migrations—from the ancient origins of Europeans to the restless and wandering scientists of today.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nDownload the show transcript.\n\nTranscripts courtesy of Scribie.com.\n\n[Image: Public domain; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 May 2017 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f1792016686dbacf23d00f92f5ac7a7b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d537ce1f-a657-4da7-ac8e-aaea017833a6/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105902},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: Bringing back tomato flavor genes, linking pollution and dementia, and when giant otters roamed Earth ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/56350f4a-59fe-4da4-996d-aaea0178f56f/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week, we chat about  50-kilogram otters that once stalked southern China, using baseball stats to show how  jet lag puts players off their game, and a growing link between pollution and dementia, with Online News Editor David Grimm.

Science journalist Sara Talpos talks with host Meagan Cantwell about how locals found the potentially health-harming chemicals in their water, and how contamination from nonstick chemicals isn’t limited to Michigan.\n\nAlso this week, host Sarah Crespi talks with Shyamnath Gollakota of the University of Washington in Seattle about his work diagnosing ear infections with smartphones. With the right app and a small paper cone, it turns out that your phone can listen for excess fluid in the ear by bouncing quiet clicks from the speaker off the eardrum. Clinical testing shows the setup is simple to use and can help parents and doctors check children for this common infection.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this show: Science Rules! podcast with Bill Nye\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF) \n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Dennis Wise/University of Washington; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 May 2019 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"48e1db9142ef1022184ad7398734db40","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/8a4d7150-3e7a-421a-86b8-aaea01776c64/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Legendary Viking crystals, and how to put an octopus to sleep","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/110a73bb-5aad-4712-b762-aaea0177bdc1/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"A millennium ago, Viking navigators may have used crystals known as “sunstones” to navigate between Norway and Greenland.

Now, researchers analyzing radar data from the Mars Express mission have found evidence for an enormous salty lake under the southern polar ice cap of Mars. Daniel Clery joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss how the water was found and how it can still be liquid—despite temperatures and pressures typically inhospitable to water in its liquid form.\n\nRead the research.\n\nSarah also talks with science journalist Katherine Kornei about her story on changing athletic performance after gender transition. The feature profiles researcher Joanna Harper on the work she has done to understand the impacts of hormone replacement therapy and testosterone levels in transgender women involved in running and other sports. It turns out within a year of beginning hormone replacement therapy, transgender women plateau at their new performance level and stay in a similar rank with respect to the top performers in the sport. Her work has influenced sports oversight bodies like the International Olympic Committee.\n\nIn this month’s book segment, Jen Golbeck interviews Andrew Lawler about his book The Secret Token: Myth, Obsession, and the Search for the Lost Colony of Roanoke.\n\nNext month’s book will be The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie.

New research reveals that in the lining of the esophagus, mutant cells run rampant, fighting for dominance over normal cells. But they do this without causing any detectable damage or cancer.

Online News Editor David Grimm joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss recently penned legislation that pushes for monkey retirements and a new collaboration between universities and sanctuaries to create a retirement pipeline for these primates.\n\nSarah also talks with Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for NASA’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) and a professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson, about the latest news from the asteroid Bennu. Within 1 week of beginning its orbit of the asteroid, OSIRIS-REx was able to send back surprising images of the asteroid ejecting material. It’s extremely rocky surface also took researchers by surprise and forced a recalculation of the sample return portion of the craft’s mission.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this week’s show: McDonalds; Parcast’s Natural Disasters podcast; KiwiCo\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 19:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a41f7166571245471f049daa973eab25","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/e4f220b6-0d05-4b45-9d4f-ab1a014d7301/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105895},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: Reading pain from the brains of infants, modeling digital faces, and wifi holograms","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/011714ea-57a3-4540-837a-aaea0178e87d/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week, we discuss the most accurate digital model of a human face to date, stray Wi-Fi signals that can be used to spy on a closed room, and artificial intelligence that can predict Supreme Court decisions with Online News Editor Catherine Matacic.\n\nCaroline Hartley joins Sarah Crespi to discuss a scan that can detect pain in babies—a useful tool when they can’t tell you whether something really hurts.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nSee more book segments.\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 04 May 2017 18:15:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"16e421d5a4f6cb43c00983ab793c4636","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/011714ea-57a3-4540-837a-aaea0178e87d/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105902},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Science in Cuba and a news roundup","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/4701944b-f115-4304-bddd-aaea017a96fb/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Richard Stone discusses science in Cuba: isolation, innovation, and future partnerships, and David Grimm discusses daily news stories.

But in the past decade researchers have started to look elsewhere in the body for clues to this debilitating disease—particularly in the gut. Host Meagan Cantwell talks with Viviane Labrie of the Van Andel Institute in Grand Rapids, Michigan, about new research suggesting people without their appendixes have a reduced risk of Parkinson’s. Labrie also describes the possible mechanism behind this connection.\n\nAnd host Sarah Crespi talks with Peter Fratzl of the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam, Germany, about what materials scientists can learn from nature. The natural world might not produce innovations like carbon nanotubes, but evolution has forged innumerable materials from very limited resources—mostly sugars, proteins, and minerals. Fratzl discusses how plants make time-release seedpods that are triggered by nothing but fire and rain, the amazing suckerin protein that comprises squid teeth, and how cicadas make their transparent, self-cleaning wings from simple building blocks.\n\nFratzl’s review is part of a special section in Science on composite materials.

Using these data, researchers were able to compare wind patterns on Saturn and Jupiter and measure the mass and age of Saturn’s rings. It turns out the rings are young, relatively speaking—they may have formed as recently as 10 million years ago, after dinosaurs went extinct.\n\nMegan Cantwell then talks to science writer Laura Spinney about how researchers are fighting conspiracy theories and political manipulation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the country’s ongoing Ebola outbreak. In a first, the government, nongovernmental organizations, and scientists are working with community leaders to fight misinformation—and they might actually be winning.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Stuart Rankin; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 20:15:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e44e6942be9c4b66c2f64e6ae820e237","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/6c72e052-348c-4063-bbb1-aaea01778045/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105897},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"The youngest sex chromosomes on the block, and how to test a Zika vaccine without Zika cases","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/2efd219e-3c9c-4cd1-862c-aaea0177946b/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Strawberries had both male and female parts, like most plants, until several million years ago. This may seem like a long time ago, but it actually means strawberries have some of the youngest sex chromosomes around. What are the advantages of splitting a species into two sexes? Host Sarah Crespi interviews freelance journalist Carol Cruzan Morton about her story on scientists’ journey to understanding the strawberry’s sexual awakening.\n\nIn 2016, experimental Zika vaccines were swiftly developed in response to the emergence of serious birth defects in the babies of infected woman. Two years after the height of Zika cases, there’s so little spread of the virus in the Americas that it has stymied vaccine trials. Researchers hope to overcome this hurdle with “human challenge experiments”—vaccinating people, then intentionally infecting them with Zika to see whether they’re protected from the virus. Meagan Cantwell talks with staff writer Jon Cohen about his news story that highlights the risks and rewards of human challenge experiments.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Public domain; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"baa80bb9085c9d892ca5fd42a26064c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/2efd219e-3c9c-4cd1-862c-aaea0177946b/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Artificial intelligence programs that learn concepts based on just a few examples and a daily news roundup","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/f852ade5-3c89-49e6-b187-aaea017938dc/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Brenden Lake discusses a new computational model that rivals the human ability to learn new concepts based on just a single example; David Grimm talks about attracting cockroaches, searching for habitable planets, and looking to street dogs to learn about domestication.

As many as 100,000 people die from the disease each year. For those who survive infection, the virus leaves a lasting mark—it appears to wipe out the immune system’s memory. News Intern Eva Fredrick joins host Sarah Crespi to talk about a pair of studies that looked at how this happens in children’s immune systems.\n\nRead the related studies in Science and Science Immunology.\n\nIn our second segment this week, Sarah talks with Todd Thompson, of Ohio State University in Columbus, about his effort to find a small black hole in a binary pair with a red giant star. Usually black holes are detected because they are accruing matter and as the matter interacts with the black hole, x-rays are released. Without this flashy signal, black hole detection gets much harder. Astronomers must look for the gravitational influence of the black holes on nearby stars—which is easier to spot when the black hole is massive. Thompson talks with Sarah about a new approach to finding small, noninteracting black holes.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this week’s show: Bayer\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2bb14acfe163ad99e3c7a9a4b24b0e34","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/ef22be4f-6cba-466d-851f-aaf7013e9b5c/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: The impact of legal pot on opioid abuse, and a very early look at a fetus’s genome","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/7ca56786-89c2-4058-8bc1-aaea017907a8/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week, news writer Greg Miller chats with us about how the legalization of marijuana in certain U.S. states is having an impact on the nation’s opioid problem.

Gregr brings a unique cost-benefit perspective to his analysis, and finds many trade-offs with economic implications for fisheries For example, sea otters eat shellfish like urchins and crabs, depressing the shellfishing industry; but their diet encourages the growth of kelp forests, which in turn provide a habitat for economically important finfish, like salmon and rockfish.

ANITA has yet to detect those particles, but it has twice seen oddball radio signals that could be evidence of something even weirder: some heavier particle unknown to physicists’ standard model, burrowing up through Earth. Science writer Adrian Cho joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss the possibility that this reading could lead to a big change in physics.\n\nNext, host Meagan Cantwell asks researcher Ben Dalziel what makes a bad—or good—flu year. Traditionally, research has focused on two factors: climate, which impacts how long the virus stays active after a sneeze or cough, and changes in the virus itself, which can influence its infectiousness. But these factors don’t explain every pattern. Dalziel, a population biologist in the Departments of Integrative Biology and Mathematics at Oregon State University in Corvallis, explains how humidity and community size shape the way influenza spreads.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Stuart Rankin/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 19:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"740b7485d23c2502283e444faff7a523","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/c443cbd8-60c1-45b8-9bee-aaea017791fa/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"<i>Science</i> and <i>Nature</i> get their social science studies replicated—or not, the mechanisms behind human-induced earthquakes, and the taboo of claiming causality in science","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/b0592ea4-f38d-4f18-9aa3-aaea017798b8/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"A new project out of the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia, found that of all the experimental social science papers published in Science and Nature from 2010–15, 62% successfully replicated, even when larger sample sizes were used. What does this say about peer review? Host Sarah Crespi talks with Staff Writer Kelly Servick about how this project stacks up against similar replication efforts, and whether we can achieve similar results by merely asking people to guess whether a study can be replicated.\n\nPodcast producer Meagan Cantwell interviews Emily Brodsky of the University of California, Santa Cruz, about her research report examining why earthquakes occur as far as 10 kilometers from wastewater injection and fracking sites. Emily discusses why the well-established mechanism for human-induced earthquakes doesn’t explain this distance, and how these findings may influence where we place injection wells in the future.\n\nIn this month’s book podcast, Jen Golbeck interviews Judea Pearl and Dana McKenzie, authors of The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect. They propose that researchers have for too long shied away from claiming causality and provide a road map for bringing cause and effect back into science.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Jens Lambert, Shutterstock; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 18:30:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"02113fc5d0c8a85623da4fcf1dcf5c24","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/b0592ea4-f38d-4f18-9aa3-aaea017798b8/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: A farewell to <i>Science</i>’s editor-in-chief, how mosquito spit makes us sick, and bears that use human shields","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/a53de427-e6a3-466b-9bc5-aaea01791e8f/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Listen to how mosquito spit helps make us sick, mother bears protect their young with human shields, and blind cave fish could teach us a thing or two about psychiatric disease, with Online News Editor Catherine Matacic.

As the emergency phase of work winds down, scientists are also starting to use the lull in tourist activity to investigate the mysteries of the cathedral’s construction.\n\nAlso this week, Felipe Quiroz, an assistant professor in the biomedical engineering department at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, talks with Sarah about his paper on the cellular mechanism of liquid-liquid phase separation in the formation of the tough outer layer of the skin. Liquid-liquid phase separation is when two liquids “demix,” or separate, like oil and water. In cells, this process created membraneless organelles that are just now starting to be understood. In this work, Quiroz and colleagues create a sensor for phase separation in the cell that works in living tissue, and show how phase separation is tied to the formation of the outer layers of skin in mice.

Plagued with high attrition rates and fewer returning students every year, MOOCs have pivoted to a new revenue model—offering accredited master’s degrees for professionals. Host Meagan Cantwell speaks with Justin Reich, an assistant professor in the Comparative Media Studies Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, about the evolution of MOOCs and how these MOOC professional programs may be reaching a different audience than traditional online education.\n\nArchaeologists were flummoxed when they found a brilliant blue mineral in the dental plaque of a medieval-era woman from Germany. It turned out to be lapis lazuli—an expensive pigment that would have had to travel thousands of kilometers from the mines of Afghanistan to a monastery in Germany. Host Sarah Crespi talks to Christina Warinner, a professor of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, about how the discovery of this pigment shed light on the impressive life of the medieval woman, an artist who likely played a role in manuscript production.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image:Oberlin.edu/Wikimedia Commons; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 19:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a6a6e985532ba87c38cdd732aea48254","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/1a6ad5a9-197f-4882-a65a-aaea01778093/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105897},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Friction at the atomic level, the acoustics of historical speeches, and a news roundup","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/e70c2a02-6528-4f18-8b14-aaea017a935f/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Alexei Bylinskii discusses friction at the atomic level and Braxton Boren talks about the acoustics of historical spaces, and David Grimm discusses daily news stories with Sarah Crespi.

Piller joins Host Sarah Crespi to talk about the steps he took to uncover this double dipping and why ethicists say this a conflict of interest.  \n\nSarah also talks with Nate Lindsey, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, about turning a 50-kilometer undersea fiber optic cable designed to move data into a sensor for activity in the ocean and the land underneath. During a 4-day test in Monterey Bay, California, the cable detected earthquakes, faults, waves, and even ocean-going storms.\n\nFor this month’s books segment, Kiki Sandford talks with Dan Hooper about his book At the Edge of Time: Exploring the Mysteries of Our Universe’s First Seconds.  \n\nYou can find more books segments on the Books et al. blog.  \n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.  \n\nAds on this week’s show: McDonalds; Salk’s Where Cures Begin podcast  \n\nDownload the transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.  \n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"bc0e2445201216d05409db81c061a26f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/c5fce76a-5ab7-4c6f-b652-ab130151e1cb/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea0177555","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Effective Ebola vaccines and a daily news roundup","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/a212a492-c7d9-4496-a525-aaea017a82d1/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Andrea Marzi discusses a vaccine that is effective against Ebola in monkeys and David Grimm talks about weigh-loss surgery, carbon suckers, and sexist HVAC.

The ultimate goal is to coax the foreign cells into forming an organ for transplantation. But questions abound: Can evolutionarily distant animals, like pigs and humans, be mixed together to produce such organs? Or could species closely related to us, like chimps and macaques, stand in for tests with human cells? Staff Writer Kelly Servick joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss the research, the regulations, and the growing ethical debate.\n\nAlso this week, Sarah talks with Yossi Yovel of the School of Zoology and the Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University in Israel about his work on sensory integration in bats. Writing in Science Advances, he and his colleagues show through several clever experiments when bats switch between echolocation and vision. Yossi and Sarah discuss how these trade-offs in bats can inform larger questions about our own perception.\n\nFor our monthly books segment, Science books editor Valerie Thompson talks with Lucy Jones of the Seismological Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena about a song she created, based on 130 years of temperature data, for an instrument called the “viola de gamba.” Read more on the Books et al. blog.\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF)\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on the show: MagellanTV; KiwiCo\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: The Legend Kay/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 18:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"fcec5ec2cafbc1b5deb513a7ba352374","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/f16ac868-bb60-453b-97df-aaea017762cb/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Neandertals that made art, live news from the AAAS Annual Meeting, and the emotional experience of being a scientist","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/6fe572a9-2072-4fe8-9eb3-aaea0177bff5/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"We talk about the techniques of painting sleuths, how to combat alternative facts or “fake news,” and using audio signposts to keep birds from flying into buildings.

Her group used data from transcontinental racers—who ran 957 kilometers over the course of 20 weeks—and found that after about 100 days, their metabolism settled in at about 2.5 times the baseline rate, suggesting a hard limit on human endurance at long timescales. Earlier studies based on the 23-day Tour de France found much higher levels of energy expenditure, in the four- to five-times-baseline range.\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF)\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on the show: KiwiCo.com\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: N.

On 16 January 378 C.E., the Maya city lost its leader and the replacement may have been a stranger. We know from writings that the new leader wore the garb of another culture—the Teotihuacan—who lived in a giant city 1000 kilometers away. But was this new ruler of a Maya city really from a separate culture? New techniques being used at the Tikal and Teotihuacan sites have revealed conflicting evidence as to whether Teotihuacan really held sway over a much larger region than previously estimated.\n\nSarah also talks with Rashid Sumaila, professor and Canada research chair in interdisciplinary ocean and fisheries economics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver’s Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries. You may have heard of illegal fishing being bad for the environment or bad for maintaining fisheries—but as Sumaila and colleagues report this week in Science Advances, the illegal fishing trade is also incredibly costly—with gross revenues of between $8.9 billion and $17.2 billion each year.\n\nIn the books segment this month, Kiki Sanford interviews Gaia Vince about her new book Transcendence How Humans Evolved through Fire, Language, Beauty, and Time.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF).\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ef5550fde45059819f159f3c59711ecd","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/9d62662a-83f9-4aca-9c37-ab6e00eb9a4a/audio.mp3","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105895},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"How future elites view self-interest and equality and a news roundup","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/889c9aff-f322-402e-a392-aaea017a7e07/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Daniel Markovits discusses the preferences for fairness and equiality among potential future US leaders and David Grimm talks about finding fluorine's origins, persistant lone wolves, and the domestiction of the chicken.

It can take more than 15 years to breed a new kind of potato that farmers can grow, and genetic engineering just won’t work for tackling complex traits such as increased yield or heat resistance. Host Sarah Crespi talks with Staff Writer Erik Stokstad about how researchers are trying to simplify the potato genome to make it easier to manipulate through breeding.\n\nResearchers and companies are racing to perfect an injector pill—a pill that you swallow, which then uses a tiny needle to shoot medicine into the body. Such an approach could help improve compliance for injected medications like insulin. Host Meagan Cantwell and Staff Writer Robert F.

But despite their prevalence and importance to ecosystems around the world, there hasn’t been a comprehensive survey of earthworm diversity or population size. This week in Science, Helen Philips, a postdoctoral fellow at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research and the Institute of Biology at Leipzig University, and colleagues published the results of their worldwide earthworm study, composed of data sets from many worm researchers around the globe. Host Sarah Crespi gets the lowdown from Philips on earthworm myths, collaborating with worm researchers, and links between worm populations and climate. Read a related commentary here. \n\nSarah also talks with Ziad Obermeyer, a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, about dissecting out bias in an algorithm used by health care systems in the United States to recommend patients for additional health services. With unusual access to a proprietary algorithm, inputs, and outputs, Obermeyer and his colleagues found that the low amount of health care dollars spent on black patients in the past caused the algorithm to underestimate their risk for poor health in the future.

To break chains of transmission and community spread, the new strategy would replace highly accurate but slow polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests with cheaper, faster tests that are less accurate but can be administered frequently. Such tests cost between $1 and $3 compared with more than $100 for diagnostic PCR tests and give results in less than 30 minutes instead of days.\n\nRead all of our coronavirus coverage here.\n\nAlso this week, Salma Mousa, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, joins Sarah to talk about an experiment that added Muslim players to teams in a Christian soccer league in northern Iraq.

Now, because of their low cost and ease of launching, governments and private companies are looking to expand the range of these “sate-lites” deeper into space. Host Sarah Crespi talks with Deputy News Editor Eric Hand about the mods and missions in store for so-called CubeSats.\n\nAnd our newest podcast producer Meagan Cantwell interviews Quentin Grafton of Australian National University in Canberra and Brad Udall of Colorado State University in Fort Collins about something called the “irrigation efficiency paradox.” As freshwater supplies dry up around the world, policymakers and farmers have been quick to try to make up the difference by improving irrigation, a notorious water waster. It turns out that both human behavior and the difficulty of water measurement are plaguing water conservation efforts in agriculture. For example, when farms find they are using less water, they tend to plant ever-more-water-intensive crops.

And we don’t know whether animals have it, or whether we can detect it in patients in comas. Do neuroscientists even know where to look? A new competition aims to narrow down the bewildering number of theories of consciousness and get closer to finding its biological signs by pitting different theories against each other in experimental settings. Freelance journalist Sara Reardon talks with host Sarah Crespi about how the competition will work.\n\nIn our second segment, we talk about how we think about children. For thousands of years, adults have complained about their lack of respect, intelligence, and tendency to distraction, compared with previous generations. A new study out this week in Science Advances suggests our own biased childhood memories might be at fault. Sarah Crespi talks with John Protzko of the University of California, Santa Barbara, about how terrible people thought kids were in 3800 B.C.E. and whether understanding those biases might change how people view Generation Z today.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this week’s show: The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life by David Quanmen; Bayer; KiwiCo\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Andrea Kirkby/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 18:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"de0551905011e90fcbb7c60fd2ac4bca","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/652afc75-4de1-4134-8487-aaea01775a3a/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: Where dog breeds come from, bots that build buildings, and gathering ancient human DNA from cave sediments","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/37339261-0b93-4b33-b908-aaea0178e8a8/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week, a new family tree of dog breeds, advances in artificial wombs, and an autonomous robot that can print a building with Online News Editor David Grimm.  \n\nViviane Slon joins Sarah Crespi to discuss a new way to seek out ancient humans—without finding fossils or bones—by screening sediments for ancient DNA.  \n\nJen Golbeck interviews Andrew Shtulman, author of Scienceblind: Why Our Intuitive Theories About the World Are So Often Wrong for this month’s book segment.   \n\nListen to previous podcasts.  \n\nSee more book segments.    \n\nDownload the show transcript.\n\nTranscripts courtesy of Scribie.com.\n\n[Image: nimis69/iStockphoto; Music: Jeffrey Cook]  \n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d3a06d2f815eceb7a33896c123a03dae","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/37339261-0b93-4b33-b908-aaea0178e8a8/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105902},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"How the measles virus disables immunity to other diseases and a news roundup","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/20e456fb-2c55-4950-939b-aaea017a9899/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Michael Mina discusses how measles destroys immunity to other infectious diseases and why the measles vaccine has led to disproportionate reductions in childhood mortality since its introduction 50 years ago, and David Grimm discusses daily news stories.

Staff Writer Jennifer Couzin-Frankel talks with host Sarah Crespi about researchers that are turning back the pages on epilepsy, trying to get to the beginning of the story where new treatments might work.\n\nAnd Sarah also talks with Torsten Neurbert at the Technical University of Denmark’s National Space Institute in Kongens Lyngby about capturing high-altitude “transient luminous events” from the International Space Station (ISS). These lightning-induced bursts of light, color, and occasionally gamma rays were first reported in the 1990s but had only been recorded from the ground or aircraft.

This detailed map will help fine-tune climate models.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this show: Science Sessions Podcast; Kroger\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF) \n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Chris Couderc/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"96844dea7a018f4c0899ccdbff4e704b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/c04ade91-71ee-492d-b191-aaea01775a09/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Science Podcast - Life under funding change and a news roundup (4 April 2014) ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d591fc7f-1de5-47fc-abf8-aaea017ad6b3/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Money battles; roundup of daily news with David Grimm.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Apr 2014 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b6b8ff4face8e07c7a50e39e381b044c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d591fc7f-1de5-47fc-abf8-aaea017ad6b3/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105905},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Monitoring 600 years of upwelling off the California coast (19 September 2014) ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/10d657c3-be27-4398-9a50-aaea017abea3/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Hindcasting weather over the ocean near the California coast for 600 years.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7c9d92feb929c1e9afe032b8919fe5c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/10d657c3-be27-4398-9a50-aaea017abea3/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105905},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Science Podcast - Noisy gene expression, the Tohoku-oki fault, and snake venom as a healer (6 Dec 2013) ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/9ad5e53d-17af-4ff3-a395-aaea017ae9c2/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Discussing the origin of transcriptional noise with Alvaro Sanchez; examining results from a drilling expedition at the Tohoku-oki fault; and looking at the potential benefits of snake venom with Kai Kupferschmidt.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Dec 2013 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"53b45a05e85882715f800032b3e39a88","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/9ad5e53d-17af-4ff3-a395-aaea017ae9c2/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105906},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: A close look at a giant moon crater, the long tradition of eating rodents, and building evidence for Planet Nine","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/7077da3a-5075-45de-a8d1-aaea01790929/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week, we chat about some of our favorite stories—eating rats in the Neolithic, growing  evidence for a gargantuan 9th planet in our solar system, and how to keep  just the good parts of a hookworm infection—with Science’s Online News Editor David Grimm.

New research suggests our linguistic prowess might arise from the same process that brought domesticated dogs big eyes and bonobos the power to read others’ intent. Online News Editor Catherine Matacic joins host Sarah Crespi to talk about how humans might have self-domesticated themselves, leading to physical and behavioral changes that gave us a “language-ready” brain.\n\nSarah also talks with Micah Edelson of the University of Zurich in Switzerland about his group’s research into the role that “responsibility aversion”—the reluctance to make decisions for a group—might play when people decide to lead or defer in a group setting. In their experiments, the team found that some people adjusted how much risk they would take on, depending on whether they were deciding for themselves alone or for the entire group. The ones who didn’t—those who stuck to the same plan whether others were involved or not—tended to score higher on standardized tests of leadership and have held higher military rank.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\n[Image: Scaly breasted munia/Ravi Vaidyanathan; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"43b30b48ec706ae31a832502347d03a7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d42b53ef-f7a0-48b3-aa79-aaea01779b07/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Fighting cancer with CRISPR, and dating ancient rock art with wasp nests","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/02656791-9de3-4354-99b3-ab5900e8409a/audio.mp3","description":"On this week’s show, Staff Writer Jennifer Couzin-Frankel joins host Sarah Crespi to talk about a Science paper that combines two hot areas of research—CRISPR gene editing and immunotherapy for cancer—and tests it in patients.\n\nSarah also talks with Damien Finch, a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne, about the Kimberly region of Australia and dating its ice age cave paintings using charcoal from nearby wasp nests.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF).\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Feb 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8d9b98b9acf6f3cb411484988bfa2104","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/02656791-9de3-4354-99b3-ab5900e8409a/audio.mp3","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105895},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Next-generation cellphone signals could interfere with weather forecasts, and monitoring smoke from wildfires to model nuclear winter","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/3dc590e6-03c6-42a2-b12f-aaea01775d20/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"In recent months, telecommunications companies in the United States have purchased a new part of the spectrum for use in 5G cellphone networks.

Nicole Culbert and colleges write this week in Science Robotics about a new way to deal with deadly mosquitoes—using drones. The drones are designed to drop hundreds of thousands of sterile male mosquitoes in areas with high risk of mosquito-borne illness. The idea is that sterile male mosquitoes will mate with females and the females then lay infertile eggs, which causes the population to decline. They found this drone-based approach is cheaper and more efficient than other methods of releasing sterile mosquitoes and does not have the problems associated with pesticide-based eradication efforts such as resistance and off-target effects.\n\nThis week’s episode was produced with help from Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF).\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b481bfc3b773d8802304614ca0943070","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/44378d16-ec53-413b-aea5-abdd012fb590/audio.mp3","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105895},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Should we prioritize which endangered species to save, and why were chemists baffled by soot for so long?","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/98d324a2-7000-47e2-9cfd-aaea0177971e/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"We are in the middle of what some scientists are calling the sixth mass extinction and not all at-risk species can be saved.

Unfortunately, few systematic studies have been done, but observations of outbreaks in schools in places such as France or Israel do offer a few lessons for countries looking to send children back to school soon. The United Kingdom and Germany have started studies of how the virus spreads in children and at school, but results are months away. In the meantime, Gretchen’s reporting suggests small class sizes, masks, and social distancing among adults at schools are particularly important measures.\n\nRead all our coronavirus news coverage.\n\nAlso this week, Sarah talks with Kirstie Thompson, a Ph.D. student in the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, about increasing the efficiency of petroleum processing. If all—or even some—petroleum processing goes heat free, it would mean big energy savings. Around the world, about 1% of all energy use goes to heating up petroleum in order to get useful things such as gas for cars or polymers for plastics. These days, this separation is done through distillation, heating, and separating by boiling point. Kirstie describes a heat-free way of getting this separation—by using a special membrane instead.\n\nRead a related Insight.\n\nThis week’s episode was produced with help from Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF).\n\n[Image: Kurt Bauschardt/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3940891b6a24c08e92127c3bab2d41b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/8a34bdcc-1bdb-428f-a535-abfa00fbac6c/audio.mp3","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105895},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"From nose to toes—how coronavirus affects the body, and a quantum microscope that unlocks the magnetic secrets of very old rocks","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/aaa18a8c-073d-416a-8f9b-aba601061f1f/audio.mp3","description":"Coronavirus affects far more than just the lungs, and doctors and researchers in the midst of the pandemic are trying to catalog—and understand—the virus’ impact on our bodies.

But until now, the speed and totality of these murders were poorly understood. It turns out that about one-quarter of all Jews killed during the Holocaust were murdered in the autumn of 1942, during this operation. Meagan talks with Lewi Stone, a professor of biomathematics at Tel Aviv University in Israel and mathematical science at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, about this shocking kill rate, and why researchers are taking a quantitative approach to characterizing genocides.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Michael Beckwith; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Jan 2019 19:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"213151ae5ac95b195e8b2d593da3a0e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/7c5db7c5-670e-4756-af36-aaea01778142/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105897},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Privacy concerns slow Facebook studies, and how human fertility depends on chromosome counts","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/0ef3632b-1d8c-4e4c-96e8-aaea01775aab/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"On this week’s show, Senior News Correspondent Jeffrey Mervis talks with host Sarah Crespi about a stalled Facebook plan to release user data to social scientists who want to study the site’s role in elections.\n\nSarah also talks with Jennifer Gruhn, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Copenhagen Center for Chromosome Stability, about counting chromosomes in human egg cells.

Though the chance to resume research may instill a sense of hope, new policies around physical distancing and access to facilities threaten to derail studies—and even careers. Despite all the uncertainty, the crisis could result in new approaches that ultimately benefit the scientific community and the world.\n\nAlso this week, Joel Podgorski, a senior scientist in the Water Resources and Drinking Water Department at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss the global threat of arsenic in drinking water. Arsenic is basically present in all rocks in minute amounts. Under the right conditions it can leach into groundwater and poison drinking water. Without a noticeable taste or smell, arsenic contamination can go undetected for years. The paper, published in Science, estimates that more than 100 million people are at risk of drinking arsenic-contaminated water and provides a guide for the most important places to test.\n\nThis week’s episode was produced with help from Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF).\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"309163e5c51b767d2dac2169ca6faa51","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/1da9e03d-6b3f-4fde-bf1d-abc101525b16/audio.mp3","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105895},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"A big increase in monkey research and an overhaul for the metric system","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/efe17b53-b88e-4e2a-bfd6-aaea01778816/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"A new report suggests a big increase in the use of monkeys in laboratory experiments in the United States in 2017.

Annika talks with Sarah about why studying play behavior in animals is important for understanding the connections between play and learning in both rats and humans.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this week’s show: MOVA Globes; Kroger’s Zero Hunger, Zero Waste campaign\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF) \n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Tambako The Jaguar/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:15:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f8ee569613191ea4150bc09bb73f3544","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/2217da4f-b9cf-4f7e-ac5e-aaea017759ed/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: An ethics conundrum from the Nazi era, baby dinosaur development, and a new test for mad cow disease ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/73f73e3b-f6a5-473a-8210-aaea0178f9ad/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week, we chat about  how long dinosaur eggs take—or took—to hatch, a new survey that confirms the world’s  hot spots for lightning, and  replenishing endangered species with feral pets with Online News Editor Catherine Matacic.

In it, Hardin questioned society’s ability to manage shared resources, concluding that individuals will act in their self-interest and ultimately spoil the resource. Host Meagan Cantwell revisits this classic paper with two experts: Tine De Moor, professor of economics and social history at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, and Brett Frischmann, a professor of law, business, and economics at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. They discuss how premodern societies dealt with common resources and how our current society might apply the concept to a more abstract resource—knowledge.\n\nNot all human skulls are the same shape—and if yours is a little less round, you may have your extinct cousins, the Neanderthals, to thank. Meagan speaks with Simon Fisher, neurogeneticist and director of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, about why living humans with two Neanderthal gene variants have slightly less round heads—and how studying Neanderthal DNA can help us better understand our own biology.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Phillip Gunz; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 19:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"991c0b505a80aef8a41a0d6f4eb329c2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/6a3bf8bd-dadf-4cb8-a9ef-aaea017785c2/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105897},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Moralizing gods, scientific reproducibility, and a daily news roundup","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/d5cbdb4c-e052-40b6-94cf-aaea017a88b4/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Brian Nosek discusses the reproducibility of science, Lizzie Wade delves into the origin of religions with moralizing gods.

Now, investigators are using other parts of the genome—such as markers for hair and eye color—to help rule people in and out as suspects. Staff Writer Gretchen Vogel talks with Sarah Crespi about whether science supports this approach and how different countries are dealing with this new type of evidence.\n\nSarah also talks with Jill Fernandes of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, about her Science Advances paper on a light-based technique for detecting Zika in mosquitoes. Instead of grinding up the bug and extracting Zika DNA, her group shines near-infrared light through the body. Mosquitoes carrying Zika transmit this light differently from uninfected ones. If it’s successful in larger trials, this technique could make large-scale surveillance of infected mosquitoes quicker and less expensive.\n\nIn our monthly books segment, Jen Golbeck talks with author Sarah-Jayne Blakemore about her new work: Inventing Ourselves: The Secret Life of the Teenage Brain.

When did people first start to milk animals and where? It turns out, the spread of human genetic adaptations for drinking milk do not closely correspond to the history of consuming milk from animals. Instead, evidence from ancient dental plaque suggests people from all over the world developed different ways of chugging milk—not all of them genetic.\n\nNext, Host Meagan Cantwell speaks with Sheril Kirshenbaum, co-director of the Michigan State University Food Literacy and Engagement Poll, about the public’s perception of food waste. Do most people try to conserve food and produce less waste? Better insight into the point of view of consumers may help keep billions of kilograms of food from being discarded every year in the United States.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF)\n\nAds on the show: Columbia University and Magellan TV\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image:  Carefull in Wyoming/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"536c37cc719650c23a0a64901523a0c3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/e34142fb-edfc-4dc5-b527-aaea01776f61/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105897},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: Scientists on the night shift, sucking up greenhouse gases with cement, and repetitive stress in tomb builders","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/a56f1403-73b3-4a88-b3ad-aaea0178fd5c/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":" This week, we chat about  cement’s shrinking carbon footprint,  commuting hazards for ancient Egyptian artisans, and a new bipartisan group  opposed to government-funded animal research in the United States with Online News Editor David Grimm.

That tough stuff is made up of polymers—basically just byproducts of cooking—and it is so persistent that researchers have found similar molecules that have survived hundreds of millions of years. And these aren’t from cook fires. They are actually the byproducts of death and fossilization. Host Sarah Crespi talks with Contributing Correspondent Gretchen Vogel about how these molecules can be found on the surface of certain fossils and used as fingerprints for the proteins that once dwelled in dinos.\n\nAnd Sarah talks with Zunfeng Liu, a professor at Nankai University in Tianjin, China, about a new cooling technology based on a 100-year-old observation that a stretched rubber band is warm and a relaxed one is cool. It’s going to be hard to beat the 60% efficiency of compression-based refrigerators and air conditioning units, but Zunfeng and colleagues aim to try, with twists and coils that can cool water by 7°C when relaxed.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this week’s show: The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life by David Quammen\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 19:15:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"631ee91535b046a4dd7547ed650ceb50","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/b9e48d57-c2e2-4bc8-8a98-aaea0177683d/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Doubts about the drought that kicked off our latest geological age, and a faceoff between stink bugs with samurai wasps","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/52a4e33a-b832-4fb9-9353-aaea01779afd/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"We now live in the Meghalayan age—the last age of the Holocene epoch. Did you get the memo? A July decision by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, which is responsible for naming geological time periods, divided the Holocene into three ages: the Greenlandian, the Northgrippian, and the Meghalayan. The one we live in—the Meghalayan age (pronounced “megalion”)—is pegged to a global drought thought to have happened some 4200 years ago. But many critics question the timing of this latest age and the global expanse of the drought. Staff writer Paul Voosen talks with host Sarah Crespi about the evidence for and against the global drought—and what it means if it’s wrong.\n\nSarah also talks to staff writer Kelly Servick about her feature story on what happens when biocontrol goes out of control. Here’s the setup: U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers wanted to know whether brown marmorated stink bugs that have invaded the United States could be controlled—aka killed—by importing their natural predators, samurai wasps, from Asia. But before they could find out, the wasps showed up anyway. Kelly discusses how using one species to combat another can go wrong—or right—and what happens when the situation outruns regulators.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\n[Image: Melissa McMasters/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook] \n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 18:15:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e87674038b043251ca5442b57077ee7e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/52a4e33a-b832-4fb9-9353-aaea01779afd/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"New targets for the world’s biggest atom smasher and wood designed to cool buildings","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/1244e08f-59e3-45fc-b7f4-aaea01776be7/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was built with one big goal in mind: to find the Higgs boson. It did just that in 2012. But the question on many physicists’ minds about the LHC is, “What have you done for me lately?” Host Sarah Crespi talks with Staff Writer Adrian Cho about proposals to look at the showers of particles created by its proton collisions in new ways—from changing which events are recorded, to changing how the data are analyzed, even building more detectors outside of the LHC proper—all in the hopes that strange, longer-lived particles are being generated but missed by the current set up.\n\nAlso this week, Sarah talks with Tian Li of the University of Maryland in College Park about a modified wood designed to passively cool buildings. Starting from its humble roots in the forest, the wood is given a makeover: First it is bleached white to eliminate pigments that absorb light. Next, it is hot pressed, which adds strength and durability. Most importantly, these processes allow the wood to emit in the middle-infrared range, so that when facing the sky, heat passes through the wood out to the giant heat sink of outer space.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 May 2019 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ae665760a201392d88dc46009f2175e0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/1244e08f-59e3-45fc-b7f4-aaea01776be7/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"The dangers of dismantling a geoengineered sun shield and the importance of genes we don’t inherit","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/c3c4c0a3-e54c-4e42-8ea7-aaea01781300/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Catherine Matacic—online news editor for Science—talks with Sarah Crespi about how geoengineering could reduce the harshest impacts of climate change, but make them even worse if it were ever turned off.\n\nSarah also interviews Augustine Kong of the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom about his Science paper on the role of noninherited “nurturing genes.” For example, educational attainment has a genetic component that may or may not be inherited. But having a parent with a predisposition for attainment still influences the child—even if those genes aren’t passed down.

Humans do it. Possums do it. But monotremes such as the platypus and echidna—although still mammals—gave up suckling long ago. Instead, they lap at milky patches on their mothers’ skin to get early sustenance. Science News Writer Gretchen Vogel talks with host Sarah Crespi about the newest suckling science—it turns out monotremes probably had suckling ancestors, but gave it up for the ability to grind up tasty, hard-shelled, river-dwelling creatures.\n\nSarah also talks with Sandra Yuter of North Carolina State University in Raleigh about her work on fast-clearing clouds off the southwest coast of Africa. These immense marine layers appear to be exiting the coastal regions under the influence of gravity waves (not to be confused with gravitational waves). This finding can help scientists better model cloud behavior, particularly with respect to their influence on global temperatures.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\n[Image: North Carolina State University]    \n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f966cc96e4e83d6d0706deaef9864d38","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/49652f0a-77f1-4e4a-95b4-aaea01779ccc/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105900},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Can math apps benefit kids?

It turns out the fidelity is quite high—you can still tell mice lineages apart by their gut microbes after 10 generations. And horizontally transmitted microbes, those that jump from one mouse line to another through exposure to common spaces or handlers, were more likely than inherited bacteria to be pathogenic and were often linked to illnesses in people.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Bob Dass/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook] \n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 18:30:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c4629d1a90b26b14a28d18ffcc2f9bec","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/10266c85-e257-46fc-a377-aaea01778a35/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105899},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Treating the microbiome, and a gene that induces sleep","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/10de7aad-9d4f-4e56-a7ee-aaea01777f84/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Orla Smith, editor of Science Translational Medicine joins host Sarah Crespi to talk about what has changed in the past 10 years of microbiome research, what’s getting close to being useful in treatment, and how strong, exactly, the research is behind those probiotic yogurts.\n\nWhen you’re sick, sleeping is restorative—it helps your body recover from nasty infections.

Host Sarah Crespi talks with contributing correspondent Kai Kupferschmidt about how scientists are looking to algae, bacteria, flowers—even minerals from deep under Earth’s crust—in the age-old quest for the rarest of pigments.\n\nAlso this week, host Meagan Cantwell speaks with Andrew Whitehead, associate professor in the department of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Davis, about how the Atlantic killifish rescued its cousin, the gulf killifish, from extreme pollution. Whitehead talks about how a gene exchange occurred between these species that normally live thousands of kilometers apart, and whether this research could inform future conservation efforts.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF)\n\nAds on this show: KiwiCo\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 May 2019 18:45:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"66f6e14070d090784856f45ec7e7d7b0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/7779f04a-a072-4f63-9c47-aaea01776cd9/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282105896},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:15:05","title":"Podcast: Why we murder, resurrecting extinct animals, and the latest on the three-parent baby","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/3108e30b-2e92-4092-891f-aaea0179088f/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"Daily news stories Should we bring  animals back from extinction,  three-parent baby announced, and the  roots of human violence, with David Grimm.   From the magazine Our networked world gives us an unprecedented ability to monitor and respond to global happenings.

Researchers are now using the tools of archaeology to learn more about the day-to-day lives of enslaved Africans—how they survived the conditions of slavery, how they participated in local economies, and how they maintained their own agency. Host Sarah Crespi talks with Contributing Correspondent Lizzie Wade about a Caribbean archaeology project based on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and launched by the founders of the Society for Black Archaeologists that aims to unearth these details. Watch a related video here.\n\nSarah also talks with Jonathan Schulz, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, about a role for the medieval Roman Catholic Church in so-called WEIRD psychology—western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic. The bulk of psychology experiments have used participants that could be described as WEIRD, and according to many psychological measures, WEIRD subjects tend to have some extreme traits, like a stronger tendency toward individuality and more friendliness with strangers. Schulz and colleagues used historical maps and measures of kinship structure to tie these traits to strict marriage rules enforced by the medieval Catholic Church in Western Europe.
