Now, a startup that built a whole business around loaning money to SMBs has been acquired by a giant in the world of credit as the fintech industry begins to size up what the &#8220;new normal&#8221; will look like when it comes to doing business with smaller businesses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://Kabbage.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kabbage</a>, which had built a platform that uses machine learning algorithms to assess and loan out money to small business owners, is getting gobbled up by American Express, the <a href=\"https://newsroom.kabbage.com/news/kabbage-to-join-american-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two</a> companies <a href=\"https://about.americanexpress.com/all-news/news-details/2020/American-Express-to-Acquire-Kabbage/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a> today. Amex says it has &#8220;millions&#8221; of small business customers and the addition of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/kabbage\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kabbage\">Kabbage&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> loan and other financial services tools signifies that it plans to double down on that sector with a much wider range of offerings.</p>\n<p>The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but reports earlier this month put the value of the acquisition at <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-10/amex-said-to-be-in-advanced-talks-to-buy-softbank-backed-kabbage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">up to $850 million</a>. For some context, Kabbage had raised nearly $990 billion in debt and equity (and at least $3.5 billion in securitizations), and was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/small-business-loan-platform-kabbage-nabs-250m-from-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">valued at over $1.2 billion</a> in its last equity round of $250 million, in 2017, led by SoftBank.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The acquisition comes at a tricky time not just for SMBs but also the fintech companies that serve them, and specifically for Kabbage itself, with all of them weathering the storms of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Amex&#8217;s acquisition, tellingly, will include employees, technology and financial data, but “Kabbage’s pre-existing loan portfolio is not included in the purchase agreement,&#8221; Amex noted in its press release.</p>\n<p>As for what happens with that loan portfolio, a spokesperson for Kabbage said there will be a separate entity that manages and services these loans at the time of close.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have a total amount of value for that loan book, but a spokesperson confirmed it includes not just loans that Kabbage had issued in its previous years of operation, but also loans made to SMBs in the U.S. under the Paycheck Protection Program. As of <a href=\"https://newsroom.kabbage.com/news/kabbage_ppp_results_report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">last week</a> the latter totaled $7 billion across nearly 300,000 loans; and in 2019 Kabbage told TechCrunch it was on pace to loan out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/kabbage-secures-200m-to-fuel-its-ai-based-loans-platform-for-small-businesses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">between $2.5 billion and $3 billion</a>, so the pre-existing loan portfolio is not insignificant, and in current economic times, possibly one that comes with a lot of risk.</p>\n<p>The news caps off an interesting run in the world of fintech that has seen Kabbage hit some significant ups and downs. The company attracted the attention of SoftBank and many other investors (and customers) on the back of a fast-growing business based around the idea of using artificial intelligence to speed up the process of small businesses applying for and subsequently getting loans.</p>\n<p>Disrupting traditional banks and their slow and often frustrating approach to evaluating loan applications, Kabbage taps a wide variety of sources, from traditional accounting statements through to social media signals, into its proprietary machine learning algorithms, in order to determine eligibility for issuing loans, and the terms under which a business would pay it back. It was successful enough that Kabbage was also offering its product as a white-label service to other loan providers (including the banks it was disrupting).</p>\n<p>But things have been tricky since February, with business dropping off a cliff after many SMBs were forced to shut their doors at the start of the pandemic &#8212; with too many of those closures becoming permanent. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/smb-loans-platform-kabbage-to-furlough-a-significant-number-of-staff-close-office-in-bangalore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">furloughed</a> a significant proportion of its staff at the end of March, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/softbank-backed-lender-cuts-off-businesses-as-cash-needs-mount\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">abruptly shut down its credit lines</a> for SMBs in April and then slowly brought things back online as one of the three biggest PPP lenders.</p>\n<p>But PPP is a short-term program, and so a deal between Kabbage and Amex underscores how the two will join forces to bring a different approach to providing financial services to SMBs for the longer term, specifically by consolidating what they do under one roof.</p>\n<p>“For several years, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/americanexpress\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"americanexpress\">American Express has <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> been expanding beyond our industry-leading commercial card products to offer our business customers a growing set of payment and working capital solutions,” said Anna Marrs, president of Global Commercial Services at American Express, in a statement. “This acquisition accelerates our plans to offer U.S. small businesses an easy and efficient way to manage their payments and cash flow digitally in one place, which is more critical than ever in today’s environment. By bringing together Kabbage’s innovative technology and talented team with our broad distribution capabilities and over 60 years of experience backing small businesses, we can better help our customers successfully emerge from this challenging period and beyond.”</p>\n<p>“At Kabbage, we have always made the success of America’s small businesses our primary objective,” said Kabbage CEO and co-founder, Rob Frohwein, in a statement. “We have built a technology and data platform that provides them with the kind of capabilities and insights often reserved for larger businesses. By joining American Express, we can help more small businesses succeed with a fully digital suite of financial products to help them run and grow their companies.”</p>\n<p>More to come.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AMTay0fMyPY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 19:22:35 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/5110067974_95095620fa_b.jpg?w=533","linkMd5":"54991c12756114ab367ad1c93ceba33e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-03-829_5e238f661d40f48a.webp","author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn2@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-02-49-063_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-190_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-284_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn94@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-246_f3a2584c6699a0f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AMTay0fMyPY:no6VuLh1aPA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn25@2020_1/2020/08/18/06-03-03-341_6c207bf44bc6aaa6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn2@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-04-334_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AMTay0fMyPY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn65@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-063_f43f8a7b0efef2d0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597730565545},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","title":"Learn how COVID-19 has disrupted the startup world","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2029998","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">What early-stage startup founder wouldn’t love to have a crystal ball?

Tesla, an automaker that delivered 367,500 vehicles in 2019 and is aiming to exceed the 500,000-mark in 2020, is worth more than the combined market valuations of America&#8217;s Big Three automakers: GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Strike that, Tesla is now worth more than those companies <em>combined</em> by a factor of three and a half.</p>\n<p>And while Tesla expects to deliver more than a half-million cars in 2020 &#8212; not a number to scoff at, mind, it&#8217;s material &#8212; Ford managed 2019 sales of 2.41 million in the U.S. alone. Fiat Chrysler sold 2.2 million cars in the U.S. during the same year, and GM managed 2.89 million. And Tesla is worth a multiple of their aggregate.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<h2>Why the gains?</h2>\n<p>There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any fundamental reason why Tesla&#8217;s shares rose more than 11.2% today to close at $1,835.64. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives apparently had a positive call today about Tesla, according <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-shoots-up-toward-another-record-after-wedbush-analyst-boosts-target-to-4th-highest-on-the-street-2020-08-17?mod=mw_quote_news\">to MarketWatch</a>, but that&#8217;s only worth so much. Surely not a few dozen billion dollars.</p>\n<p>The story here is valuation momentum at the well-known EV company that started this spring and has accelerated since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/tesla-announces-5-for-1-share-split-rallies-8/\">Tesla recently announced plans for a 5 for 1 stock split</a>.</p>\n<p>Like a tiny snowball that has turned into an avalanche, the change is proving stunning. Consider where Tesla was two years ago. CEO Elon Musk had just tweeted that he had “funding secured” and was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.</p>\n<p>Musk would later backtrack and Tesla would remain public. But the tweets and leaked emails that followed got the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which later accused Musk of securities fraud. The parties reached a settlement without admitting wrongdoing. Under the settlement, Tesla agreed to add two independent directors and Musk would step down as chairman for three years.</p>\n<p>The shares bopped along — spiking and then dropping, as volatile stocks are wont to do. Tesla shares reached a 52-week low of $211 in August 2019. The stock has risen around 770% since.</p>\n<h2>Valuing Tesla</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a running finance joke that whenever a company&#8217;s share price does something odd and inexplicable that the move was <em>certainly</em> based on the changing present value of its future cash flows. Such is the case today, when Tesla shares jumped sharply sans material news.</p>\n<p>Surely the move was based on the changing present value of its future cash flows.</p>\n<p>Jokes aside, Tesla shares are not comically overbought, measured using any normal financial metric you prefer. On a price/sales basis, for example, Tesla is trading at a multiple of around 13.7x its revenue, according to <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/\">YCharts data</a>. GM? A 0.38x revenue multiple. Toyota is worth much more than GM in price/sales terms, managing a 0.77x multiple, or about double.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s a single-digit <em>percentage</em> of the revenue multiple that Tesla commands. Toyota&#8217;s price/book ratio of 0.98x. Tesla&#8217;s is 34.6x, again leaning on YCharts data.</p>\n<p>It may be the case that Tesla is set to race past its rivals, secure the top position in the electric car market, run the EV show for a decade and shower its shareholders in dividends and buybacks. That&#8217;s how its stock priced today, at least. If it falls short of that investor expectation, expect some pullback at some point. And perhaps some more days when it just adds 10% for no reason.</p>\n<p>You know, when the present value of its future cash flows appreciate by a tenth, sans news.</p>\n<p><em>For fun, this is what

class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-financial\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lightspeed-financial\">Lightspeed <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> India Partners on Tuesday announced it has closed $275 million from LPs for its third fund as the top American venture firm looks to ramp up its investments in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>\n<p>The new fund, its biggest for India, will enable Lightspeed India Partners to make early stage bets on more than two dozen startups in the region, said Hemant Mohapatra, a partner at the firm, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The announcement comes as the firm, which began investing in India in 2007, has made <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/india-oyo-ritesh-agarwal-investment/\">two high-profile partial exits in the past year</a> from budget-lodging startup Oyo and edtech giant Byju’s that together delivered cash returns of more than $900 million.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Some of its other major bets including backing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/udaan-series-d/\">business-to-business marketplace Udaan</a>, which was valued at more than $2.75 billion last year, local <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/sharechat-twitter-seriesd/\">social media platform ShareChat</a>, which is in advanced stages of discussions to raise capital at more than $1 billion valuation, and SaaS startups <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/india-darwinbox-raises-15m-to-bring-hr-tech-platform-to-more-asian-markets/\">DarwinBox</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/conversational-ai-startup-yellow-messenger-raises-20m-series-b-from-lightspeed/\">Yellow Messenger</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/okcredit-series-b/\">OkCredit</a>.</p>\n<p>The firm, which has six partners in the region, closed its first dedicated fund for India, of $135 million, in 2015. In 2018, it closed its second fund for the region, which was $175 million in size. But the venture firm has invested more than $750 million to date.</p>\n<p>The Indian arm, which typically invests at early stages of a startup, continues to work with its global mothership for writing bigger checks to support some portfolio startups at later phases. (More than 80% of its investments have been committed to firms at Seed or Series A stages in India.)</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the strongest points of differentiation we have. There are not many venture firms that have such a global presence. Our synergy with the global fund will continue,” said Mohapatra. (Lightspeed also has a big presence in China. Last year, its China arm <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/02/lightspeed-china-560-million/\">announced a $560 million fund</a>.)</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2032759\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2032759\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2032759 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"908\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg?resize=768,349 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg?resize=1536,697 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2032759\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lightspeed partners in India.

Sequoia, its global peer, announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/sequoia-announces-1-35-billion-venture-and-growth-funds-for-india-and-southeast-asia/\">two venture funds</a>, of $1.35 billion in size, last month for India and Southeast Asia. 11 of its early-stage bets have grown to become unicorns in the last 14 years in this region.</p>\n<p>Mohapatra said the Indian startup ecosystem has matured in recent years, demonstrating high-scale growth and delivering big outcomes. It&#8217;s also seeing more exits than ever before. Earlier this month, Byju&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/\">acquired WhiteHat Jr.</a>, an 18-month-old startup that teaches coding to children, for $300 million in an all-cash deal.</p>\n<p>Indian startups <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/29/indian-tech-startups-funding-amount-2019/\">raised more than $14.5 billion last year</a> &#8212; a record for the local community. The coronavirus has decelerated the funding spree in India, like in any other market.</p>\n<p>Mohapatra said a fraction of the firm&#8217;s portfolio startups has been disrupted by the virus, but noted that most startups are marching ahead unfazed and some have accelerated in recent months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lightspeed believes this is when the best entrepreneurs and companies of the future will emerge. Strong founders are utilizing the tailwinds of India&#8217;s digital ecosystem growth to build out a new future and Lightspeed is strongly committed to backing these founders,&#8221; the firm said in a statement.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Xq-aERl3dWI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 02:22:31 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg","linkMd5":"1d782f79587f972582ff6a24824702bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn85@2020_1/2020/08/18/06-02-49-129_0d06d36a7237d2ff.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":908,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lightspeed-india.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn85@2020_1/2020/08/18/06-02-49-129_0d06d36a7237d2ff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn2@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-02-49-063_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-190_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-284_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn30@2020_2/2020/08/18/06-03-03-227_614d477a27853d1c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Xq-aERl3dWI:-rzMR6aTgy0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/18/06-03-03-372_2554473aaae52518.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn2@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-04-334_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Xq-aERl3dWI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn58@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-03-271_2747d37762acb1dc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597730565541},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","title":"Datasembly’s real time pricing tool for consumer goods raises $10.3 million","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2032652","description":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Washington-based <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.datasembly.com/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!Rd4XVKQU1Rr1cc7JyVA2gquIk4InKuv6QbI-R-C_D8rkTVyGhxjQ-O5CGxUL_cD6wllGIQ9A$\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.datasembly.com/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!Rd4XVKQU1Rr1cc7JyVA2gquIk4InKuv6QbI-R-C_D8rkTVyGhxjQ-O5CGxUL_cD6wllGIQ9A$&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1597773190297000&#38;usg=AFQjCNFZWaFuER7CTtt1ynsRtMli89pe4A\">Datasembly</a> aims to take the guesswork out of the pricing for consumer goods.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company founded by Ben Reich and Dan Gallagher initially started as a project the two men developed after working at a retail analytics firm in the DC area.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What they observed while trying to collect information on pricing for goods and services for large consumer brands and national retailers was that there were so many things in the data collection that were flat out wrong, according to Reich.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Companies are making multi-million dollar decisions on data that is incomplete&#8230; They&#8217;re trying to track the competition and understand their own place in the market,&#8221; said Reich. But without the proper tools, they just can&#8217;t, he said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The problem becomes even more acute as retailers move to address consumers&#8217; shifting tastes with regional, local, and hyperlocal specificity, Reich said. Datasembly boasts that its software can provide real-time data on availability and pricing to its customers anywhere in the country.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Datasembly solves the problem by scraping data on a massive scale, Reich said. The company, which went through the 500 Startups accelerator and had previously raised a small seed round had just closed on a $10.3 million series A round led by Craft Ventures with participation from Valor Siren Ventures.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company counts three of the nation&#8217;s largest consumer packaged goods brands and two of the top five regional and national retailers among its customers already, according to a statement.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the new money, Datasembly plans to expand its sales and marketing and product development efforts. As a result of the round, David Sacks, the founding COO of PayPal, founder of the messaging service Yammer, and co-founder fo Craft Ventures, will take a seat on the Datasembly board.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“For the last 20 years, retail industry data sets have remained largely unchanged. Now, Datasembly is leveraging technology to transform what companies can see, share, and do in a way that wasn’t practical or even possible before,” said Sacks, co-founder and general partner of Craft Ventures, in a statement. “Ben and the Datasembly team are changing the industry’s expectations of what’s possible when it comes to competitive pricing information. I can’t imagine a retail or CPG brand that wouldn’t want to take advantage of this data.”</p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/dx49gP4_w04\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 20:07:23 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-photo-3962285.jpeg?w=600","linkMd5":"aea71c4db3e8b799da4bee60d6879244","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-03-354_3f0ad5daf5d1c5f7.webp","author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn2@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-02-49-063_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-190_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-284_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_2/2020/08/18/06-03-04-163_28f148045324fc9a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dx49gP4_w04:fPgkIK-BvdU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn93@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-273_bab5b5ce90085ae8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn2@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-04-334_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/dx49gP4_w04":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-03-170_b32a6268ecc517ac.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597730565543},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","title":"Epic files motion for injunction against Apple over threat to revoke all developer access","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2032597","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">After <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/fortnite-app-store-removed-apple/\">taking a stand</a> against Apple&#8217;s hefty cut of the money developers make through the App Store, Fortnite maker Epic Games shows no signs of backing down.

The company cites concerns that Apple&#8217;s actions against its developer access will damage its business beyond Fortnite, particularly its work on Unreal Engine, the prominent game engine it licenses to third party software makers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[Apple] told Epic that by August 28, Apple will cut off Epic’s access to all development tools necessary to create software for Apple’s platforms—including for the Unreal Engine Epic offers to third-party developers, which Apple has never claimed violated any Apple policy,&#8221; the motion states.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not content simply to remove Fortnite from the App Store, Apple is attacking Epic’s entire business in unrelated areas. Epic is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims, but without an injunction, Epic will be irreparably harmed long before final judgment comes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Epic ran afoul of both Apple and Google&#8217;s policies last week when it added a discounted direct payment option into its apps, essentially creating a workaround for Fortnite players to make purchases in the game without an intermediary. Knowing that Apple would act quickly to pull Fortnite from the Apple Store for violating its rules, Epic had a<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/\"> PR campaign against the tech giant</a> prepared, launching an antitrust suit and a Fortnite-themed spoof on Apple&#8217;s iconic 1984 commercial shortly after the news broke.</p>\n<p>When reached by TechCrunch, Apple did not provide additional comment on the latest development, pointing us back to its prior statement that the company will &#8220;make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations&#8221; and to get Fortnite back in the App Store.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: </strong>Apple provided a new statement on the Epic Games situation on Monday night:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>The App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users and a great business opportunity for all developers. Epic has been one of the most successful developers on the App Store, growing into a multibillion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS customers around the world. We very much want to keep the company as part of the Apple Developer Program and their apps on the Store. The problem Epic has created for itself is one that can easily be remedied if they submit an update of their app that reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which apply to all developers. We won’t make an exception for Epic because we don’t think it’s right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The full text of Epic&#8217;s injunction request to block Apple&#8217;s actions is available <a href=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-v-apple-8-17-20-768927327.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lThviNHw9O\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/fortnite-app-store-removed-apple/\">Apple boots Fortnite from the App Store after Epic adds direct payments</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Apple boots Fortnite from the App Store after Epic adds direct payments&#8221;

While the target customer for Lana may not be the same middle to upper-middle-class international traveler that he had previously hoped to serve, the challenges gig economy workers face in Latin America are much the same.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Muniz actually had two revelations from his work at Denizen. The first &#8212; he would never try to launch a fintech company in conjunction with a big bank. And the second was that fintechs or neobanks that focus on a very niche segment will be successful &#8212; so long as they can find the right niche.</p>\n<p>The biggest niche that Muniz saw that was underserved was actually in the gig economy space in Latin America. &#8220;I knew several people who worked at gig economy companies and I knew that their businesses were booming and the industry was growing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[But] I was concerned about the inequalities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Workers in gig economy marketplaces in Latin America often don&#8217;t have bank accounts and are paid through the apps on which they list their services in siloed wallets that are exclusive to that particular app. What Lana is hoping to do is become the wallet of wallets for all of the different companies on which laborers list their services. Frequently, drivers will work for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> or Cabify and deliver food for Rappi.

These accounts can be opened at local merchant shops and, once opened, workers will have access to a debit card that they can use at other locations.</p>\n<p>The Lana service also has a bill pay feature that it&#8217;s rolling out to users, in the first evolution of the product into a marketplace for financial services that would appeal to gig workers, Muniz said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to become that account in which they receive funds,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are still iterating the value proposition to gig economy companies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Working with companies like Cabify, and other, undisclosed companies, Lana has plans to roll out in Mexico, Chile, Peru and, eventually, Colombia and Argentina.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Lana hopes to move beyond basic banking services like deposits and payments and into credit services. Already hundreds of customers are using the company&#8217;s service through the distribution partnership with Cabify, which ran the initial pilot to determine the viability of the company&#8217;s offering.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea of creating Lana was initially tested as an internal project at <span class=\"il\">Cabify,&#8221; Muniz wrote in an email</span>. &#8220;Soon <span class=\"il\">Cabify</span> and some potential investors saw that Lana could have a greater impact as an independent company, being able to serve gig economy workers from any industry and decided to start over a new entrepreneurial project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through those connections with Cabify, Lana was able to bring in other investors like the Silicon Valley-based investment firm <a href=\"https://base10.vc/\">Base 10</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the things we&#8217;ve been interested in is in inclusion generally and in fintech specifically,&#8221; said Adeyemi Ajao, the firm&#8217;s co-founder. &#8220;We had gotten very close to investing in a couple of fintech companies in Latin America and that is because the opportunity is huge. There are several million people going from unbanked to banked in the region.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Along with a few other investors, Base 10 put in $12.5 million to finance Lana as it looks to expand. It&#8217;s a market that has few real competitors. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/nubank\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nubank\">Nubank, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Latin America&#8217;s biggest fintech company, is offering credit services across the continent, but most of their end users already have an established financial history.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of their end users are not unbanked,&#8221; said Ajao. &#8220;With Lana it is truly gig workers&#8230; They can start by being a wallet of wallets and then give customers products that help them finance their cars or their scooters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The ultimate idea is to get workers paid faster and provide a window into their financial history that can give them more opportunities at other gig economy companies, said Ajao. &#8220;The vision would be that someone can plug in their financial information for services. If they&#8217;re working for Rappi and have never been an Uber driver and they want to be an Uber driver, Lana can use their financial history with Rappi to offer a loan on a car,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>That financial history is completely inaccessible to a traditional bank, and those established financial services don&#8217;t care about the history built in wallets that they can&#8217;t control or track. &#8220;Today if you&#8217;ve been a gig worker and you go to a bank, that&#8217;s worth nothing,&#8221; said Ajao.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AZOh8EEcPC0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 19:52:59 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1224177241.jpg","linkMd5":"1b78adb2b63dccf5471f799607df5f76","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn93@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-02-49-440_18356e2418b82180.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":683,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1224177241.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn93@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-02-49-440_18356e2418b82180.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn2@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-02-49-063_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-190_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-284_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/18/06-03-03-330_21e9ef4640e5479b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AZOh8EEcPC0:jG9Pz2CTIyY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn90@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-04-325_300db33d9400c064.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn2@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-04-334_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AZOh8EEcPC0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn45@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-03-320_9c378f723f548916.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597730565544},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","title":"Meet the startup that helped Microsoft build the world of Flight Simulator","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2032098","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> new Flight Simulator is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/microsofts-new-flight-simulator-is-a-beautiful-work-in-progress/\">technological marvel</a> that sets a new standard for the genre.

As Putz told me, it was actually Stoked that set the company on the way to what would become Blackshark.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the first games we did in 2007 was a snowboarding game called Stoked and S Stoked Bigger Edition, which was one of the first games having a full 360-degree mountain where you could use a helicopter to fly around and drop out, land everywhere and go down,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The mountain itself was procedurally constructed and described &#8212; and also the placement of obstacles of vegetation, of other snowboarders and small animals had been done procedurally. Then we went more into the racing, shooting, driving genre, but we still had this idea of positional placement and descriptions in the back of our minds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bongfish returned to this idea when it worked on World of Tanks, simply because of how time-consuming it is to build such a huge map where every rock is placed by hand.</p>\n<p>Based on this experience, Bongfish started building an in-house AI team. That team used a number of machine-learning techniques to build a system that could learn from how designers build maps and then, at some point, build its own AI-created maps. The team actually ended up using this for some of its projects before Microsoft came into the picture.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ng-mGNqLe6M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>&#8220;By random chance, I met someone from Microsoft who was looking for a studio to help them out on the new Flight Simulator. The core idea of the new Flight Simulator simulator was to use <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bing\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bing\">Bing <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Maps as a playing field, as a map, as a background,&#8221; Putz explained.</p>\n<p>But Bing Maps&#8217; photogrammetry data only yielded exact 1:1 replicas of 400 cities &#8212; for the vast majority of the planet, though, that data doesn&#8217;t exist. Microsoft and Asobo Studios needed a system for building the rest.</p>\n<p>This is where Blackshark comes in. For Flight Simulator, the studio reconstructed 1.5 billion buildings from 2D satellite images.</p>\n<p>Now, while Putz says he met the Microsoft team by chance, there&#8217;s a bit more to this. Back in the day, there was a Bing Maps team in Graz, which developed the first cameras and 3D versions of Bing Maps. And while <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Maps won the market, Bing Maps actually beat Google with its 3D maps. Microsoft then launched a research center in Graz and when that closed, Amazon and others came in to snap up the local talent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So it was easy for us to fill positions like a PhD in rooftop reconstruction,&#8221; Putz said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know this existed, but this was exactly what we needed &#8212; and we found two of them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to see why reconstructing a 3D building from a 2D map would be hard. Even figuring out a building&#8217;s exact outline isn&#8217;t easy.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2032411\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2032411\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2032411\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg 2264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg?resize=768,344 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg?resize=1536,687 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg?resize=2048,916 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-091038.jpg?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2032411\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blackshark.ai</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;What we do basically in Flight Simulator is we look at areas, 2D areas and then finding out footprints of buildings, which is actually a computer vision task,&#8221; said Putz. &#8220;But if a building is obstructed by a shadow of a tree, we actually need machine learning because then it&#8217;s not clear anymore what is part of the building and what is not because of the overlap of the shadow &#8212; but then machine learning completes the remaining part of the building. That&#8217;s a super simple example.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Blackshark was able to rely on some other data, too, including photos, sensor data and existing map data, it has to make a determination about the height of the building and some of its characteristics based on very little information.</p>\n<p>The obvious next problem is figuring out the height of a building. If there is existing GIS data, then that problem is easy to solve, but for most areas of the world, that data simply doesn&#8217;t exist or isn&#8217;t readily available. For those areas, the team takes the 2D image and looks for hints in the image, like shadows. To determine the height of a building based on a shadow, you need the time of day, though, and the Bing Maps images aren&#8217;t actually timestamped. For other use cases the company is working on, Blackshark has that and that makes things a lot easier. And that&#8217;s where machine learning comes in again.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2032402\" style=\"width: 1606px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2032402\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2032402 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1596\" height=\"935\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg 1596w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092533-1.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1596px) 100vw, 1596px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2032402\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blackshark.ai</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;Machine learning takes a slightly different road,&#8221; noted Putz. &#8220;It also looks at the shadow, we think &#8212; because it&#8217;s a black box, we don&#8217;t really know what it&#8217;s doing. But also, if you look at a flat rooftop, like a skyscraper versus a shopping mall. Both have mostly flat rooftops, but the rooftop furniture is different on a skyscraper than on a shopping mall. This helps the AI to learn when you label it the right way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And then, if the system knows that the average height of a shopping mall in a given area is usually three floors, it can work with that.</p>\n<p>One thing Blackshark is very open about is that its system will make mistakes &#8212; and if you buy Flight Simulator, you will see that there are obvious mistakes in how some of the buildings are placed. Indeed, Putz told me that he believes one of the hardest challenges in the project was to convince the company&#8217;s development partners and Microsoft to let them use this approach.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talking 1.5 billion buildings. At these numbers, you cannot do traditional Q&#38;A anymore. And the traditional finger-pointing in like a level of Halo or something where you say ‘this pixel is not good, fix it,’ does not really work if you develop on a statistical basis like you do with AI. So it might be that 20% of the buildings are off &#8212; and it actually is the case I guess in the Flight Simulator &#8212; but there&#8217;s no other way to tackle this challenge because outsourcing to hand-model 1.5 billion buildings is, just from a logistical level and also budget level, not doable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over time, that system will also improve, and because Microsoft streams a lot of the data to the game from Azure, users will surely see changes over time.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2032409\" style=\"width: 1149px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-090907.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2032409\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2032409 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-090907.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1139\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-090907.jpg 1139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-090907.jpg?resize=150,48 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-090907.jpg?resize=300,96 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-090907.jpg?resize=768,245 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-090907.jpg?resize=680,217 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-17-090907.jpg?resize=50,16 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1139px) 100vw, 1139px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2032409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blackshark.ai</p></div></p>\n<p>Labeling, though, is still something the team has to do simply to train the model, and that&#8217;s actually an area where Blackshark has made a lot of progress, though Putz wouldn&#8217;t say too much about it because it&#8217;s part of the company&#8217;s secret sauce and one of the main reasons why it can do all of this with just about 50 people.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Data labels had not been a priority for our partners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so we used our own live labeling to basically label the entire planet by two or three guys [&#8230;] It puts a very powerful tool and user interface in the hands of the data analysts. And basically, if the data analyst wants to detect a ship, he tells the learning algorithm what the ship is and then he gets immediate output of detected ships in a sample image.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From there, the analyst can then train the algorithm to get even better at detecting a specific object like a ship, in this example, or a mall in Flight Simulator. Other geospatial analysis companies tend to focus on specific niches, Putz also noted, while the company&#8217;s tools are agnostic to the type of content being analyzed.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2032401\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092616-2.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2032401\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2032401\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092616-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092616-2.jpg 1209w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092616-2.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092616-2.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092616-2.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092616-2.jpg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-15-092616-2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2032401\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blackshark.ai</p></div></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s where Blackshark&#8217;s bigger vision comes in. Because while the company is now getting acclaim for its work with Microsoft, Blackshark also works with other companies around reconstructing city scenes for autonomous driving simulations, for example.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our bigger vision is a near-real-time digital twin of our planet, particularly the planet&#8217;s surface, which opens up a trillion use cases where traditional photogrammetry like a Google Earth or what Apple Maps is doing is not helping because those are just simplified for photos clued on simple geometrical structures. For this we have our cycle where we have been extracting intelligence from aerial data, which might be 2D images, but it also could be 3Dpoint counts, which are already doing another project. And then we are visualizing the semantics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those semantics, which describe the building in very precise detail, have one major advantage over photogrammetry: Shadow and light information is essentially baked into the images, making it hard to relight a scene realistically. Since Blackshark knows everything about that building it is constructing, it can then also place windows and lights in those buildings, which creates the surprisingly realistic night scenes in Flight Simulator.</p>\n<p>Point clouds, which aren&#8217;t being used in Flight Simulator, are another area Blackshark is focusing on right now. Point clouds are very hard to read for humans, especially once you get very close. Blackshark uses its AI systems to analyze point clouds to find out how many stories a building has.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole company was founded on the idea that we need to have a huge advantage in technology in order to get there, and especially coming from video games, where huge productions like in Assassin&#8217;s Creed or GTA are now hitting capacity limits by having thousands of people working on it, which is very hard to scale, very hard to manage over continents and into a timely delivered product. For us, it was clear that there need to be more automated or semi-automated steps in order to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And though Blackshark found its start in the gaming field &#8212; and while it is working on this with Microsoft and Asobo Studios &#8212; it&#8217;s actually not focused on gaming but instead on things like autonomous driving and geographical analysis. Putz noted that another good example for this is Unreal Engine, which started as a game engine and is now everywhere.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For me, having been in the games industry for a long time, it&#8217;s so encouraging to see, because when you develop games, you know how groundbreaking the technology is compared to other industries,&#8221; said Putz. &#8220;And when you look at simulators, from military simulators or industrial simulators, they always kind of look like shit compared to what we have in driving games. And the time has come that the game technologies are spreading out of the game stack and helping all those other industries. I think Blackshark is one of those examples for making this possible.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nWffZ86cuZ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/microsofts-new-flight-simulator-is-a-beautiful-work-in-progress/\">Microsoft&#8217;s new Flight Simulator is a beautiful work in progress</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s new Flight Simulator is a beautiful work in progress&#8221;

Apple said at the time that it would &#8220;make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/indian-lawmakers-accuse-facebook-of-political-bias/\">Facebook faces heat in India after report on hate speech posts</a> — The debate was sparked by a Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hate-speech-india-politics-muslim-hindu-modi-zuckerberg-11597423346\">report</a> claiming that Facebook’s top public-policy executive in India had opposed applying the company’s hate-speech rules to a member of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/pinterest-announces-first-black-board-member/\">Pinterest announces first Black board member</a> — Pinterest has appointed Andrea Wishom, president of real estate company Skywalker Holdings and former Harpo Studios executive, to its board of directors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/google-warns-users-in-australia-free-services-are-at-risk-if-its-forced-to-share-ad-revenue-with-big-media/\">Google warns users in Australia free services are at risk if it’s forced to share ad revenue with ‘big media’</a> — Google has fired a lobbying pot-shot at a looming change to the law in Australia that will force it to share ad revenue with local media businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Startups, funding and venture capital</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/deepfake-video-app-reface-is-just-getting-started-on-shapeshifting-selfie-culture/\">Deepfake video app Reface is just getting started on shapeshifting selfie culture</a> — Reface (previously Doublicat) is an app that uses AI-powered deepfake technology to let users try on another face/form for size.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/weee-35-million-raise-from-dst/\">DST Global pumps $35 million into Asian e-grocer Weee!</a> — The delightfully named startup delivers groceries, like fresh kimchi and Japanese desserts, to major cities across the U.S.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/amex-acquires-softbank-backed-kabbage-after-tough-2020-for-the-smb-lender/\">Amex acquires SoftBank-backed Kabbage after tough 2020 for the SMB lender</a> — Amex’s acquisition will include employees, technology and financial data, but “Kabbage’s pre-existing loan portfolio is not included in the purchase agreement.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Advice and analysis from Extra Crunch</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/founders-can-raise-funding-before-launching-a-product/\">Founders can raise funding before launching a product</a> — I spoke to Precursor Ventures&#8217; Charles Hudson about how to pitch VCs before you&#8217;ve built a real product.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/robinhood-raises-200m-more-at-11-2b-valuation-as-its-revenue-scales/\">Robinhood raises $200M more at $11.2B valuation as its revenue scales</a> — Robinhood already raised capital multiple times this year, including an initial $280 million round at an $8.3 billion valuation, and a later $320 million addition that brought its valuation to $8.6 billion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/how-tech-can-build-more-resilient-supply-chains/\">How tech can build more resilient supply chains</a> — Coatue&#8217;s Caryn Marooney recently made the jump into venture capital.</p>\n<p>(Reminder: Extra Crunch is our subscription membership program, which aims to democratize information about startups. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/\">You can sign up here</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Everything else</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/spacex-will-attempt-to-break-a-rocket-reusability-record-with-a-launch-this-week/\">SpaceX will attempt to break a rocket reusability record with a launch this week</a> — SpaceX is preparing for yet another launch of Starlink satellites on Tuesday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/us-commerce-department-updates-rules-to-further-limit-huaweis-chip-access/\">US Commerce Department updates rules to further limit Huawei’s chip access</a> — The new restrictions follow a similar decree announced in May.</p>\n<p><em>The Daily Crunch is TechCrunch&#8217;s roundup of our biggest and most important stories.

When the company announced it would re-launch the franchise just over a year ago, using a new graphics engine and satellite data from Bing Maps, it sure created a lot of hype among both old fans and those who had never played the older version but were drawn to the next-gen graphics the company showed off in its trailer. The good news is, the new <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Flight Simulator was worth the wait and, starting August 18, you&#8217;ll be able to see for yourself.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at $59.99 for the standard version of Flight Simulator on both the Microsoft Store and Steam. If you want access to more planes and hand-crafted airports, you will need to buy either the $89.99 deluxe version or, for even more of those, the $119.99 premium version. You can find the details of which airports and planes are included in each version <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/microsofts-flight-simulator-2020-will-launch-on-august-18/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Rest assured, though, especially if this is your first outing in Flight Simulator, with the base version you can still land at the same 36,000 airports as the others, and there are more than enough planes to keep you occupied &#8212; you&#8217;ll just miss out on a few extras (and if you really want to, you can buy upgrades to the more premium versions later).</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The cheapest way to give the game a spin is to subscribe to the Xbox Game Pass for a month, because the standard edition is now part of Microsoft&#8217;s subscription program, and if you&#8217;re a new subscriber, the first month only costs $1.</p>\n<p>I already dove pretty deeply <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/microsofts-new-flight-simulator-is-a-beautiful-work-in-progress/\">into the beta</a> a few weeks ago, but Microsoft provided me with an early review copy of the final release of the premium version, so it&#8217;s worth taking a second look at what you&#8217;ll get.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dT6gW9PDdi\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/microsofts-new-flight-simulator-is-a-beautiful-work-in-progress/\">Microsoft&#8217;s new Flight Simulator is a beautiful work in progress</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s new Flight Simulator is a beautiful work in progress&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/microsofts-new-flight-simulator-is-a-beautiful-work-in-progress/embed/#?secret=dT6gW9PDdi\" data-secret=\"dT6gW9PDdi\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The first thing everybody I showed the new sim to told me was how beautiful it looks. That&#8217;s true for the scenery, which includes a mix of cities reconstructed in every detail thanks to the photogrammetry data in Bing Maps and those Microsoft partner Blackshark.ai reconstructed from the 2D maps (for more on how that works, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/meet-the-startup-that-helped-microsoft-build-the-world-of-flight-simulator/\">here is our interview with Blackshark</a>). What makes this work is not just the realistic cities and towns, but also that they feel pretty alive, with traffic zipping down highways and local streets and street lights and even the windows of houses lighting up at night.</p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the weather model. Flight Simulator features the prettiest clouds you&#8217;ve ever seen in a game. Rain clouds in the distance look just like in real life. Wind acts realistically on your plane. If you fly in winter, snow covers the ground &#8212; and you can play around with all of those settings in real time without having to reload the game with every change.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2032100\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2032100\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2032100\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg 2242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg?resize=2048,1071 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2032100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>\n<p>But since Microsoft and Asobo Studios decided to almost build a digital twin of our planet in Flight Simulator &#8212; and because the only way to do that is to use machine learning instead of placing every object by hand &#8212; you&#8217;ll still find plenty of oddness in the world, too. I had hoped that the team would fix more of these between the beta and final release, but I haven&#8217;t seen a lot of changes here. That means you&#8217;ll find bridges that look more like dams, roads that go under water and a few misplaced buildings and trees &#8212; there are so many trees where they don&#8217;t belong.</p>\n<p>The way I look at this is that Flight Simulator is still a work in progress, and that hasn&#8217;t changed in the final release. I&#8217;m okay with that because even when there are mistakes, the cities and towns still usually look better than in any paid add-on for other flight simulators. Because a lot of this data is streamed from the Azure cloud and the team will continue to tweak its algorithms, I also expect that we&#8217;ll see fewer and fewer of these issues over time. Early on, I got hung up on this, but after a while, I realized that it doesn&#8217;t take away from enjoying the game &#8212; but it&#8217;s something to be aware of.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2032158\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg 2411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg?resize=768,379 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg?resize=680,335 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg?resize=1536,757 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg?resize=2048,1010 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>One area where I really hoped Microsoft would have improved the game, though, is air traffic control. This was always an area where Microsoft (and to be fair, all of its competitors) struggled. This was a problem during the alpha and beta, and it still is, which is really a shame, but what we have now just doesn&#8217;t feel very realistic.</p>\n<p>Air traffic controllers don&#8217;t use standard phraseology (no real-life controller will ever tell you that he will contact you next when you leave his airspace, for example), don&#8217;t hand you off from tower to departure and constantly tell everybody to go around. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve done more go-arounds in three days with the final version of Flight Simulator than during the entire training for my pilot&#8217;s license. That feels like something that could be easily improved in the next update because, maybe even more so than the occasional graphics hiccup, it breaks the immersion for those looking for a simulator experience.</p>\n<p>I also just wish that the controllers would call airlines by their real names. Microsoft has partnered with FlightAware to show real-life flights in the game, which depart and land on time, but somehow there are no liveries for them (except for the occasional stray United plane, which hints that we&#8217;ll see more of these over time) and only a limited set of models. Again, that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll probably see more of in future updates.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2032749\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/medium.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of those flight models, Microsoft tweaked some of them a bit since the beta and, while I&#8217;ve never been in the cockpit of a 787, the single-engine Cessnas that I&#8217;ve flown still behave like I would expect them to in the sim (though I find the rudder is still pretty twitchy and needs some tweaking). I can&#8217;t vouch for the other aircraft in the game, but I expect real live pilots will find they are similarly realistic.</p>\n<p>I still found some bugs with the flight instruments here and there and the GPS systems sometimes won&#8217;t let me activate a course, for example. I also wish the simulation of the G1000 and G3X glass cockpits would go just a little bit further. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if Microsoft and Asobo specifically held back here a bit to leave more room for add-on developers.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2032162\" style=\"width: 3850px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2032162\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2032162 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2032162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>\n<p>Performance hasn&#8217;t really changed since the beta, but I&#8217;m typically getting around 40 frames per second with the 2070 Super and i7-9700K, even when barely skimming over the roofs of cities like Barcelona or Berlin.</p>\n<p>The only time I&#8217;ve seen real dips down into the 20s is when flying low over some of the hand-crafted airports like Frankfurt, and even then, after turning around and flying over the airport again, those numbers shot back up to the 40s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2032157 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2177\" height=\"1411\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg 2177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg?resize=1536,996 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg?resize=2048,1327 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2177px) 100vw, 2177px\" /></a></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I used the words &#8220;simulator&#8221; and &#8220;game&#8221; interchangeably in this post. That&#8217;s because I think, in many ways, Flight Simulator is what you want it to be. There are plenty of game elements here, with flight training, landing challenges and bush-flying exercises. And in this age of COVID-19, there&#8217;s also something about it that just feels very relaxing when you&#8217;re flying around the planet low and slow, looking at the gorgeous scenery and forgetting about everything else for a while. I do worry, though, that most casual players will get bored after a short time.</p>\n<p>For simmers, the new Flight Simulator is a godsend and provides a great basis for their hobby for years to come, especially given that Microsoft will continue to update it and because a lot of companies will develop all kinds of add-ons for it &#8212; and thanks to the inherent flaws in the game, there&#8217;s still room for somebody to not just build additional aircraft but also handcrafted versions of smaller airports, for example.</p>\n<p>As I said in my preview, Flight Simulator is a technical marvel. Is it perfect? No. But I can forgive those imperfections because it does so much right.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/mupt7KS7Up4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 21:10:58 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg","linkMd5":"2984000d7c3edca52693006e320aecf1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-02-49-862_24bf08015cbfe112.webp","destWidth":2242,"destHeight":1172,"author":"Frederic Lardinois","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-14-180005.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-02-49-862_24bf08015cbfe112.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-174328.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn78@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-539_5e01c8da45e6bedd.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/medium.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn85@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-09-717_69686f00d1311686.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DetailAndFidelity15.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/18/06-03-04-278_4cf2bda1c2b2ede0.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Annotation-2020-08-16-183324.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn81@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-04-064_74ac61a789ee9e16.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn2@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-02-49-063_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-190_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-284_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn10@2020_4/2020/08/18/06-03-04-331_558078343fdf1970.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mupt7KS7Up4:GUtsk6ZC230:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn37@2020_1/2020/08/18/06-03-03-361_aecb2a472b0097db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn2@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-04-334_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/mupt7KS7Up4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn69@2020_1/2020/08/18/06-03-04-089_9c99d37c979e5477.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597730565545},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","title":"Pinterest announces first Black board member","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2032552","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"pinterest\">Pinterest <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has appointed Andrea Wishom, president of real estate company Skywalker Holdings* and former Harpo Studios executive, to its board of directors.

The walkout was a direct response to former Pinterest employees speaking out against gender and racial discrimination. Last week, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/\">former Pinterest COO Françoise Brougher sued</a> the company, alleging gender discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination. Prior to that, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erikashimizu/status/1272547227177713664\">Aerica Shimizu Banks</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ifeomaozoma/status/1272546213322080258\">Ifeoma Ozoma</a> also accused Pinterest of discrimination.</p>\n<p>“These are not isolated cases,” workers wrote in a petition. “Instead, they are representative of an organizational culture that hurts all Pinterest workers, and keeps us from achieving our mission of bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. We recognize that Pinterest has been a leader in diversity and inclusive hiring, with the diversity goals for new hires. It’s become clear that this is not enough, and that the diversity goals need to apply from the top down, not just the bottom up. Not only will diverse and inclusive leadership prevent discrimination and harassment among workers, it will help us build a product that is relevant on a global scale.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Employees are demanding full transparency about promotion levels and retention, total compensation package transparency, the people within two layers of reporting to the CEO to be at least 25% women and 8% underrepresented employees and a commitment to a diversity goal for the third layer reporting to the CEO.</p>\n<p>*An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Skywalker Holdings is a trampoline company. While that is true, Wishom works for a different Skywalker Holdings.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/7ZCCSM-Bw5E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 20:00:34 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Andrea-Wishom-credit-Erika-Dufour.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"886636c829fe307469b6b344efc75b48","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/18/06-03-06-825_b7f046a54c5675df.webp","metaImg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Andrea-Wishom-credit-Erika-Dufour.jpg?w=600","author":"Megan Rose Dickey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn2@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-02-49-063_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-190_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-284_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn34@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-03-336_503e209fa6fa5cfe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7ZCCSM-Bw5E:uSsC5OXaKso:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn97@2020_5/2020/08/18/06-03-04-369_0577170a4ebf8d7b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn2@2020_3/2020/08/18/06-03-04-334_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/7ZCCSM-Bw5E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/18/06-03-03-295_b6fd18d6c08c7ed2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597730565544},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 14:02:45","title":"A requiem for The Creamery","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2032496","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong><em> Ryan Lawler is a writer and editor based in Philadelphia.

If you actually wanted to have a discreet conversation, you sat at the back patio, which was frequently empty, barring the occasional lunch rush.</p>\n<p>But you didn’t go to The Creamery for the food.

Changing times, changing tastes and growing professionalism around the industry that made it a destination all meant The Creamery was not long for this world.</p>\n<p>As multithousandaires became multimillionaires and billionaires, the same comfort, convenience and unpretentiousness that defined the young tech industry evolved. Many techies outgrew their T-shirts and hoodies, decided they wanted something better than terrible coffee, and were no longer constrained by having to meet at the coffee shop closest to Caltrain.</p>\n<p>After all, most of the people they were meeting now also lived and worked in the city.</p>\n<p>This was accelerated by growing competition as both Philz and Reveille opened cafes just a few blocks away from The Creamery, with better coffee &#8212; and in the case of Reveille, <a href=\"https://sf.eater.com/2016/2/24/11110776/reveille-coffee-cafe-mission-bay-open\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sf.eater.com/2016/2/24/11110776/reveille-coffee-cafe-mission-bay-open&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1597768539028000&#38;usg=AFQjCNGpjPSwawbYl7yUNJoRglDCR9CaOA\"><em>much</em> better food</a>. Meanwhile, the new hotspot for being seen talking to investors was the South Park Blue Bottle, which was attached to General Catalyst’s SF office and just a few steps away from VCs like Redpoint and Kleiner Perkins.</p>\n<p>And for the folks who wanted the benefit of being able to have discreet conversations while also being seen among the tech elite, there was The Battery, which came to define the industry’s transition to excess.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the idea of a one-story cafe sitting on a plot of mostly empty land seemed verboten in a city in desperate need of new housing. And building that housing across the street from the main access point to the South Bay made nothing but sense.

Today, the company has additionally launched its own online informational hub and a new Twitter account designed to give it a dedicated platform for its collected responses, including those where it may need to respond more quickly &#8212; perhaps in response to the president&#8217;s tweets, for example, or with other breaking news.</p>\n<p>On Monday, TikTok launched <a href=\"https://www.tiktokus.info/\">tiktokus.info</a>, a website that organizes the company&#8217;s statements, news coverage, &#8220;expert opinions,&#8221; FAQs and other resources in a single destination. Oddly titled &#8220;The Last Sunny Corner of the Internet,&#8221; TikTok makes the case for its app as a place where millions express themselves creatively. It also goes on record to flatly deny that it would ever provide TikTok U.S. user data to the Chinese government. And it spells out its commitments to areas like user safety and security, as well as its commitments to combating election misinformation and interference, among other things.</p>\n<p>TikTok also strongly refers to the growing concerns over U.S. user privacy and security as &#8220;rumors and misinformation&#8221; that are &#8220;proliferating in Washington and in the media.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The app, in the months leading up to the executive order, had become the subject of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-cfius-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-opens-national-security-investigation-into-tiktok-sources-idUSKBN1XB4IL\">a national security investigation</a> in the U.S. due to its Chinese ownership. Despite TikTok&#8217;s proclamations that it would never share U.S. user data with China&#8217;s government, a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/open-sourced/2019/12/16/21013048/tiktok-china-national-security-investigation\">Chinese law introduced in 2017</a> requires Chinese companies to do just that, when asked, raising concerns about to what extent TikTok would be able to decline such a request.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-tracked-user-data-using-tactic-banned-by-google-11597176738?mod=e2tw\">a more recently published investigation by The WSJ found</a> that TikTok had been tracking Android user data, specifically users&#8217; MAC addresses, using a tactic that was in violation of Google&#8217;s Play Store policies and obfuscated using &#8220;an unusual added layer encryption.&#8221; TikTok ended the practice last November after 15 months of data collection, the report said. However, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission considers the MAC address &#8220;personally identifiable information&#8221; under some privacy laws.</p>\n<p>Beyond its round-up of on-the-record statements attributed to both TikTok and its execs, including TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer, the new website highlights any coverage it deems favorable. These links range from pro-TikTok op-eds that come out against the Trump E.O. to mere write-ups about this or that TikTok star&#8217;s success, or those that detail how advertisers and brands are using TikTok&#8217;s ad technology to reach consumers. These are bundled underneath the website&#8217;s &#8220;expert opinions&#8221; section, which also features statements from civil liberties organizations and others, like the ACLU, Information Technology &#38; Innovation Foundation, Internet Governance Project and more.</p>\n<p>The website&#8217;s FAQ section answers questions like &#8220;has TikTok ever shared user data with the Chinese government?&#8221; and well, &#8220;would it,&#8221; if asked? Both questions are answered, not surprisingly, &#8220;no.&#8221; It also clarifies that TikTok U.S. user data is stored in Virginia, with a back-up in Singapore and strict controls on employee access.</p>\n<p>The company also launched &#8220;@tiktok_comms&#8221; on Twitter to share news and updates from the TikTok Communications Team. While it&#8217;s common for companies to have a social media presence to share their news, this account&#8217;s launch in particular seems designed with the goal of being able to more quickly react to changes and updates surrounding its U.S. ban, which has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369753/bytedance-tiktok-trump-china-app-privacy-90-days\">already been extended</a> to 90 days after the issuing of the E.O., instead of 45 days, as before.</p>\n<p>Creating a dedicated website to tout a company&#8217;s official position on a topic has become a more common tactic now that world governments are more actively involving themselves in the tech industry&#8217;s business. Apple, for instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/apples-new-app-store-website-takes-aim-at-antitrust-anti-competitive-claims/\">launched a website</a> to defend its App Store against U.S. antitrust complaints. Google today even co-opted its main Search page to lobby against a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/google-warns-users-in-australia-free-services-are-at-risk-if-its-forced-to-share-ad-revenue-with-big-media/\">change to a law in Australia</a> that would force it to share ad revenues with media businesses.</p>\n<p>But the new website isn&#8217;t the only way TikTok has been fighting back to retain its place in the key U.S. market. The company also reportedly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/08/900394707/tiktok-to-sue-trump-administration-over-ban-as-soon-as-tuesday\">plans</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/09/tiktok-is-reportedly-planning-to-challenge-the-trump-administration-ban/\">challenge the constitutionality of the ban</a> in a lawsuit. Plus, U.S. TikTok employees <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-employees-trump-lawsuits/\">are planning</a> their own legal challenge to the ban &#8212; all news of which will likely soon hit the new website and Twitter, we&#8217;d wager.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=haIj_MOhVM0:OjjleKQNyew:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img
