Airtel and Vodafone-Idea can increase data and voice charges by 10%, and this can happen sooner than expected.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out the reason why this looks like a possibility?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Airtel, Vodafone-Idea Increasing Data, Voice Charges?</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per some unnamed sources, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea can increase their data and voice charges by 10%.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new increase in tariff can happen by September or October, as per the source.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>News18 <a href=\"https://www.news18.com/news/tech/airtel-vodafone-ideas-prepaid-postpaid-plans-may-cost-more-from-next-month-report-2786813.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">reported</a>: “Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea are reportedly considering a new round of tariff hikes as early as September, according to ‘exclusive sources’ who spoke anonymously to CNBC-TV18. “<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then last round of tariff increase happened last year, when every telecom operator in India increased their charges by 10-40%, including Jio.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, the question which arises now: Why Airtel and Vodafone-Idea are planning to raise tariff now?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>AGR Dues Are The Main Reason For New Tariff Hike</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the reports, the massive adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of the telecom operators are the main reason why Airtel and Vodafone-Idea can be compelled to raise tariff for all users.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to offset the AGR dues by the telcos to the Govt, they can hike tariff by minimum of 10% for both data and voice.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Infact, a critical Supreme Court ruling regarding the pending AGR dues are expected yesterday, which could have triggered the price hike immediately.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that didnt happen.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is expected that the Supreme Court can allow payments in installments, over the next few years.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Airtel and Vodafone-Idea have appealed to extend te payment deadline to next 20 years, since the Govt has sufficient securities from the telcos which can be used to pay the pending AGR dues.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, Supreme Court asked why Jio shouldn’t be left out of the AGR dues, if they have used RCom’s spectrum for three years.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are awaiting more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

Loses Election</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 15, India’s 74th Independence day, Joe Biden’s campaign with a bid to win over the Indian population in the US said that if Biden administration were to come to power in the November general elections it will reform the H-1B visa system.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will work towards eliminating the country-quota system for Green Cards, the campaign stated.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out how this will affect the Indian-American population…<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biden Winning Over Indian-Americans!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden campaign released a major policy document for Indian-Americans.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This move by a democratic presidential candidate coming out with an exclusive policy document for Indian-Americans has happened for the very first time.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States of America has over 1.3 billion Indian-American voters across eight battleground states.&#160;&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a largely immigrant community, but in some cases with American roots reaching back generations, Indian-Americans know firsthand the strength and resilience that immigrants bring to the US, the campaign said.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What will Biden’s campaign plan to work on to help Indian-Americans?</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Family-based immigration and preserve family unification as a core principle, which includes reducing the family visa backlog, his campaign said.</li><li>Increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration based on macroeconomic conditions. These will be exceptional from any cap recent graduates of Ph.D. programs in STEM fields.</li><li>Restore and defend the naturalization process for Green Cardholders by eliminating the limits on employment-based Green Cards by country.</li><li>End of workplace raids and protection to other sensitive locations from immigration enforcement actions.</li><li>Revokement of Trump’s Muslim ban. </li><li>&#8220;He will immediately begin working with Congress to pass legislative immigration reform that modernises our system, with a priority on keeping families together by providing a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants — including more than 500,000 from India,” the <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/joe-biden-promises-to-reform-h-1b-visa-system-eliminate-country-quota-for-green-cards-5710721.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">campaign</a> said.</li><li>During the Obama-Biden administration, the FBI expanded its hate crime statistics program to include Sikhs, Hindus, and Buddhists. As President, Biden will directly address the rise in hateful attacks and enact legislation prohibiting someone convicted of a hate crime from purchasing or possessing a firearm, it said. Increase in the potential sentence for hate crimes in houses of worship and other religious community sites, such as gurdwaras, mandirs, temples, and mosques, it said.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p> Trump imposing the visa ban with a view to creating jobs for American citizens has already caused a huge stir within the Indians living in the US as well as India. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be interesting to watch the November general election results where on one hand Biden is trying to win over the immigrant population and on the other Trump is trying to restrict the immigrants right from the start of his &#8216;rule&#8217; with the visa ban among his recent of many other tricks!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/16/more-h-1b-visas-will-be-rolled-out-no-restriction-on-green-card-if-trump-loses-election/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">More H-1B Visas Will Be Rolled Out, No Restriction On Green Card If Trump Loses Election</a> first appeared on Trak.in .

There have been discussions about States of the state-run carrier <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2019/12/31/air-india-will-shut-down-in-6-months-if-its-not-sold-rs-60000-cr-debt-of-air-india-is-now-unbearable/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Air India being sold off by the government.&#160;</a><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the news is that the TATA Group is planning to take over Air India by bidding for it under the Government’s plans of disinvestment.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out all the details right here!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Tata Group To Take Over Air India; Initiated Due Diligence Already</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As revealed by new developments, the TATA Group has already initiated due diligence on Air India and will be formally bidding close to the deadline announced officially which is at the end of this month.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spokesperson of the Tata group <a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/amp/business-economy/industry/article/tata-sons-to-make-bid-for-air-india-due-diligence-underway-for-ailing-state-run-airline/636773?utm_campaign=fullarticle&#38;utm_medium=referral&#38;utm_source=inshorts\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">confirmed the news</a>, saying, “Tata Sons is currently evaluating the proposal and will consider a bid after due consideration and at the appropriate time. There is no plan to bring in a financial partner.”<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The airline was actually formed as a division of Tata Sons Ltd. in 1932 and was operated as Tata airlines until 1946. After 1946, the airline became a public limited company and it was renamed to Air India.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, after facing heavy losses, the government decided to put up 76% off Air India for sale. However, this sale failed to bring in success which led to the government abandoning the sale of the airline altogether.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reattempting the sale of Air India, the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2019/11/18/air-india-bharat-petroleum-will-be-sold-to-private-firms-before-march-2020-govt-pushes-more-disinvestment/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">announced an ambitious plan</a> of selling off Air India to private players by March 2020.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, which obstructed the economic activities across the globe, the Centre announced an extension of the deadline to submit an expression of interest (EoI). In June, the Centre announced that the deadline would be August 31, when Tata Group would be making the bid.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>TATA Group Looking To Merge AirAsia India And Air India</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Air India is available for sale as one big company including the Air India express which is a low cost subsidiary of the airline and the real estate assets. There are some other interested buyers who want the Air India express to be sold separately which will help them bid for the low cost carrier.&#160;&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per reports, Tata sons holds 51% stake in AirAsia India and is planning to merge the two companies after buying out joint venture partner Tony Fernandes.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of March 31 2019, Air India has a total debt of Rs. 60,074 crores, the TATA Group would be required to absorb Rs. 23,286.5 crores. Apparently, the remaining amount would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/15/tata-sons-can-buy-air-india-will-air-india-return-to-tata/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Tata Sons Can Buy Air India &#038; Merge It With AirAsia To Challenge IndiGo, SpiceJet; Will Air India &#8216;Return&#8217; To Tata?</a> first appeared on Trak.in .

US Govt Reopens H1B Visa Lottery As They Fail To Get Enough Applications; H1B Visa Losing Its Charm?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As per new reports, coming in, the USCIS will be reopening the H-1B lottery now as the number of petitions was not sufficient and failed to meet the annual cap.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens now? Read on for more information on the lottery for H-1B reopening right here!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>USCIS Reopens H-1B Visa Lottery As The Number Of Petitions Doesn&#8217;t Meet Annual Target</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we all know, the H-1B visa is handed out through a lottery process which is conducted by randomly selecting the required number of H-1B applicants from a huge amount of applicants. Also, there is a cap on the number of applications that are submitted to the H-1B lottery pool. The cap for the financial year 2021 was 85000.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However as the target for the number of petitions wasn&#8217;t reached, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced that they will be reopening the H-1B lottery.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/uscis-reopens-h-1b-lottery-as-petitions-for-fy21-decline-due-to-covid-19-5705381.html/amp\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">statement</a>, they said, “The USCIS determined that additional registrations needed to be selected to reach the numerical allocations. A selection of previously submitted electronic registrations was completed on August 11.”<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new H-1B Electronic Registration Process required that employers should register with the USCIS by March 20. The lottery process starts after this deadline. Once the lottery is finished, potential beneficiaries who can start the process of application are announced by the agency.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Time to File Petition For H-1B Visa Starts On August 17: USCIS</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per reports, after the lottery selection in March, the H-1B visa aspirants were given a three month window that started from April 1 and ended on June 30 to file their applications. The cap on these applications was 65000 in regular quota and 20000 in advanced quota.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 2.67 lakh people had registered for the lottery and the candidates for the second lottery have been selected from these registrations by the USCIS. As per USCIS, those who wish to file petitions for H-1B Visa can do so between the time period of August 17 and November 16.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per reports, this is an incident that has never happened before. Apparently all the petitions would be filed within only a few days and the situation might have happened because of the global battle with the coronavirus pandemic.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/15/shocking-us-govt-reopens-h1b-visa-lottery-as-they-fail-to-get-enough-applications-h1b-losing-charm/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Shocking!

Via 100% Online Recruitment: How?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Very interesting and positive development coming in from the recruitment sector in India. <br><br>One major IT company has hired 12,000 Indian employees, and the entire hiring process has been done digitally. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out how this happened?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Teleperformance Hired 12,000 Employees</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IT and ITeS major Teleperformance has announced that they hired 12,000 employees in the last three months in India.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note here, that India was under lockdown since March, which got relaxed in the month of July. Hence, these 12,000 employees were hired during the lockdown, amidst coronavirus pandemic.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly an achievement.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teleperformance has more than 70,000 employees in India right now, and 70% of them are working from home as of now.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how did this happen?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Teleperformance’s Online Recruitment Drive</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Entire fleet of 12,000 new employees were hired via digital and online recruitment by Teleperformance, and this is the secret of their hiring process.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right from recruitment to on-boarding, training and deployment happened digitally, without any need to visit their office.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aditya Arora, chief executive officer of Teleperformance India <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/bpo-firm-teleperformance-hires-over-12000-people-in-last-three-months-using-digital-hiring-strategy/articleshow/77540189.cms#:~:text=Bengaluru%3A%20Teleperformance%20has%20hired%20over,new%20India%20head%20told%20ET.\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">confirmed</a> this, as he said, “In the last three months, we have hired upwards of 12,000 on our cloud campus model. Here the recruitment, training, learning and performance management is all handled online. Because of this, we have been able to reach out to Tier-2 cities,”<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reportedly, maximum hiring done by Teleperformance in the last three months happened at Tier 2 and 3 cities, where they don’t even have a presence.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using digital recruitment strategies, Teleperformance hired maximum employees from non-metro, and deployed them at client’s live projects seamlessly.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big lesson and case study for all IT and ITeS, BPO companies in India.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, the hiring process also gave priority to the ex-employees of Teleperformance first, most of them had to leave metros and find shelter at their home towns due to the pandemic.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since entire hiring process was done virtually, the company was able to wrap up recruitment process seamlessly, and fast.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Teleperformance has more than 3.3 lakh employees globally.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will keep you updated, as more details come in.&#160;<br></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/16/this-it-company-hired-12000-employees-in-last-3-months-via-100-online-recruitment-how/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">This IT Company Hired 12,000 Employees In Last 3 Months Via 100% Online Recruitment: How?</a> first appeared on Trak.in .

competition, cost optimization and several other reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in a recent corrigendum (correction of error) issued by the ministry of railways, it has been clarified that the decision of pricing on journeys by <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/07/10/5-advantages-of-private-trains-in-india-more-jobs-on-demand-trains-technology-more/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">private trains</a>, shall be under complete discretion of the private concessionaire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s\nunderstand this in detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Queries by Private Players to the Ministry of Railways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Private train operations in India are scheduled to begin by 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According\nto the MoR, private companies&#160;will run such 151 trains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are about <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/07/05/tata-adani-essel-group-can-run-150-private-trains-in-india-jobs-will-increase-says-railway-board/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">23 private organisations</a> that are showing positive interests in running these private trains. Some of them are Siemens Limited, Alstom Transport India Ltd and Bombardier Transportation India.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In\na pre-bid meeting on Wednesday, the participating private firms put up several\nqueries to the MoR, regarding bidding process, fares, operations, maintenance\nand several other concerns related to private trains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One\nmajor query raised was for the ministry to clarify whether the potential\nbuyer would have to run/approve the selected fare by a government regulatory\nbody.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Respone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To this query, the ministry responded via a corrigendum document to the private players,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As\nmentioned, fares are not proposed to be regulated and Private Train Operators\n(PTOs) will have the flexibility to determine the fares. To address the\ninflation impact, PTO(s) may consider increasing the tariffs/ fares. However,\nit may be noted that PTO(s) would be operating in a competitive environment,\nand PTO(s) ability to increase tariffs/ fares may be constrained”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, the <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/07/08/book-preferred-berths-in-private-trains-like-in-airlines-train-fare-will-be-more/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">ministry</a> made it very clear that the “fare will be market-driven and no approval is contemplated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,\nVK Yadav, the railway board chairman has clarified that the\nministry shall set up a said regulatory authority, in future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The private trains will map over 100 key routes across India and the fares for such train journeys will be exclusively <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/07/02/indian-railways-want-150-private-trains-on-109-routes-rs-30000-cr-investment-expected-via-privatization/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">market driven</a> and shall not subject to any approval from a regulatory body.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/14/fares-on-private-trains-for-100-routes-can-be-anything-govt-will-not-regulate-fares/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Fares On Private Trains For 100+ Routes Can Be Anything; Govt Will Not Regulate Fares!</a> first appeared on Trak.in .

If you apply for a new passport or re-issue of a current one in 2021, you will likely get the e-passport.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This move might reduce the forgery as e-passports will be difficult to forge and help faster immigration for the passengers.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The e-passports will follow the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.<br></p><div class='code-block code-block-6 ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>\n<script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<!-- Desktop-Post-Middle-336X280-TextImage-2016 -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n     style=\"display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px\"\n     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2220101849054001\"\n     data-ad-slot=\"6545105799\"></ins>\n<script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/e-passports-for-all-indian-citizens-next-year-onwards-govt-works-on-it-backbone/articleshow/77516854.cms#:~:text=After%20issuing%2020%2C000%20official%20and,to%20implement%20the%20big%20project.\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">ET</a> report indicated that all 36 passport offices in India will issue e-passports after the components of the personalization system are installed in the current issuance system.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The e-passports will be incorporated without any disturbances to the current system and also without any increase in the current issuance time.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 24, the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar while emphasizing the need to speed up the launch of e-passports had <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/e-passports-for-all-indian-citizens-from-2021-report-5694671.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">said</a> their introduction will greatly strengthen the security of Indian travel documents.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaishankar also said that the ministry is working with Indian Security Press, Nashik, and National Informatics Centre for e-passports with advanced security features.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Will Passport Issuing Process Speed Up With the E-Passports?</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Centre is looking for an agency to set up the IT infrastructure for the big project which will issue 10,000-20,000 e-passports per hour.&#160; IT systems will be set up in Delhi and Chennai to handle the load, the report stated.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The e-passports generated on a trial basis until now were issued only from Consular, Passport, and Visa (CPV) Division at  <br>Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) headquarters.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>ET report also stated that The National Informatics Centre, which is working in tandem with the MEA, has issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) on August 12 to select an agency to set up the IT Infrastructure for the e-passports.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RFP reads, “It will require a completely dedicated set-up and processes for e-passport document issuance.

as it spreads its wings in the key growth market by l<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/now-amazon-will-deliver-medicines-to-you/articleshow/77539072.cms\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">aunching an online pharmacy</a> in India on Friday.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Amazon Pharmacy</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, the company plans to serve the southern city of Bengaluru.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/08/amazon-freedom-sale-offers-top-10-deals-on-smart-tvs-smartphones/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Amazon.com</a> Inc.’s online pharmacy, Amazon Pharmacy, has been rolled out in Bengaluru.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company allows its customers to order home medical supplies, prescription medication, supplements, ayurvedic medicines and healthcare devices, among others, according to its website.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, before placing orders, the customers will have to upload the medical prescription.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement, Amazon said that the service, &#8220;Amazon Pharmacy&#8221;, will offer both over-the-counter and prescription-based drugs, basic health devices and traditional Indian herbal medicines.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the launch timeline details are not clear.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Amazon’s Competition With Rivals</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an ongoing competition between the rivals like Walmart-owned Flipkart, billionaire Mukesh Ambani&#8217;s upstart online grocery service JioMart and a range of other smaller players.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the pandemic, it is clear that demand for <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/07/14/swiggy-zomato-amazon-starts-alcohols-home-delivery-age-proof-check-delivery-charges/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">grocery, alcohol </a>and last but, not the least medicins will never end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the former two Amazon has already entered, with this new launch of the pharmacy product line, will definitely help in thriving the business.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from this, <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/08/netflix-amazon-prime-disneyhotstar-140-cheaper-in-india-shocking-reason-why/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Amazon </a>decided to open 10 new warehouses in India and start offering auto insurance last month.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, the company had also secured clearance for alcohol delivery in one Indian state, Reuters reported in June.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Protest Against Online Pharmacy</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, India is yet to finalize regulations for online drug sales, or e-pharmacies.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we can not avoid the growth of several online sellers like Netmeds, Medlife, Temasek-backed PharmEasy, and Sequoia Capital-backed 1mg which has already has started threatening the position of traditional drug stores.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In their defense, Amazon said that they comply with all Indian laws as many trader groups continue to protest against e-pharmacies, saying that would lead to the sale of medicines without proper verification.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legal head of South Chemists and Distributors Association in New Delhi, Yash Aggarwal said, &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s customer base is very high, so we are bound to lose business. There are 5 million families dependent on this (offline) trade,&#8221;.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, he said that the group will raise objections against Amazon&#8217;s move with the government.<br></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/15/amazon-india-will-sell-medicines-prescription-ayurveda-medicines-can-be-bought-on-amazon/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Amazon India Will Sell Medicines: Prescription, Ayurveda Medicines Can Be Bought On Amazon</a> first appeared on Trak.in .

Out The Skills You Need For Job</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the pandemic scenario, the new priorities for many businesses are affecting the demand for the types of technical skills requirements.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Which Technical Skills Are In-Damnd?</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is,<a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/11/jobs-are-back-as-companies-increase-hiring-firms-are-opting-for-remote-recruitment-now/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"> hiring is back</a> and mostly security, organizational change and cloud computing are at the top of the list.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the research by tech recruiter Harvey Nash, some of the skills that are in most demands from IT chiefs include enterprise architecture, cybersecurity, technical architecture, organizational change and cloud.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that there is a shift compared to last year&#8217;s survey IT chiefs, as it listed big data and analytics being the skills most in-demand, then comes cybersecurity, enterprise architecture, technical architecture and DevOps.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Does Expert Say?</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sectors which are less affected by the coronavirus like pharmaceuticals, logistics, healthcare and tech continue to <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/04/big-shock-for-indian-techies-h1b-visa-outsourcing-banned-for-us-govt-jobs/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">create jobs</a>,<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/tech-jobs-are-growing-again-but-the-top-skills-companies-want-are-changing/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\"> according to Bev White</a>, chief executive of Harvey Nash.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the companies research discovered that 82% of <a href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/07/capgemini-is-hiring-24000-indian-it-employees-reskill-50000-staff-in-these-areas/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">IT leaders </a>in the UK expect their staff headcount to increase or stay the same.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, he said that the Technical sector has been a more insulated sector from the impact of COVID-19 and this further helped the businesses in easily shifting towards remote working.<br></p><div class='code-block code-block-6 ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear:

[]).push({});\n</script></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>White said, &#8220;As a result, we have only seen the tech recruitment market slow for permanent positions, but even here, things are starting to pick-up again &#8212; particularly for software developers, helpdesk advisors, cloud architects and cybersecurity specialists,&#8221;.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What About Fresh Recruitment?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month’s figures from the Recruitment &#38; Employment Confederation (REC) show that the number of companies preparing to hire tech workers is increasing again after a sharp fall during the lockdown.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the job postings for web designers, programmers and software developers increasing now.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the result of companies trying to adapt to a changing market, according to REC.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not-for-profit/charity, financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, and technology are the sector which has shown the most promising response in recruiting tech professionals over the next 12 months include.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ONS, more than one million people work in IT and telecoms in the UK, in which over 330,000 programmers and software developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While 240,000 employees working in operations and user support, 100,100 IT and telecoms directors, 189,000 IT managers, 140,000 business analysts and architects, and 60,000 web designers.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roughly you can consider that over three million people work across the broader UK technology industry.<br></p>\n<p>The

Under Rs 700: Eligibility, Locations, Pack Details</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The state-owned telecom provider, BSNL, has now launched 3 new Bharat Fiber plans in its Punjab circle, and these plans would offer a speed of 50 Mbps.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of these plans by BSNL comes with calling facilities, whereas the other two come without any calling facilities.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out all the details about BSNL’s three new plans right here!&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>BSNL Launches Three New Plans: Browse The Internet At 50 Mbps Speed</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has launched three new plans under the Bharat Fiber plans that will offer 50 Mbps speed in its Punjab circle. BSNL announced these plans pn the BSNL Punjab site named as&#160; “200 GB CS111 Monthly,” “300 GB CS112 Monthly” and “PUN 400 GB Monthly.”<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The base plan is the 200 GB CS111 plan, and in this plan, BSNL has reduced his pricing as compared to the 100 GB CUL plan.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 100 GB CUL plan has been launched as a base plan by BSNL and it allows users to browse up to 20 Mbps speed till the 100 GB limit, after which the company offers 2 Mbps speed. This plan also offers unlimited calling facility to any network across the country. This plan has been priced at Rs. 499 per month.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>200GB CS111 Monthly plan</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the 200GB CS111 Monthly plan offers users the ability to browse up to 50 MBPS speed under they reach 200 GB after which the speed reduces to 4mbps. BSNL does not offer voice calling facility to the users who subscribed to this plan. Also, the 200GB CS111 Monthly plan is priced at Rs. 490 per month by BSNL.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>300GB CS112 Monthly plan</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another plan that BSNL will be offering is the 300GB CS112 Monthly plan, which will be launched at Rs. 590 per month. This plan offers 300 GB data at 50 MBPS speed and once the cap is reached the speed is reduced to 4 Mbps.&#160; As in the case of the 200GB CS111 Monthly plan, this plan also does not come with any voice calling facilities for the users to subscribe to the CS112 plan.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third plan launched by BSNL is the PUN 400GB Monthly plan which will be priced at Rs. 690 per month. Those subscribers who opt for this plan will be able to enjoy 50 Mbps speed till they reach the 400 GB target. After this target is met, BSNL will offer a speed of 4 Mbps.

This was a necessary move in order to prevent any further spreading of the dangerous virus.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a survey has revealed that employees aren’t too happy about working from home, and have revealed that they don’t want to work from home more than three days a week.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out what all the employees have to say in the survey right here!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>No Employees Want To Work From Home Permanently;82 Percent People Prefer WFH For One Day</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This survey was the <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/covid-19-impact-82-employees-want-to-work-from-home-for-just-over-a-day-5705391.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">first global ‘Work From Home” survey</a> launched by Colliers’ global Workplace Advisory team and was introduced in March. The survey revealed that once the situation normalizes, 82 percent of employees preferred to work from home only for over a day in a week.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas, there are no employees who want to work from home for more than three days in a week. Of those employees who never worked from home before, 85 percent would like to work remotely for at least one day a week after COVID-19.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, 72&#160; percent of employees have opined that they feel that working from home would be more productive. 25 percent of employees have said that they conduct social breaks with their colleagues digitally whereas 25 percent of employees put their cameras to use during online meetings. The survey also said that 67 percent of employees the in-person collaboration.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Work-Life Balance Increased Due To Work From Home; Living Arrangements Affect Productivity</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, 63 percent of employees have said that they have experienced an enhancement in their work-life balance ever since they started working from home. 89 percent of employees said that their managers trusted them during the lock down when they were working from home.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another insight that the survey has revealed is that living arrangements affect productivity as well. Apparently employees who lived alone showed significant boost in their productivity where are those employees who had their social breaks and meeting with colleagues at fixed time have shown 25 percent increase in productivity.&#160;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees have also said that individual tasks have been carried out better at home, whereas collaborative work is done better at the workplace. 83 percent of employees felt that they remained connected to their team despite the distancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trak.in/tags/business/2020/08/16/employees-hate-work-from-home-no-employee-wants-more-than-3-days-of-working-from-home-survey/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Employees Hate Work From Home!
