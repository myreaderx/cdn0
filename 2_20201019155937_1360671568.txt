It let you flag certain contacts as \"trusted,\" and those people could then request your location in an emergency situation. The base functionality was not all that different from Google Maps location sharing, but when Trusted Contacts launched in 2016—the Google+ dark ages—Google Maps did not have location sharing built in. (Google Latitude, the original Google Maps location sharing functionality, debuted in 2009, but that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/as-latitude-falls-3-more-services-google-may-kill-for-the-sake-of-google/\">was killed in 2013</a> in favor of Google+ location sharing. Google+ was on the way out by 2016, and location sharing returned to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/location-sharing-finally-returns-to-google-maps/\">Google Maps in 2017</a>.) The one addition besides a proactive location sharing was for a trusted contact to declare an emergency location request, which the other user would have to deny or it would automatically share.</p>\n<p>The app has a 3.8 rating <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.emergencyassist\">on the Play Store</a> and over a million downloads, which is not good enough to save it from the Google grim reaper. Google <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thattridentdude/status/1317146576276553729/photo/1\">sent out emails</a> to users saying that since location sharing was now built into Google Maps, the Trusted Contacts app was no longer need. The app will shut down in just 43 days, on December 1, 2020.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715661#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715661&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=G4Jfm_4u0Qw:XsGsao42Sjg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=G4Jfm_4u0Qw:XsGsao42Sjg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=G4Jfm_4u0Qw:XsGsao42Sjg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=G4Jfm_4u0Qw:XsGsao42Sjg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=G4Jfm_4u0Qw:XsGsao42Sjg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=G4Jfm_4u0Qw:XsGsao42Sjg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:37:20 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/trusted_0004_Background.jpg","linkMd5":"56c7a526b25ce41e8d131a36841837e0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-03-711_6641592893178416.webp","destWidth":506,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":98617,"destBytes":34308,"author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/trusted_0004_Background.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-03-711_6641592893178416.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=G4Jfm_4u0Qw:XsGsao42Sjg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-27-779_c80292296fa5ba1b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=G4Jfm_4u0Qw:XsGsao42Sjg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn72@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-15-780_97d122a2e07ac0a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn80@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-15-700_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn33@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-16-086_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123138122},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:58","title":"SSC takes Bugatti’s crown with a new 316mph production car speed record","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715641","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIPMAN_89354-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          On October 9, SSC North American took the production speed record away from Bugatti with a 331mph top speed run in the SSC Tuatara.

On October 10, racing driver Oliver Webb got behind the wheel of one of SSC's new Tuatara hypercars and, on a closed stretch of Nevada State Route 160, reached a top speed of 331.15mph (532.93km/h). When averaged with his 301.07mph (484.53km/h) run in the opposite direction, SSC North America set a new world speed record for production vehicles at 316.11mph (508.73km/h).</p>\n<p>Until now, the record for the world's fastest production car <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/bugatti-found-out-just-how-fast-the-chiron-is-flat-out-305mph/\">belonged to Bugatti</a>, which claimed it in 2019. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/this-is-what-its-like-driving-a-bugatti-chiron-at-305mph/\">Andy Wallace was behind the wheel</a> for that attempt, driving a 1,578hp (1,177kW) Bugatti Chiron Super Sport to top speed of 304.77mph (490.48km/h) at Volkswagen's massive test track in Ehra-Lessien, Germany. The SSC Tuatara packs even more power than the Chiron: 1,750hp (1,305kW) of power on E85, and it all gets sent to just the rear wheels, too. The Tuatara also has a more slippery shape, with a smaller frontal area than the Chiron (1.672m<sup>2</sup> vs 2.072m<sup>2</sup>) and a lower drag coefficient (0.279 vs 0.319).</p>\n<p>Those were conscious decisions during the Tuatara's design—SSC's founder Jerod Shelby has had his sights on the production speed record for some years now. \"My goal was always to beat this record by such a substantial amount that maybe it's going to stand in for a little while. I felt like that's what McLaren did back in the late nineties, and they held that record a long time because they just smashed the record. That was my dream in a perfect world,\" Shelby said.<!--adbreak--></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715641#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715641&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5TAERTbgLh4:pX9K_X7H-oA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=5TAERTbgLh4:pX9K_X7H-oA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5TAERTbgLh4:pX9K_X7H-oA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=5TAERTbgLh4:pX9K_X7H-oA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5TAERTbgLh4:pX9K_X7H-oA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5TAERTbgLh4:pX9K_X7H-oA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:00:50 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIPMAN_89354-980x653.jpg","linkMd5":"dcbd08854a214e31e1b95663fd390a1b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-14-527_eccc818555e7345a.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":653,"sourceBytes":117370,"destBytes":90342,"author":"Jonathan M.

And for those of us who've worked from home full-time in the past—well, at least for those of us who have done that and have loud families and kids with no concept of personal space—it has also become a lot harder to maintain a division between home life and work life. Our spouses and kids (and in some cases, adult kids) are all home at the same time, working or studying or playing or just <em>breathing too loudly</em> in the same space as us.</p>\n<h2>Meow mix</h2>\n<p>For those of you who've never enjoyed the solitude of a home office when everyone else is out of the house, trust me: what we have right now is <em>not</em> what working at home has been like for the past 25 years for me. To adjust to this, organizations must figure out how to keep teams cohesive in the absence of regular social contact. They also must find a balance between being <em>communicative</em> and being <em>intrusive</em> into the home life of employees, all while still keeping some kind of coherent work environment going so people can talk to each other and get work done.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715489#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715489&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DNBWq39aj2g:EwnT6HpERW4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DNBWq39aj2g:EwnT6HpERW4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DNBWq39aj2g:EwnT6HpERW4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DNBWq39aj2g:EwnT6HpERW4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DNBWq39aj2g:EwnT6HpERW4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DNBWq39aj2g:EwnT6HpERW4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 13:00:38 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/working-from-home-cat-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"2b56edc706abac55516e88c23d903552","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-06-873_b80a1a6cc6d2a61b.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":67254,"destBytes":30692,"author":"Sean Gallagher","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/working-from-home-cat-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-06-873_b80a1a6cc6d2a61b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DNBWq39aj2g:EwnT6HpERW4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-15-842_8780f2c171f2d651.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DNBWq39aj2g:EwnT6HpERW4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-15-968_a3ce022f1863168c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn80@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-15-700_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn33@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-16-086_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123138126},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:58","title":"A giant cat picture was just discovered among the Nazca Lines","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715622","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/catwhole-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"The cat is drawn from the side, with its head turned toward the viewer.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/catwhole.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1152\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The cat is drawn from the side, with its head turned toward the viewer.

A 6,000lb body-on-frame SUV is about as far from my automotive comfort zone as it's possible to get with a regular driver's license. And while there is a choice of gasoline V8 or turbodiesel inline-six, there's not a sniff of a hybrid option—not even the 48V mild kind, which feels inexcusable in the year 2020.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Cadillac has turned up the technology dial in an effort to regain its crown as the King of Bling. From the driver's seat you can see 38 inches of OLED screen wrapping around you. The highlight is an augmented reality mode that's cool enough to tempt you away from navigating by CarPlay or Android Auto and worthy of Ars' attention on its own.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2021-Cadillac-Escalade-2-980x745.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          This might be the Escalade's best angle.

It's where the domestic automakers make their money, and the new Escalade is built on General Motor's latest and greatest body-on-frame platform. And I do mean greatest. Our test vehicle was a $105,995 Escalade ESV 4WD Platinum, which stretches out across 226.9 inches (5,766mm), with a 134.1-inch (3.407mm) wheelbase. More than one neighbor remarked on how large it was as it jutted out of my parking space, which luckily is slightly wider than the Escalade's 81.1 inches (2,059mm). At 76.4 inches (1,942mm) tall, I was grateful for the retractable running boards that emerge when you open a door; if you're shorter than average, it is a $1,750 option you might want.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715567#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715567&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=RqVHHTmYrRs:HyUwtsubwJ8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=RqVHHTmYrRs:HyUwtsubwJ8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=RqVHHTmYrRs:HyUwtsubwJ8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=RqVHHTmYrRs:HyUwtsubwJ8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=RqVHHTmYrRs:HyUwtsubwJ8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=RqVHHTmYrRs:HyUwtsubwJ8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 12:00:13 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2021-Cadillac-Escalade-1-800x469.jpg","linkMd5":"a8e4318dec8fa3dd9346ac7e6c1cd79a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-58-58-660_251703a7d2def094.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":469,"sourceBytes":91049,"destBytes":49778,"author":"Jonathan M.

But there's a deeper reality here: SpaceX has made launching rockets almost seem routine. The company's vice president of reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, once told me that one of his goals was to take the \"magic\" out of rocket launches. And the company seems to be succeeding.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX is also succeeding at reuse. Sunday morning's launch used a Falcon 9 first stage that has already flown into space five times. This is the second time SpaceX has used a first stage a total of six times, and next year it is likely to reach ten uses of its rocket. And then there is the payload fairing. For the first time, SpaceX was able use each of these fairing halves for a third time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715634#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715634&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:21:07 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/50501515611_a29e04cb2e_k-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"f818c08a126b9632604ee1453e5bddc8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-58-58-790_07f9d54c2e7bb498.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":48733,"destBytes":33078,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/50501515611_a29e04cb2e_k-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-58-58-790_07f9d54c2e7bb498.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn75@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-15-778_f85fa6882d33f56e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn63@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-21-952_44f63a1eba45f804.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn80@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-15-700_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn33@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-16-086_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123138135}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:58:58","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:58:58 +0000","fetchMs":135,"handleMs":1068,"totalMs":40742,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"2fbc598270685d2ad3e3de972b0b4ef6","hostName":"us-021*","requestId":"17dfb391e5b1494bbacecb3f57eafbef_2","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":429554,"bgimgsTotal":6,"bgimgsGithubTotal":6,"articlesImgsTotal":21,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":21,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1,"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx7":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx32":1,"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx22":1,"myreaderx3":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx31":1,"myreaderx5oss":1,"myreaderx18":1,"myreaderx29":1,"myreaderx19":1,"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 13:47:33","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn62@2020_5/2020/09/05/05-47-27-309_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
