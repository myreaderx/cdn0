From juggling work priorities to managing distance learning for my kids, there never seems to be enough hours in the day. As we adapt, we’re relying on our phones to get things done.</p><p>How can brands lend a hand? We believe there are three key ways to put consumers at the core of your strategy: help people quickly get what they want, deliver relevant information and make it easy for your customers to take action.</p><p>Today, we’re sharing new ways to put your customers first and achieve your marketing objectives.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Help people get what they want, faster</h3><p>The stakes are high on mobile. If you don’t give people what they want quickly, they’ll take their business elsewhere. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/mobile-page-speed-data/\">we recently found</a> that for retail sites, improving your site load time by 0.1s can help you improve conversion rates by 8 percent.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/testmysite/\">Test My Site</a> has been an important tool for helping diagnose site speed and providing custom tips on how to make it faster. Today, we updated the tool to provide specific recommendations on how you can improve your mobile site—beyond speed—and deliver more personalized and seamless experiences. Key updates include:</p><ul><li><p>Aligning speed metrics with <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html\">Web Vitals</a>, an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that, we believe, are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web. When marketers and developers share the same definition of success, it’s easier to agree on what’s driving results.<br/></p></li><li><p>Customized tips on how to make your site experience relevant and easy to use.

With more product images directly in your ad, consumers are able to easily and seamlessly find what they’re shopping for. In the coming months, we’ll roll out feeds in App campaigns globally to all customers. According to beta testing, advertisers using feeds saw, on average, 6 percent more installs from Google.com and 17 percent more in-app actions (like log-ins and purchases) on sites and apps in our network.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Three phone mocks showing feeds in App campaigns\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/GML_blogpost_feeds_channels_final.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Surface relevant information about what your app offers</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Wish, an e-commerce company, used feeds to display diverse products from its marketplace.

For customers who already have your app installed, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9338589\">deep linking</a> lets them get to the relevant page in the app without having to log in or re-enter information. </p><p>Last year at Google Marketing Live, we announced app deep linking <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads/new-ad-innovations-new-consumer-journey/\">from Search, Display and Shopping ads</a>. In the coming months, we’ll be rolling out deep linking from YouTube, Hotel, Gmail and Discovery ads.
