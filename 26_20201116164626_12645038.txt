Its approach has mirrored that of a lot of other enterprise startups that spend a long time building their product under wraps. Identifying the market opportunity when it was still nascent, Harbr then worked directly (and quietly) with enterprises to figure out what they needed and build it, before launching it as a commercial product (with customers already in hand).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Back in 2017 no one was talking about enterprise data exchanges,&#8221; Harbr&#8217;s CSO Anthony Cosgrove (who co-founded the company with Gary Butler, the CEO) told me in an interview. &#8220;So we worked with big companies to understand their needs and built Harbr based on that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Customers include those in financial and enterprise services such as Moody&#8217;s Analytics and WinterCorp, as well as governments. Cosgrove noted that nearly 100% of Harbr&#8217;s clients are in the US, where the startup&#8217;s chairman Leo Spiegel is based. Spiegel is also an investor, with an extensive enterprise data services <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leospiegel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">resume to his name</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a team that has worked together for a long time,&#8221; Spiegel said in an interview. &#8220;Gary [the CEO] and I have worked together for 20 years before Harbr. I have been in data a very long time, and we have a lot of relationships with US companies.&#8221; (That is one sign of why this enterprise startup has raised a substantial amount of funding so early in its public life.)</p>\n<p>Cosgrove, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MBE</a>, himself has a background in banking and before that UK government.</p>\n<p>The platform today provides enterprises with a way to tap into data that an organization may already have in data lakes and warehouses, which it already uses for analytics and business intelligence. The idea is to make that data ready and secure for enterprise data exchange, either with other parts of your own large organization, or with third parties. The involves creating a &#8220;clean room&#8221;, providing tools for making it accessible by third parties, and potentially turning it into a data marketplace if that is your goal.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074160\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074160\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2074160\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png 1102w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png?resize=300,280 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png?resize=768,716 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png?resize=680,634 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074160\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Harbr</p></div></p>\n<p>The challenges that Harbr addresses come from a couple of different angles. The first of these is technical: putting data troves from disparate sources into a format that can be usable by others. The second of these is commercial: creating something that you can then provide to others, but also making that marketplace findable and usable. The third of these is security.</p>\n<p>Cosgrove said that he doesn&#8217;t think of Harbr as a security company first, but he points out that these days this has become as much of a concern (if not more) than simply making a data product usable. Being able to protect your data as valuable IP is important, but on top of that, you have the roles of privacy and data protection.</p>\n<p>These have moved from being fringe concerns to a priority for many users, and, in an increasing number of cases, a legal requirement. So, as companies look for ways to tap into the big data opportunity while keeping those principles in mind, they are looking for companies built with privacy and data protection from the ground up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re really focused on helping people to treat data as a product. They bring assets into a platform and turn them into data products that are easy to consume, use and merge,&#8221; said Cosgrove. &#8220;We see security as a by-product of that: you have to consider security as part of it.&#8221; Harbr the name is a play on Harbor, which itself is a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">safe harbor principles and regulations</a>.</p>\n<p>Harbr is not the only company looking at this opportunity. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/infosum-raises-15-1m-for-its-privacy-first-federated-approach-to-big-data-analytics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">InfoSum, also out of the UK</a>, is also tackling the concept of a privacy-first approach to federated data, providing a way to share data across organizations without compromising data protection in any way. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/datafleets-keeps-private-data-useful-and-useful-data-private-with-federated-learning-and-4-5m-seed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DataFleets out of the Bay Area</a> is also another startup also building a platform and tools to help enterprises with this challenge and opportunity.</p>\n<p>“For data to become truly powerful, we need more automation and collaboration. Today, human efforts are consumed by finding and preparing data, rather than focused on high-value activities that drive real productivity gains,” said Evgenia Plotnikova, partner at Dawn Capital, in a statement. “Harbr is in the vanguard of companies changing this reality, and we are incredibly excited to be partnering with them. Customers we’ve spoken to find Harbr&#8217;s enterprise data exchange transformative, and their engagement across Fortune 1000 companies substantiates this.”</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bBgQEZNpGsk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 11:00:15 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png?w=680","linkMd5":"f382f18709ad30c7c92c6c2b008803b1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn5@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-45-55-987_cebee491e5d723f1.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":634,"sourceBytes":37386,"destBytes":37386,"author":"Ingrid Lunden","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-16-at-10.35.44-AM.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn5@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-45-55-987_cebee491e5d723f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-45-59-494_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn95@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-18-673_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn92@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-09-031_1f446ecf929020ce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bBgQEZNpGsk:X2By8fD-3Cg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn29@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-46-09-038_e281a9815e38dcab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-04-648_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bBgQEZNpGsk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-46-04-593_4cebe38a0a103f83.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545155738},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","title":"HBO Max arrives on Amazon Fire TV devices","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074233","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/warnermedia\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"warnermedia\">WarnerMedia&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> streaming service <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/hbo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"hbo\">HBO <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Max is finally coming to Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV, nearly half a year after it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/amazon-hbo-max-fire-tv/\">first launched</a>. The service, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/hbo-max-launches-today-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">combines</a> HBO content with an expanded selection from WarnerMedia&#8217;s library and a slate of originals, debuted without support for two of the largest streaming platforms in the U.S.: Amazon Fire TV and Roku.</p>\n<p>As a part of the new deal, existing HBO subscribers on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> will be able to use the HBO Max app at no additional cost, along with anyone else who already has access to HBO Max.</p>\n<p>The delay to get the HBO Max app on Amazon Fire TV wasn&#8217;t technical in nature, but rather a result of failed negotiations between the companies. Amazon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/amazon-hbo-max-fire-tv/\">wanted to be able</a> to provide access to HBO Max through its existing Prime Video Channels platform, by making access to the expanded catalog available to existing HBO subscribers. This was complicated by the fact that HBO didn&#8217;t exactly release HBO Max as a brand-new service, but was updating its HBO Now app to become HBO Max. That seemingly left the door open for a similar upgrade to other existing HBO subscribers, Amazon believed.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>WarnerMedia, on the other hand, wanted to distribute HBO Max as a new streaming service, not as a premium channel add-on, like HBO. When asked about its failure to offer apps for Roku and Amazon Fire TV, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/amazon-hbo-max-fire-tv/\">explained in May</a> it was looking forward to &#8220;reaching agreements with the few outstanding distribution partners left, including with Amazon and on par with how they provide customers access to Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu on Fire devices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At last, that deal got done. The companies <a href=\"https://amazonfiretv.blog/hbo-max-is-coming-to-fire-tv-7f897c118652\">announced</a> this morning HBO Max would begin to roll out to Amazon Fire TV streaming devices, Fire TV Edition smart TVs, and Fire tablets on Tuesday, November 17. This will expand HBO Max&#8217;s potential reach to &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of Amazon device customers, WarnerMedia said.</p>\n<p>The company tells TechCrunch that, as a result of the deal, HBO content will continue to be available on Prime Video Channels with a subscription. Meanwhile, customers who have a subscription to HBO through Prime Video Channels now also have access to HBO Max for no additional cost.</p>\n<p>To access HBO Max, customers can log into the HBO Max app using their Amazon credentials, a spokesperson said. This is similar to how HBO customers can access the HBO Max app with other vMVPD (Virtual Multichannel Video Programming Distributor &#8212; a streaming service with live and on-demand content) credentials, like YouTube TV or Hulu.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very excited that Amazon customers will now be able to enjoy the best-in-class content that lives within HBO Max,&#8221; said Tony Goncalves, Head of Sales and Distribution for WarnerMedia, in a statement about the deal. &#8220;Our continued goal is to make HBO Max and its unparalleled content available to customers across all the devices they love. Fire TV is a favorite among customers and we look forward to working with the Amazon team to engage and grow our existing subscriber base by showcasing all that HBO Max has to offer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Fire TV integrations will also allow Amazon customers to launch and navigate HBO Max by voice, using Alexa commands like &#8220;Alexa, find HBO Max,&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, find Game of Thrones,&#8221; and more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve worked closely with HBO for many years to bring their great content to Fire TV and to make it easier to discover and enjoy with features like search integration, Alexa and personalized recommendations,: said Marc Whitten, Vice President of Amazon Entertainment Devices and Services, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to continue that partnership with the launch of HBO Max to bring even more incredible content to customers on Fire TV.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last month, WarnerMedia reported that HBO Max <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/hbo-max-hits-28-7m-subscribers-in-q3-but-few-are-over-the-top/\">had grown to reach 28.7 million total subscribers</a>, but few of these customers were &#8220;over the top&#8221; &#8212; meaning, coming in through standalone subscriptions to the HBO Max app, like what will be available on Amazon Fire TV. Instead, most customers were coming in from  <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hbo-max-over-30m-hbo-subscribers-have-yet-to-use-the-streaming-service/\">“wholesale” agreements</a> — that is, a pay TV provider of some kind. Only 3.6 million were considered direct retail subscribers.</p>\n<p>Those numbers may increase now that HBO Max is addressing at least one of the two key streaming device markets for distribution.

Storied private equity firm Hillhouse Capital led the round joined by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/trustbridge-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"trustbridge-partners\">Trustbridge Partners, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Pavilion Capital, and existing investors 5Y Capital (formerly Morningside) and Yunqi Partners.</p>\n<p>Investors are going after Zilliz as they increasingly recognize open source as an effective software development strategy, Charles Xie, founder and CEO of Zilliz, told TechCrunch at an open source meetup in Shenzhen where he spoke as the first Chinese board chairperson for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/linux-foundation\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"linux-foundation\">Linux Foundation&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> AI umbrella,<a href=\"https://lfaidata.foundation/people/governing-board/\"> LF AI</a>.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;Investors are seeing very good exits for open source companies around the world in recent years, from Elastic to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/mongodb-inc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mongodb-inc\">MongoDB,&#8221; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> he added.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"m4iasJxul9\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/\">How open-source software took over the world</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;How open-source software took over the world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/embed/#?secret=m4iasJxul9\" data-secret=\"m4iasJxul9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;When Starlord [Xie&#8217;s nickname] first told us his vision for data processing in the future digital age, we thought it was a crazy idea, but we chose to believe,&#8221; said 5Y Capital&#8217;s partner Liu Kai.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one caveat for investing in the area: don&#8217;t expect to make money in the first 3 to 5 years. &#8220;But if you&#8217;re looking at an 8 to 10-year cycle, these [open source] companies can gain valuation at tens of billions of dollars,&#8221; Xie reckoned.</p>\n<p>After six years as a software engineer at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oracle\">Oracle, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Xie left the U.S. and headed home to start Zilliz in China. Like many Chinese entrepreneurs these days, Xie named his startup in English to mark the firm&#8217;s vision to be &#8220;global from day one.&#8221; While Zilliz set out in Shanghai, the goal is to relocate its headquarters to Silicon Valley when the firm delivers &#8220;robust technology and products&#8221; in the next 12 months, Xie said. China is an ideal starting point both for the cheaper engineering talents and the explosive growth of unstructured data &#8212; anything from molecular structure, people&#8217;s shopping behavior, audio information to video content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The amount of unstructured data in a region is in proportion to the size of its population and the level of its economic activity, so it&#8217;s easy to see why China is the biggest data source,&#8221; Xie observed.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, China has seen rapid development in mobile internet and AI, especially in terms of real-life applications, which Xie argued makes China a suitable testing ground for data processing software.</p>\n<p>So far Zilliz&#8217;s open source product <a href=\"https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus\">Milvus</a> has been &#8220;starred&#8221; over 4,440 times on GitHub and attracted some 120 contributors and 400 enterprise users around the world, half of whom are outside China. It&#8217;s done so without spending a penny on advertising; rather, user acquisition has come from its active participation on GitHub, Reddit, and other online developer communities.</p>\n<p>Going forward, Zilliz plans to deploy its fresh capital in overseas recruitment, expanding its open source ecosystem, as well as research and development in its cloud-based products and services, which will eventually become a revenue driver as it starts monetizing in the second half of 2021.</p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yAI91VE1bPg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 14:16:13 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"7cb87d9b3dd34905c956d880e657c7e5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Rita Liao","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-45-59-494_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn95@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-18-673_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-46-00-678_31a2c03c7b1014d1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yAI91VE1bPg:xqITXA5rY2E:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-45-58-581_bf273edf6710c1a3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-04-648_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yAI91VE1bPg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn31@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-45-58-467_1c0668e3466dbcf4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545155738},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","title":"Zeotap raises $18.5M for a customer ID platform it says was built with privacy in mind","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074167","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As the online world slowly moves to a more privacy-focused environment free of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cookies</a>, startups building alternative ways to help businesses manage customer identity and build marketing around that are getting attention. <a href=\"http://zeotap.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zeotap</a>, a customer identity platform built around a company&#8217;s own (first-party) data that combines this with other data sources to create more complete pictures of users and what they do, is today announcing that it has raised a further $18.5 million.</p>\n<p>This is an extension of a Series C round for the firm coming from a single investor, SignalFire, from its Breakout Fund, reserved for growth-stage investments.

And those that are</span> more resilient and seeing the current time as an opportunity to scale. Whichever category you fall in, customer data is important.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company is currently active in 14 markets, he said, with products aimed at publishers, brands, and data partners. Zeotap&#8217;s platform essentially covers a few key areas. First, a customer data platform based around an organization&#8217;s first party data about its own customers, which provides a unified customer view for an organization based on what it already has. &#8220;This is much harder to do than you&#8217;d expect,&#8221; Banerjea said. &#8220;Managing consent is top of mind here, while making the most of first-party assets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Second comes ID resolution. Zeotap claims that it hosts the largest marketing identity graph in the world, with a &#8220;network of identifiers that can locate a customer across different channels.&#8221; This can include offline phone numbers, email and home addresses, alongside browsing activity. &#8220;We can provide a bridge to the digital world for offline names,&#8221; he said, adding that Zeotap works with some 112 providers to pool data into a single, unified customer view.</p>\n<p>These then come together in Zeotap&#8217;s universal ID+ product, which he said is &#8220;fully consent based and tokenized, with no data leakage.&#8221; This essentially is sold to clients whose marketers can then help their efforts &#8220;transit across the ecosystem without any exposure for the customer but also for any of our partners.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A lot of the regulations that have emerged, and the reasons cookies are being depreciated, are to provide better protection for consumers, to give them better transparency around how and where their data is being used.

I am glad you asked, because those were precisely the questions that I had going into its filing.</p>\n<p>Pull up the document <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020016443/c3ais-1.htm\">here</a>, and let&#8217;s get into the numbers.</p>\n<h2>Inside the guts of a modern AI company</h2>\n<p>First, what is C3? The former startup calls itself an enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) company, selling software services that help big companies build AI apps &#8220;of extraordinary scale and complexity that offer significant social and economic benefit,&#8221; according to its S-1.</p>\n<p>The company sells its software in two forms: as a developer environment that lets customers design, build and deploy their AI apps on their cloud of choice, and as a group of pre-built apps users can spin up quickly. If C3 were a startup, I&#8217;d ask at this point how efficacious its AI tooling really is, but as this unicorn is worth $3.3 billion and has nine-figure revenue, it must have come up with something that works.</p>\n<p>A host of venture capital firms have invested in C3, with the company raising more than $360 million during its lifetime, <a href=\"http://pitchbook.com\">according to PitchBook data.</a> BlackRock led its Series H, FS Investors led its Series G, its $100 million Series F was led by TPG, Breyer Capital led its Series E, TPG Growth led its Series D, while its Series C and before are a little harder to parse, but it appears that Makena Capital Management and Interwest Partners were active at that stage.</p>\n<p>Looking to ownership, founder and entrepreneur Thomas Siebel owns just under 34%, TPG owns 22.6%, and Baker Hughes owns around 15%. The company&#8217;s voting power rests in its Class B stock, which Siebel effectively controls.</p>\n<p>Right now, is the business itself any damn good?</p>\n<h3>The numbers</h3>\n<p>C3 has an annoying fiscal year, a twelve-month period that ends on April 30th. So, when we discuss its most recent two fiscal years, we&#8217;re chatting about the four-quarter periods that ended onm April 30, 2019 and April 30, 2020. Afterwards, we&#8217;ll drill into the July 31 quarter, the most recent period for which we have data.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

general partner at <a href=\"http://www.humbition.com/\">humbition</a>.\t</div>\n\t\n\t</div>\n</div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">This month, the Securities Exchange Commission approved major updates to rules enacted via the 2012 JOBS Act. Their stated goal was to &#8220;harmonize&#8221; the guidelines that establish exemptions for equity crowdfunding, Reg D and Reg A+ offerings. These changes are a powerful step forward for both startups and investors alike.</p>\n<p>This is a space I’ve watched closely since we launched<a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/\"> Indiegogo</a> in 2008 and<a href=\"https://www.withvincent.com/\"> Vincent</a> earlier this year. I spent four years working with the Obama administration, the SEC and FINRA to help pass the<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/jobs-act.shtml\"> JOBS Act</a> in 2012. After that, it took another four years of rule refining with the SEC and FINRA before finally seeing equity crowdfunding go live in May 2016. At Indiegogo, we worked with several great partners, helping fund nearly 150 businesses via equity crowdfunding in just a couple of years.</p>\n<p>For those who worked behind the scenes, we knew that the initial 2016 rules for equity crowdfunding were baby steps. We were balancing unknown risks with legacy rules, aiming toward broader democratization for both investors and entrepreneurs. Now, crowdfunding’s day has come, and I commend all involved including the regulators, politicians, startups and investors who all worked together to push the ecosystem forward to the next step.</p>\n<p>That said, even today equity crowdfunding isn’t perfect. There are limits to how much you can raise, how you can communicate and how much documentation you need to provide. In reality, it’s not much different than raising from a pre-seed or seed investor, or far removed from a traditional product crowdfund. In short, it works.</p>\n<p>The SEC made some important changes to the rules, and it’s valuable to explore them one by one. Rather than look at them on a macro scale, here are some of the bullet points that are important to entrepreneurs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regulation Crowdfunding</strong> (Reg CF) is the basic equity crowdfunding raise for companies. Now, companies can raise up to $5 million from investors, up from the current $1.07 million cap. Any investor can participate.</li>\n<li><strong>Regulation D, Rule 504 </strong>(Reg D) is another type of equity crowdfunding, but exclusively for accredited investors. With the new rules, its maximum funding cap raises to $10 million from $5 million.</li>\n<li><strong>Regulation A+, Tier II </strong>(Reg A+), which is for more established companies, can now raise $75 million via equity crowdfunding, up from the current $50 million. This is a huge move, enabling established companies to gain millions of dry powder. Any investor can participate.</li>\n<li>Thanks to a <strong>&#8220;test the waters&#8221;</strong> provision, companies can build Indiegogo-like crowdfunding pages that allow companies to share information with investors prior to fundraising. This is new for Reg CF, but was previously allowed for Reg A+.</li>\n<li><strong>Demo day communications</strong>, in general, will no longer be considered general solicitation.</li>\n<li>Reg CF and A+ offerings can use <strong>special purpose vehicles</strong> (SPVs) to consolidate their investor base into a single line item on a cap table.</li>\n<li>Reg CF fundraisers can be done every <strong>30 days</strong>, down from every 180 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now for a report card. In hopes of clarifying these changes a bit, I looked at each specific point and gave it a letter grade depending on how important it will be to up-and-coming entrepreneurs. While many of the rules got an A or better, some are still lagging and, as we move into a new administration and new year, the difference between crowdfunding success and failure could be spelled out in these simple changes.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) limit increase</strong></h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Grade</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Previous rules (2016)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Updated rules (2020)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>A</strong></td>\n<td>Maximum allowed fundraise of $1.07 million</td>\n<td>Increase in maximum fundraise to $5 million</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This change is significant. One of the main complaints we heard from entrepreneurs exploring Reg CF were the actual costs associated with the raise. Between financial, legal and platform fees, companies could be looking at setup costs of $100,000 or more. Combined with time, effort and additional marketing expenses, it adds up to a lot of money just to be capped at $1 million. When compared to finding a few angel investors, the costs often don’t justify the effort. But at a $5 million cap, the cost-of-capital economics drastically improve. Also $5 million is real money, not something a few angels can match.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Regulation A+ Tier II limit increase</strong></h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Grade</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Previous rules (2016)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Updated rules (2020)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>C</strong></td>\n<td>Maximum allowed fundraise of $50 million</td>\n<td>Increase in maximum fundraise to $75 million</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In this case, it’s nice that the cap has gone up, but this isn’t a game-changer. Rarely do Reg A+ offerings even hit the $50 million cap, and those considering Reg+ rarely cite the cap as a key deciding factor. It’s always nice to see the number go up, but this doesn’t change much.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/qPpZcQxIWSA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 15:00:15 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"a0cde393ef291b11011eb8f3ee19ec24","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-45-59-494_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn95@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-18-673_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn43@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-45-58-694_0da38f2f7538e969.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=qPpZcQxIWSA:Z-axEv24uS0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn64@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-58-665_139d3c3809582db0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-04-648_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/qPpZcQxIWSA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn25@2020_5/2020/11/16/16-45-59-634_501766023ef2af3a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545155729},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","title":"‘Resident Evil’ game maker Capcom confirms data breach after ransomware attack","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074253","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/capcom\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"capcom\">Capcom, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> the Japanese game maker behind the <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em> franchises, has confirmed that hackers stole customer data and files from its internal network following a ransomware attack earlier in the month.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s an about-turn from the days immediately following the cyberattack, in which Capcom said it had <a href=\"http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e201104.html?=03112020\">no evidence</a> that customer data had been accessed.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e201116.html?=15112020\">a statement</a>, the company said data on as many as 350,000 customers may have been stolen, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and in some cases dates of birth. Capcom said the hackers also stole its own internal financial data and human resources files on current and former employees, which included names, addresses, dates of birth, and photos. The attackers also took &#8220;confidential corporate information,&#8221; the company said, including documents on business partners, sales, and development.</p>\n<p>Capcom said that no credit card information was taken, as payments are handled by a third-party company.</p>\n<p>But the company warned that the overall amount of data stolen &#8220;cannot specifically be ascertained&#8221; due to losing its own internal logs in the cyberattack.</p>\n<p>Capcom apologized for the breach. &#8220;Capcom offers its sincerest apologies for any complications and concerns that this may bring to its potentially impacted customers as well as to its many stakeholders,&#8221; the statement read.</p>\n<p>The video games maker was hit by the Ragnar Locker ransomware on November 2, prompting the company to shut down its network.

In doing so, ransomware groups can still demand a company pays the ransom even if the victim restores their files and systems from backups.</p>\n<p>Ragnar Locker&#8217;s website now lists data allegedly stolen from Capcom, with a message implying that the company did not pay the ransom.</p>\n<p>Capcom said it had informed data protection regulators in Japan and the United Kingdom, as required under European GDPR data breach notification rules.

The biotech company <a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy\">says that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate</a> has shown efficacy of 94.5% in its first interim data analysis, which covers 95 confirmed COVID cases among its study participants, of which 90 were given the placebo, and only 5 received Moderna&#8217;s mRNA-based vaccine. Further, of 11 severe cases of COVID-19, none were found among those who received the actual vaccine candidate.</p>\n<p>This is another very promising sign for the potential of having effective vaccines available to the public in some kind of significant volume at some point next year. As mentioned, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that this is just a first interim report, but it is data that comes from the safety board overseeing the trial appointed by the National Institutes of Health, which is an independent body not affiliated with Moderna, so it&#8217;s a reliable result that provides hope for continued and final analysis.</p>\n<p>Moderna says that it will be submitting for an Emergency Use Authorization of its vaccine candidate based on the results within the coming weeks, looking to get approval from the FDA to use it in emergency circumstances ahead of a full and final approval. That EUA, should it be granted, will be based on data from 151 confirmed cases among the Phase 3 participant group (which included 30,000 participants in total), and data from follow-ups extending on average over two months after case confirmation.</p>\n<p>All final data will also be submitted to the scientific community for independent peer review, which is a standard part of the ultimate vaccine trial and approval process.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"SDVNR3FeMc\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-proves-90-effective-in-first-results-from-phase-3-clinical-trial/\">Pfizer&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine proves 90% effective in first results from Phase 3 clinical trial</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine proves 90% effective in first results from Phase 3 clinical trial&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-proves-90-effective-in-first-results-from-phase-3-clinical-trial/embed/#?secret=SDVNR3FeMc\" data-secret=\"SDVNR3FeMc\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Both these and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/pfizer\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"pfizer\">Pfizer&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> vaccine candidate, which it developed in partnership with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/biontech-ag\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"biontech-ag\">BioNTech, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> are mRNA-based vaccines.

As a result, enrollment is down across the country and university business models are under unrelenting pressure.</p>\n<p>The entire athletics program at East Carolina University has been furloughed with pay cuts. Ohio Wesleyan University eliminated 18 majors and consolidated a number of programs to save $4 million a year. And Pennsylvania&#8217;s Kutztown University lost 1,000 students to online school within weeks of reopening its campus, sacrificing $3.5 million in room and board fees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/higher-ed\">And that’s just in the last few weeks.</a></p>\n<p>As universities struggle, edtech is being positioned as a solution for their largest problem: remote teaching. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/coursera\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coursera\">Coursera, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> a massive open online course (MOOC), created a campus product to help schools quickly offer digital coursework. Podium Education raised millions last month to offer universities for-credit tech programs. Eruditus brought on more than $100 million in the last few months to create programming for elite universities. In some ways, the growth is the story of edtech’s ongoing surge amid the coronavirus pandemic: Remote schooling has forced institutions to piece together third-party solutions to keep operations afloat.</p>\n<p>However, while some startups are helping universities offer virtual programming overnight, professors on the ground are warning their institutions to think long-term about what kind of technologies are net positive to adopt.</p>\n<p>It’s a stress test that could lead to a reckoning among edtech startups.</p>\n<h2>&#8216;We&#8217;re talking about the next evolution of textbooks&#8217;</h2>\n<p>As the last eight months have taught us, Zoom-based school is a lackluster alternative to the in-person experience. College campuses, thus, are tasked with finding a more creative way to offer engaging virtual content to students who are stuck in their dorm rooms.</p>\n<p>Coursera launched Coursera for Campus to help colleges bring on online courses (credit optional) with built-in exams; more than 3,700 schools across the world are using the software.</p>\n<p>“Professors would really want super-high-quality branded content that has assessments built into it if they&#8217;re going to deliver that learning for credit,” CEO Jeff Maggioncalda said. “That&#8217;s not the kind of learning you can get on YouTube.”</p>\n<p>For now, though, Maggioncalda says he doesn’t think the death of a physical college campus experience is the future. He’s betting that the product can help colleges save money on faculty costs and reinvest that same money into the campus.</p>\n<p>“There will be schools that will continue to offer residential experience, and I think what they&#8217;re gonna find is, if your real value proposition is that residential experience, then lead into that heavily,” he said. “But make sure that you&#8217;ve got really good content and credentials that are available so that your students don&#8217;t have to sacrifice.”</p>\n<p>Georgia Tech professor David Joyner says that MOOCs like Coursera &#8220;are good for outreach and access, but are not good for accreditation.” Instead, he thinks edtech needs to be built first and foremost for universities to be most effective.</p>\n<p>Podium Education, for example, builds courses in partnership with universities to offer for-credit courses.

making no further comment at this stage.</p>\n<p>While Apple isn&#8217;t the typical target for digital privacy campaigners, given it makes most of its money selling hardware and software instead of profiling users for ad targeting, as adtech giants like Facebook and Google do, its marketing rhetoric around taking special care over user privacy can look awkward when set against the existence of an Identifier for Advertisers baked into its hardware.</p>\n<p>In the European Union there&#8217;s a specific legal dimension to this awkwardness &#8212; as existing laws require explicit consent from users to (non-essential) tracking. noyb&#8217;s complaints cite Article 5(3) of the EU&#8217;s ePrivacy Directive which mandates that users must be asked for consent to the storage of ad tracking technologies such as cookies. (And noyb argues the IDFA is just like a tracking cookie but for iPhones.)</p>\n<p>Europe&#8217;s top court further strengthened the requirement <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/\">last year</a> when it made it clear that consent for non-essential tracking must be obtained prior to storing or accessing the trackers.

Tracking is only allowed if users explicitly consent to it. This very simple rule applies regardless of the tracking technology used. While Apple introduced functions in their browser to block cookies, it places similar codes in its phones, without any consent by the user. This is a clear breach of EU privacy laws.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Apple has long controlled how third parties serving apps on its iOS platform can use the IDFA, wielding the stick of ejection from its App Store to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/11/apple-developers-must-now-agree-to-ad-identifier-rules-or-risk-app-store-rejection/\">drive their compliance with its rules</a>.</p>\n<p>Recently, though, it has gone further &#8212; telling advertisers this summer they <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/\">will soon have to offer users an opt-out from ad tracking</a> in a move billed as increasing privacy controls for iOS users &#8212; although Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/\">delayed implementation of the policy</a> until early next year after facing anger from advertisers over the plan. But the idea is there will be a toggle in iOS 14 that users need to flip on before a third party app gets to access the IDFA to track iPhone users&#8217; in-app activity for ad targeting.</p>\n<p>However noyb&#8217;s complaint focuses on Apple&#8217;s setting of the IDFA in the first place &#8212; arguing that since the pseudonymised identifier constitutes private (personal) data under EU law they need to get permission before creating and storing it on their device.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The IDFA is like a &#8216;digital license plate&#8217;. Every action of the user can be linked to the &#8216;license plate&#8217; and used to build a rich profile about the user. Such profile can later be used to target personalised advertisements, in-app purchases, promotions etc. When compared to traditional internet tracking IDs, the IDFA is simply a &#8216;tracking ID in a mobile phone&#8217; instead of a tracking ID in a browser cookie,&#8221; noyb writes in one complaint, noting that Apple&#8217;s privacy policy does not specify the legal basis it uses to &#8220;place and process&#8221; the IDFA.</p>\n<p>noyb also argues that Apple&#8217;s planned changes to how the IDFA gets accessed &#8212; trailed as incoming in early 2021 &#8212; don&#8217;t go far enough.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These changes seem to restrict the use of the IDFA for third parties (but not for Apple itself),&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Just like when an app requests access to the camera or microphone, the plans foresee a new dialog that asks the user if an app should be able to access the IDFA. However, the initial storage of the IDFA and Apple’s use of it will still be done without the users’ consent and therefore in breach of EU law. It is unclear when and if these changes will be implemented by the company.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We reached out to Apple for comment on noyb&#8217;s complaints but at the time of writing an Apple spokesman said it did not have an on-the-record statement. The spokesman did tell us that Apple itself does not use unique customer identifiers for advertising. <strong>Update: </strong>The company has now sent us this statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The claims made against Apple in this complaint are factually inaccurate and we look forward to making that clear to privacy regulators should they examine the complaint. Apple does not access or use the IDFA on a user’s device for any purpose. Our aim is always to protect the privacy of our users and our latest software release, iOS 14, is giving users even greater control over whether or not they want to allow apps to track them by linking their information with data from third parties for the purpose of advertising, or sharing their information with data brokers. Our practices comply with European law and support and advance the aims of the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive, which is to give people full control over their data.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a separate but related recent development, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-advertisting-france-idUSL1N2HJ237\">last month</a> publishers and advertisers in France filed an antitrust complaint against the iPhone maker over its plan to require opt-in consent for accessing the IDFA &#8212; with the coalition contending the move amounts to an abuse of market power.</p>\n<p>Apple responded to the antitrust complaint in a statement that said: &#8220;With iOS 14, we’re giving users the choice whether or not they want to allow apps to track them by linking their information with data from third parties for the purpose of advertising, or sharing their information with data brokers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">We believe privacy is a fundamental human right and support the European Union’s leadership in protecting privacy with strong laws such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation),&#8221; Apple added then.</span></p>\n<p>That antitrust complaint may explain why noyb has decided to file its own strategic complaints against Apple&#8217;s IDFA. Simply put, if no tracker ID can be created &#8212; because an iOS user refuses to give consent &#8212; there&#8217;s less surface area for advertisers to try to litigate against privacy by claiming tracking is a competitive right.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that Apple violated the law before, now and after these changes,&#8221; said Rossetti in another statement. &#8220;With our complaints we want to enforce a simple principle: trackers are illegal, unless a user freely consents. The IDFA should not only be restricted, but permanently deleted. Smartphones are the most intimate device for most people and they must be tracker-free by default.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another interesting component of the noyb complaints is they&#8217;re being filed under the ePrivacy Directive, rather than under Europe&#8217;s (newer) General Data Protection Regulation. This means noyb is able to target them to specific EU data protection agencies, rather than having complaints funnelled back to Ireland&#8217;s DPC &#8212; under the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism for handling cross-border cases.</p>\n<p>Its hope is this route will result in swifter regulatory action. <em>&#8220;</em>These cases are based on the &#8216;old&#8217; cookie law and do not trigger the cooperation mechanism of the GDPR. In other words, we are trying to avoid endless procedures like the ones we are facing in Ireland,&#8221; added Rossetti.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iScaHdZBXW\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/\">Lack of big tech GDPR decisions looms large in EU watchdog&#8217;s annual report</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Lack of big tech GDPR decisions looms large in EU watchdog&#8217;s annual report&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/embed/#?secret=iScaHdZBXW\" data-secret=\"iScaHdZBXW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/l88mULzCfbE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:02:38 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"0f4cfe391be95ee5119cc02613ae6101","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Lomas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-45-59-494_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn95@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-18-673_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn28@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-01-579_45ef94baf4c0e317.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l88mULzCfbE:QRoLmwjIn2Y:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-45-58-586_0025c70f984feae9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-04-648_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/l88mULzCfbE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn28@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-58-476_01f8feb8c0eef591.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545155735},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","title":"A court decision in favor of startup UpCodes may help shape open access to the law","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2072938","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">For the past three years, <a href=\"https://up.codes/\">UpCodes</a> and its founders have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/can-the-law-be-copyrighted/\">been entangled in a copyright lawsuit</a> filed by the International Code Council (ICC). Though both focus on the building industry (specifically, the codes architects and builders need to follow), the lawsuit deals with an issue that has wider ramifications: is it possible to copyright the law, or text that carries the weight of the law?</p>\n<p>Founded in 2016 and backed by investors including Y Combinator, UpCodes offers two main products, a database of state building codes that is available on a freemium basis, and UpCodes AI, which scans 3D building models for potential code violations. UpCodes&#8217; building code database is at the center of the lawsuit, because it contains material the ICC claims copyright on. UpCodes says its software simplifies the complex and <a href=\"https://accounts.wsj.com/login?target=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fhome-builders-say-they-are-squeezed-by-rising-compliance-costs-1462613401\">often expensive process</a> of code compliance, one of the most important parts of the building process. But the ICC, the nonprofit organization that develops the model code used or adopted for building regulations by all 50 states, claims UpCodes impacts its ability <a href=\"https://www.iccsafe.org/about/periodicals-and-newsroom/icc-pulse/message-from-the-code-council-chief-executive-officer/\">to make revenue and continue authoring new code</a>.</p>\n<p>In May, UpCodes won a major decision in the case when United States District Judge Victor Marrero ruled that its posting of building codes was covered by public domain and fair use (a copy of Marrero&#8217;s ruling is embedded below).</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The lawsuit will proceed because both parties’ motions for dismissal were not granted, but Scott Reynolds, who founded UpCodes with his brother Garrett, called the ruling &#8220;a huge advance for us in terms of what we’re doing and making sure UpCodes continues in the future.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MSSxRCBiYx\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/can-the-law-be-copyrighted/\">Can the law be copyrighted?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Can the law be copyrighted?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/can-the-law-be-copyrighted/embed/#?secret=MSSxRCBiYx\" data-secret=\"MSSxRCBiYx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Nine days after Judge Marrero’s ruling on May 27, however, the ICC filed another lawsuit against UpCodes and the Reynolds brothers. This time, the ICC is suing UpCodes for false advertising and unfair competition, claiming that the startup&#8217;s copies of building codes are &#8220;incomplete and riddled with errors.&#8221; UpCodes maintains that the second lawsuit is an attempt to find another way to shut down its business.</p>\n<h3>The ruling&#8217;s wider implications</h3>\n<p>Marrero’s decision in the first lawsuit is noteworthy because it is one of the first to cite the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-1150_7m58.pdf\">Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year in Georgia v. Public.Resource.org</a>, which stemmed from another case involving copyright and the law.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the State of Georgia’s Code Revision Committee sued Public.Resource.org, a non-profit that shares public domain materials, to stop it from publishing the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (OCGA), a compilation of all laws in the state. The Code Revision Committee argued that annotations made to the OCGA placed it under state copyright, but the Supreme Court<a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/georgia-loses-legal-code-copyright-clash-at-supreme-court\"> ultimately ruled in April</a> that Georgia does not have copyright over the annotated legal code.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court ruling was watched closely by building professionals and open access advocates. As <a href=\"https://www.archpaper.com/2020/10/recent-court-decisions-on-the-business-of-building-codes-are-a-boon-for-open-access-advocates/\">Architect’s Newspaper</a> wrote in an article published last month, “the Georgia precedent helps clarify the border between private property and the public domain, with implications for architects using or considering such products as well as advocates of nonmonetized availability of code information.”</p>\n<p>In an email to TechCrunch, lawyer Joseph Gratz, who represents UpCodes and the Reynolds brothers, said the UpCodes lawsuit&#8217;s relevancy extends beyond the building industry because &#8220;obviously, it deals with a key question about how we govern ourselves as a society. The ruling confirms that the law belongs to the people, and nobody owns it. You can’t make a business model out of owning the legal rules that citizens have to follow; you have to find some other way to support your business which ICC has done, by getting revenue from program services.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He added, &#8220;It’s a model of how open government data can drive new innovations and successful startups. Law isn’t the only kind of information created by the government that can be leveraged in new ways. Property data, statistics and other kinds of government data can also support new businesses. And in all those cases, big old incumbents like ICC will try to find ways to slow down their new competitors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>UpCodes was founded by Scott, an architect, and Garrett, a software engineer who previously worked at PlanGrid. The brothers wanted to create a more efficient way to reference building codes, which are so complex that many architecture and building firms hire code consultants to help them navigate regulations. Headquartered in San Francisco, the company currently has about 400,000 monthly active users, mostly industry professionals like architects and engineers, but also home owners and rental tenants.</p>\n<p>ICC’s first lawsuit against UpCodes claims the startup violated its copyright on forty <a href=\"https://www.iccsafe.org/products-and-services/i-codes/the-i-codes/\">International Codes (I-Codes)</a>, the set of model building codes that have been adopted by all 50 states. The ICC argues that this impedes their ability to generate revenue from selling copies of its model codes, therefore making it harder for the organization to develop new building codes.</p>\n<p>But UpCodes’ stance, supported by Marrero’s ruling, is that the I-Codes are either in the public domain or protected by fair use because they have been adopted into law by federal, state and local governments. (After the ICC filed its copyright infringement lawsuit in August 2017, UpCodes’ site was redesigned to include only enacted state and local building codes, instead of the ICC’s model codes).</p>\n<h3>Does the government edicts doctrine apply?</h3>\n<p>Despite being opponents in two ongoing lawsuits now, both UpCodes and the ICC view the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling in Georgia v. Public.Resource.org positively.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What was really interesting for our case is that no matter if they were in the majority or dissenting, Supreme Court justices on both sides had really incredible quotes that said if it is in the law, of course it’s in the public domain,&#8221; said Scott Reynolds.</p>\n<p>ICC’s general counsel Melike Oncu, however, said that the ruling &#8220;confirmed that [the ICC] is the owner of the model codes it publishes&#8221; because of what it said about the governments edicts doctrine. As <a href=\"https://law.resource.org/pub/edicts.html\">defined by the U.S. Copyright Office</a>, the doctrine states &#8220;edicts of government, such as judicial opinions, administrative rulings, legislative enactments, public ordinances, and similar official legal documents are not copyrightable for reasons of public policy. This applies to such works whether they are Federal, State, or local as well as to those of foreign governments.”</p>\n<p>Oncu told TechCrunch in an email that the Supreme Court &#8220;confirmed that the government edicts doctrine is &#8216;a straightforward rule based on the identity of the author… assessed by asking &#8216;whether the author of the work is a judge or legislator&#8217; acting in &#8216;the course of his judicial or legislative duties and <em>not</em> &#8216;whether given material carries &#8216;the force of law.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other words, Oncu said &#8220;this means that the government edicts doctrine does not apply to the Code Council’s I-Codes and that they retain copyright protection regardless of whether or not they are later adopted into law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In his decision, Marrero wrote that &#8220;because ICC is a private party that lacks the authority to make or interpret the law, the Government Edicts doctrine is clearly not dispositive of this case.&#8221; But he also noted that ICC encourages adoption of its model codes into law, so that &#8220;even if adoption into law is not the sole reason ICC produces the I-Codes, it is clearly one of the most significant reasons, if not the most significant reason, that the ICC does so,&#8221; and that &#8220;a private party cannot exercise its copyrights to restrict the public’s access to the law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The ICC disagrees with Marrero’s ruling, Oncu told TechCrunch. The organization &#8220;believes that his decision was wrong because it held that codes that have the force of law are not copyrightable even if they are authored by a private party. As such, the decision is directly contradicted by the Supreme Court decision’s in Georgia.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Gratz said that &#8220;building codes are the law, and the Supreme Court ruled that &#8216;no one can own the law.&#8217; That’s exactly what Judge Marrero ruled.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gratz added that &#8220;even if the government edicts doctrine doesn’t apply, UpCodes wins for two other separate reasons: because there’s only one way to express the law accurately, so UpCodes had to express it the same way ICC wrote it; and because UpCodes was using the material solely for the purpose of informing the public about what the law is, which the court has found to be fair use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In his decision, Marrero cited two other previous rulings involving two of the three groups that <a href=\"https://www.iccsafe.org/about/who-we-are/0\">merged to form the ICC in 1994</a>: the Building Officials and Code Administration (BOCA) and the Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI).</p>\n<p>In 1980, BOCA sued private publisher Code Technology for publishing and selling its own edition of building code that was adopted by Massachusetts. The First Circuit court ruled in Code Technology’s favor. Then in 2002, the SBCCI sued Peter Veeck for posting a model building code adopted by local governments on his website, which gave free information about North Texas. SBCCI initially won the case in district court, but lost the appeal when the Fifth Circuit ruled in Veeck’s favor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Though the Government Edicts doctrine does not address government adoption of model building codes, two circuit courts have considered the issue,&#8221; Marrero wrote. &#8220;Their holdings are broadly consistent with each other and reaffirm the principle that no one can own the law. Moreever, both cases concern the model codes of ICC’s predecessors, SBCCI and BOCA, on which at least some of the I-Codes are based. These cases strongly suggest that Defendants do not infringe ICC’s copyrights insofar as they accurately post the I-Codes as adopted.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The second lawsuit</h3>\n<p>After Marerro’s ruling, the Reynolds brother said they thought ICC might want to reach a settlement to avoid the chance of setting another precedent in Circuit Court. Instead, the ICC filed its second lawsuit on June 5, claiming that UpCodes and the Reynolds brothers &#8220;falsely have claimed and still claim that the copies of the codes they offer are, e.g. accurate, completed and up-to-date.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the suit, ICC cites a section in Marrero’s ruling where the judge explained why he was denying UpCodes’ motion for dismissal. &#8220;ICC has still raised genuine factual disputes that at least some of the codes posted on Current UpCodes [referring to the version of the site after the initial lawsuit was filed] have &#8216;indiscriminately mingled&#8217; enacted text with unadopted model text.&#8221;</p>\n<p>UpCodes corrected the errors when notified by the ICC. The Reynolds brothers said that the second lawsuit pointed out less than two dozen errors on UpCodes’ site, but they have now documented more than 400 sections on ICC’s site that either have an error or out-of-date code that they will use in their response.</p>\n<p>Gratz said, &#8220;ICC appears to have filed the second lawsuit as a back-up plan to misuse unfair competition law to shut down a superior competitor, since ICC’s first attempt to shut down UpCodes failed. Instead of competing in the marketplace, ICC is wasting time with litigation over marketing copy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both ICC and UpCodes told TechCrunch that they collaborate closely with jurisdictions to make sure codes are up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Oncu said that ICC &#8220;works hand-in-hand with jurisdictions to publish custom codes. The Code Council receives approval from government officials from each jurisdiction that the code it posts is accurate before publishing a new or revised code.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She added that a pre-motion letter by Gratz &#8220;misleadingly identified as &#8216;errors&#8217; instances where the Code Council correctly published the custom code with the approval of the jurisdiction and then the identified provision was later amended.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Reynolds brothers said UpCodes uses a combination of tech and collaborating with building departments to find mistakes in the codes posted to their database. The startup’s algorithms identify potential errors in the code and the company has worked with building departments in California, Utah, North Dakota and New York City to modify and update codes in their database. For example, UpCodes worked with the California Building Standards Commission to identify missing or duplicated sections and printing errors.</p>\n<p>“We have over a million sections of code. When someone points out an error, we can fix it immediately,” said Garrett. “It sounds obvious, but having a system and a team that can fix an error within hours and deploy that to the site, across one system, is a lot better than it was historically, when you got an update and had to print it out and staple it into a book.”</p>\n<p>“Putting these codes together is an incredibly complicated process and we’re happy to help by leveraging our tech,” he added. “On the other hand, ICC would rather be a gatekeeper to the law rather than explore innovations in the industry. Codes only get more complex over time. We need new technology and innovations to keep up with the growing demands of these regulations.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View ICC vs UpCodes DecisionandOrder on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/484468546/ICC-vs-UpCodes-DecisionandOrder#from_embed\">ICC vs UpCodes DecisionandOrder</a> by <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View TechCrunch's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/publisher/17551504/TechCrunch#from_embed\">TechCrunch</a> on Scribd</p>\n<p><iframe id=\"doc_87771\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"ICC vs UpCodes DecisionandOrder\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/484468546/content?start_page=1&#38;view_mode=scroll&#38;access_key=key-Hi6PitYSeLchElhGCuTM\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7729220222793488\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3ivzDbmLZ_g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 12:55:16 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"b3c2904e3d42856acecbb76c13142a90","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Catherine Shu","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-55-903_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-45-59-494_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn95@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-18-673_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn35@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-46-12-653_673980158cc7c647.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3ivzDbmLZ_g:YrxMNfVgEeA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-45-58-640_559a23598f140538.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-04-648_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3ivzDbmLZ_g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn59@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-46-18-636_c4bc9849e23524c0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545155738},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:55","title":"Spotify adds a built-in podcast playlist creation tool, ‘Your Episodes’","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074282","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spotify\">Spotify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> today launched a new feature designed to give podcast listeners a new way to organize and save content they want to listen to at a later time or keep their favorite episodes bookmarked for easy access.

Founder and CEO Nash Ahmed wouldn&#8217;t go into too much detail about the technology that allows Undock to accomplish this. But, on the surface, users who don&#8217;t yet have Undock can temporarily link their calendar to the individual meeting request to automatically find times that work for everyone in the group. Otherwise, they can see the suggested times of the rest of the group and mark the ones that work for them.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of the journey for Undock. The company plans to launch a full-featured calendar in Q1 of 2021, that would include collaborative editing right within calendar events, and embedded video conferencing.</p>\n<p>According to Ahmed, the most important differentiating features of Undock are that it focuses on mutual availability (not just singular availability) and that it does so right within the email client.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074203\" style=\"width: 622px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074203\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/undock.gif?w=612\" alt=\"\" width=\"612\" height=\"478\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2074203\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074203\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> undock</p></div></p>\n<p>Scheduling will always be free within Undock, but the full calendar (when it&#8217;s released publicly) will have a variety of tiers starting at $10/month per user. Undock will also borrow from the Slack model and charge more for retention of information.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The greatest challenge is definitely customer education,&#8221; said Ahmed, explaining that early on some users were confused by the product&#8217;s simplicity. &#8220;We messaged it by saying it&#8217;s like autocomplete. And early users would get into their email and then ask what to do next, or if they had to go back to Undock or to the Chrome extension.
