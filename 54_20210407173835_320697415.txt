[+ How To Plan Your Own]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/breakout-session","description":"<p>Having gone to many meetings, I can definitely say that I sometimes get overwhelmed. While I enjoy the content being discussed, I can feel tired and wish for a break to decompress before throwing my mind back into absorbing the information.</p> \n<p>I’m sure I’m not alone in these feelings, that many of us want to absorb all we can while still having the opportunity to temporarily disconnect and let our minds wander.</p> \n<p>What we’re looking for is a breakout session, where meeting hosts understand and accommodate for the need to take a break and specifically carve out time for them. This post will explain what a breakout session is, explain how to plan for a successful one, and present ideas that you can incorporate into your next meeting.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download free resources for executing your best event yet.

While these sessions can be related to the overall meeting content, they can also focus on unrelated topics.</p> \n<p>Breakout sessions can happen during both in-person and virtual meetings. The former typically send attendees to different areas of a conference venue, and the latter use breakout room functions native to virtual conferencing tools. These sessions are especially important during virtual meetings, where there is already an element of built-in disconnection as attendees are in their own respective locations.</p> \n<p>Below we’ll go over some ideas that you can use to incorporate engaging breakout sessions into your upcoming meetings.</p> \n<h2>Breakout Session Ideas</h2> \n<p>There are various breakout sessions you can plan for, like those directly related to meeting content and others that are entertainment-focused and involve attendees playing games with each other.</p> \n<h3>Lightning Talks</h3> \n<p>Lightning talks are a great way to break up meeting sessions. They’re short so people can attend more than one, and a facilitator takes a set amount of time to give brief talks on a subject of their choice related to overall meeting content.</p> \n<p>However, lightning talks can also be adapted to allow facilitators to present on any topic they’re passionate about, helping attendees get to know more about each other and let their minds drift elsewhere before re-focusing on meetings.</p> \n<h3>Speed Networking</h3> \n<p>Speed networking breakout sessions allow attendees to meet each other and establish professional connections. You can divide people up, set expectations, and instruct participants to spend a set amount of time talking to one person and moving on to another once the time is up.</p> \n<h3>Games</h3> \n<p>Games can help participants let loose and de-stress, especially when they’re interactive and encourage engagement with others. These sessions are different from the other ideas on this list as they can be less related to meeting content than others.</p> \n<p>During in-person sessions, you can organize bingo games, team people up to solve puzzles, or even play charades. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/online-team-building-games?_ga=2.258830282.1142681397.1616188169-1118502603.1616188169\">Virtual games</a>&nbsp;are possible as well.</p> \n<h3>Goal-setting Sessions</h3> \n<p>Goal-setting sessions are great as they can encourage participants to think in-depth about meeting content in a relaxed setting where they can have conversations with others and express their thoughts. You can assign a facilitator to each breakout room, and they can initiate a conversation about general meeting content and encourage participants to relate the content to their desires.</p> \n<p>For example, suppose your larger meeting is focused on introducing a new business-wide workflow. In that case, attendees in these sessions can set goals surrounding what they want to accomplish with the new strategy over the next year.</p> \n<h3>Ask Me Anything (AMA) Sessions</h3> \n<p>AMA sessions are an excellent breakout idea, especially if you don’t have the chance to answer everyone's questions.</p> \n<p>Participants can be separated into different rooms and groups and ask questions or express their thoughts about what has happened during the meeting, and an experienced facilitator can be there to answer them.</p> \n<h3>Outdoor Activities</h3> \n<p>Outdoor activities are best suited for in-person meetings where groups of participants can go outside together. They can be less content-focused and involve something like a scavenger hunt, but general breakout sessions can also be held outdoors to give participants a change of scenery.</p> \n<p>However, making use of an outdoor session during a virtual meeting can involve encouraging participants to log off for a few minutes, go outside, and come back and tell the group about something they saw while they were out there, or to share a photo of an item you asked them to find and identify outside.</p> \n<h3>Open Mic Session</h3> \n<p>Open mics are always exciting, and they can be great for encouraging engagement and giving attendees a moment to have fun and learn about their peers. Open mics can center around meeting content, like having service representatives share customer stories, or unrelated and attendees stand up and share a hidden talent.</p> \n<h3>Drop-in Discussions</h3> \n<p>Drop-in discussions are a great idea as you can schedule multiple different sessions for attendees to choose from. They’re also a low-pressure format for engaging in conversation and networking. People can navigate to a room where the content is related to their interest, and even pop-in to multiple sessions if they can’t decide.</p> \n<p>While this is not an exhaustive list of ideas, they can certainly be used to create and design engaging breakout sessions for your next meeting.</p> \n<h2>Breakout Session Examples</h2> \n<p>Below we’ll go over some real-life examples of breakout sessions that can serve as additional inspiration for your planning.</p> \n<h3>Nonprofit Leadership Center</h3> \n<p>The Nonprofit Leadership Center is an organization that supports other nonprofits. It hosts a yearly leadership conference that includes multiple breakout sessions led by industry leaders that attendees can choose from.</p> \n<p>A Breakout session from their 2020 conference, <a href=\"https://nlctb.org/news/2020-leadership-conference-breakouts/\">Courageous Conversations: Understanding &amp; Confronting Unconscious Bias with Margarita Sarmiento</a>, discussed how to create work environments that were inclusive and positive for all to be part of. The breakout session related to the overarching theme of the conference, which focused on <a href=\"https://nlctb.org/events/2020-leadership-conference/\">leading courageously</a>.</p> \n<h3>Building On Our Momentum (BOOM)</h3> \n<p>Mount Holyoke College hosts an annual diversity conference called Building On Our Momentum, where community members are encouraged to attend events and learn about diversity, equity, and inclusion in live talks and recorded content.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://events.mtholyoke.edu/boom_2021\">2021 BOOM conference</a>&nbsp;incorporates various breakout sessions to help attendees engage with content in smaller groups and decompress from hard-hitting topics that they may be learning about.</p> \n<p>One of the sessions, <a href=\"https://embark.mtholyoke.edu/osi/rsvp_boot?id=1054959\">Tuesday Crafternoon: Zines</a>, encourages attendees to get creative and create a zine while simultaneously learning about their history and use in marginalized communities.</p> \n<h3>INBOUND</h3> \n<p>INBOUND is HubSpot’s annual marketing conference that features a wide variety of opportunities, including breakout sessions. During these sessions, attendees can decompress, further engage with content, and connect with other participants.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/225435/agenda/session/328400\">Meetup: Black at INBOUND</a>, an INBOUND 2020 breakout session, created a safe space for Black attendees to meet other professionals, network, and discuss topics of interest.</p> \n<h2>Breakout Session Template</h2> \n<p>Given the benefits that they can provide, it’s essential to understand how to plan for, and lead, a successful breakout session. Let’s go over some tips.</p> \n<h3>1. Set designated time frames.</h3> \n<p>As breakout sessions are specific periods between main meeting sessions, it’s crucial to set specific time frames in which they will occur. Take note of the session’s activity, how long it will take, and aim to stick to that schedule.</p> \n<h3>2. Set session goals.</h3> \n<p>Breakout sessions that are specifically designed for attendees to decompress are great, but, regardless of intention, it’s essential to set goals, so participants know what to expect.</p> \n<p>Maybe it’s simply just to network and make conversation, but it could also be to outline personal goals. Letting people know what to expect helps you ensure that these sessions stay focused and attendees can accomplish everything within the desired time frame.</p> \n<h3>3. Design seating to complement the breakout format.</h3> \n<p>This tip is more related to in-person sessions, but essential nonetheless. It’s important to create seating arrangements and set up meeting spaces that complement and facilitate the session intent.</p> \n<p>For example, a room filled with round tables wouldn’t be conducive to a speed networking session where two people are in discussion with each other. Understand what you want participants to accomplish during the decision, and design a meeting space accordingly.</p> \n<h3>4. Use the correct equipment.</h3> \n<p>Using the right equipment is relevant to both in-person and virtual breakout sessions, as you’ll want to ensure you have everything you need ahead of time. For example, suppose you’re leading a breakout session game. In that case, you want to make sure that you have all the necessary materials to run the session smoothly, like enough pieces for all participants and printable instructions to refer to during the game.</p> \n<p>Having the right equipment is also important because these sessions are meant to help people decompress, so you don’t want to leave people waiting or stressed about what is about to happen, especially during virtual events.</p> \n<p>All in all, breakout sessions are valuable aspects of meetings, both virtual and in-person. They give attendees a chance to connect with other participants, think deeply about meeting content, and generally have fun and engaging conversations.</p> \n<p>Leverage the tips on this list when planning for your next meeting, and you’ll likely receive feedback from attendees that the sessions were engaging, exciting, and have inspired them to attend your next event.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Event Marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbreakout-session&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1.png","linkMd5":"0d7b7d08505b4021d4ddebf1181121f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-07-715_6ca0430bfb5ec4d1.webp","destWidth":472,"destHeight":19,"sourceBytes":4523,"destBytes":4712,"author":"fneedle@hubspot.com (Flori Needle)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-07-715_6ca0430bfb5ec4d1.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-14-646_31f5fd92c8680d09.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbreakout-session&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn96@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-19-684_83efab9c64ed4a99.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087105},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"21 Ways To Get More Followers on Facebook","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/get-more-followers-on-facebook","description":"<p>On social media, your follower count gives you an idea of your brand awareness and reach.</p> \n<p>That's why gaining followers is often an important goal for brands, especially as they scale.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Free Resource: How to Reach &amp; Engage Your Audience on Facebook\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83.png\"></a></p> \n<p>So, how do you gain followers? We know buying them doesn't work because it rarely translates to engagement. The good news is that there are at least 20 ways to gain them organically.</p> \n<p>Let's cover them below.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Develop your Facebook marketing strategy.</h2> \n<p>Having a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-strategy-for-your-business?_ga=2.62409388.1481247633.1616124450-1598130191.1616124450\">social media strategy</a> for your Facebook Business Page is the first step in attracting followers to your brand. A robust strategy gives your team direction and a playbook from which to develop new ideas. It also helps you assess your performance from the right lens.</p> \n<p>When developing your playbook, here are a few questions to consider:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What does success look like?</li> \n <li>What does our audience want to see?</li> \n <li>How should we engage our audience?</li> \n <li>What tactics are our competitors using on Facebook?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you are clear on your approach, it will be easier to explore the growth methods outlined below.</p> \n<h2>2. Post often.</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-frequently-should-i-publish-on-social-media\">Your posting schedule</a> is undoubtedly linked to your followers. Why? The more you post, the more visible you are to your target audience and the more likely you are to reach new users.</p> \n<p>Here are two tools to streamline your publishing process:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-calendar-tools\">A content calendar</a></strong> – This is used to plan out what content you will post to your social media platforms and when they will be published. It's especially helpful to have a content calendar to align your social media content with upcoming events, such as product or service launches.</li> \n <li><strong>A social media publishing tool </strong>– Manually publishing to your Facebook Page can be time-consuming and take you away from more important tasks. With a publishing tool, you can schedule your posts to go live at a specific time and date, and have the peace of mind that your page will always be active.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>3. Host giveaways.</h2> \n<p>Giveaways can be an effective and low-cost way to build brand awareness and attract new Facebook users to your Facebook Page.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-giveaway\">To maximize the impact of your giveaway</a>, set rules that encourage audience participation. For instance, your giveaway can require each user to tag a friend in the giveaway post and make a post of their own to qualify to win.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/get-more-followers-example-png.png?width=600&amp;name=get-more-followers-example-png.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Facebook Giveaway Example \"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OREOUnitedStates/photos/a.597325737403442/995804524222226/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The more engagement you can get from your followers, the better chance your giveaway will reach new users.</p> \n<h2>4. Vary your posts.</h2> \n<p>One of the reasons why your follower count may have plateaued is because your content isn't connecting with consumers.</p> \n<p>Start experimenting with various types of posts to see what garners more shares, comments, and other forms of engagement. You may find that videos perform much better than images, or that covering certain topics get more shares than others.</p> \n<p>As you notice trends in what's working and what's not, tweak your strategy, observe, and keep experimenting.</p> \n<h2>5. Post at the right time.</h2> \n<p>If you post something on Facebook but no one's around to see it, does it make an impact?</p> \n<p>With social media, visibility is key. The first part of increasing your visibility is posting regularly, but you also have to align your posting schedule with your audience's scrolling habits.</p> \n<p>If your users are most active on Facebook between 5:00 and 9:00 PM., that's your time to publish your content. Publish outside of that window and you risk your content being missed altogether.</p> \n<h2>6. Create shareable content.</h2> \n<p>Whenever you see something that's informative, entertaining, inspiring, or just interesting, what's your first instinct nowadays? Mine is to hit the \"share\" button and send it to other people.</p> \n<p>Making shareable content is one of the best ways to get followers because it expands your reach.</p> \n<p>What makes something have that shareable quality? It varies, depending on the audience you're targeting, but one common thread is that it has to resonate. Maybe your content addresses a concern they have, or it discusses a topic they're interested in.</p> \n<p>This viral video from HubSpot garnered over 760K views and shows how to take a buzzy topic, like Game of Thrones, and apply it to your brand.</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=314&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhubspot%2Fvideos%2F10156165276484394%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>Shareable content is also easy to digest – there's a reason why the most viral videos are typically from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-tiktok\">TikTok</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-reels-examples\">Instagram Reels</a>. They're short and get to the point.</p> \n<p>For instance, this 40-second video by <a href=\"http://asos.com\">ASOS</a> is weird, funny and has over 300K views.<span style=\"color: #33475b;\"></span></p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fasos.us%2Fvideos%2F848504299231734%2F&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=380\" width=\"380\" height=\"591\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>Lastly, make sure your content is visually appealing. If your team doesn't have the bandwidth to invest internal resources to create these creative assets, consider outsourcing them through independent contractors.</p> \n<h2>7. Interact with your audience.</h2> \n<p>Facebook users, like most social media users, like to feel seen and heard by the brands they engage with. Your brand should make it a priority to interact with your followers regularly, whether it's answering a direct message or responding to a comment under your latest post.</p> \n<p>These interactions not only boost your engagement rate but can also build brand loyalty. And we all know that a consumer who is loyal to a brand will spread the word and bring on more brand promoters, serving as unofficial influencers.</p> \n<h2>8. Promote your Facebook Page everywhere.</h2> \n<p>If your goal is to gain more followers on your business page, you should direct traffic to your page whenever possible. There are a few ways to do this:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Add a Facebook plugin to your website.</li> \n <li>Include a CTA in your email newsletter to encourage your subscribers to visit your Facebook Page.</li> \n <li>Embed your Facebook posts whenever relevant in your blog posts.</li> \n <li>Host your giveaways only on Facebook.</li> \n <li>Promote your Facebook Page on other social media platforms.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>9. Add your Facebook social link to all digital platforms.</h2> \n<p>Your Facebook link should be accessible everywhere you have an online presence. This includes your website, email, and social media platforms.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/passamaquoddy-maple-example-png.png?width=600&amp;name=passamaquoddy-maple-example-png.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"&quot;Connect With Us&quot; brand example\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.passamaquoddymaple.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>It’s as simple as putting “Follow Us,” or “Connect With Us” with the social icons, as shown in the business above.</p> \n<p>The easier it is to find you, the better your chances of gaining followers.</p> \n<h2>10. Work with influencers.</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-influencer\">Working with influencers</a> is great for many reasons, the main one being the credibility they give to your brand. When an influencer promotes a brand, it's social proof (i.e., a stamp of approval).</p> \n<p>You can work with influencers to target an audience you haven't yet connected with and drive traffic to your Facebook Page.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, studies show consumers tend to trust the word of an influencer more than a brand's word. So, by collaborating with influencers, you can earn new followers who already have a certain level of trust in your brand.</p> \n<h2>11. Partner up with another brand.</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34188/what-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx\">Co-marketing </a>is a collaboration between two brands with similar audiences and marketing goals who team up for marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>A co-marketing campaign on Facebook could look like a video series released over a month or week-long Facebook Live events hosted with your partner.</p> \n<p>This strategy allows brands to use their individual distribution channels to reach new people and share the results of the campaign.</p> \n<h2>12. Offer a coupon.</h2> \n<p>In addition to giveaways, there are other ways to incentivize your audience to promote your brand, including offering coupons.</p> \n<p>With a plugin like <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/facebook-likes-popup?prev_msid=e89616a0-A6EC-43F9-2D64-50F33B8CB26D\">Shopify's Facebook Likes Popup</a>, for example, you can offer a discount code to consumers who like your Facebook Page as they are completing a purchase on your site.</p> \n<p>You can also offer discount codes to encourage Facebook reviews, which serve as social proof and can help you gain more followers.</p> \n<h2>13. Join Facebook Groups.</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-facebook-groups-examples\">Joining a Facebook Group</a> can give you direct access to your target audience.</p> \n<p>You can get direct insight into your audience's needs, concerns, likes, and dislikes. In addition, it's another channel to connect with them more intimately.</p> \n<p>But keep in mind, it's not a place for selling – use it as a way to introduce yourself to your target personas and build authentic connections.</p> \n<h2>14. Create your own Facebook Group.</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-facebook-group\">Having your own Facebook Group </a>is arguably the second-best channel you can have behind an email list.</p> \n<p>Similar to email subscribers, a Facebook Group user has opted to join your group and stays in because it adds value to their lives.</p> \n<p>It's another way to attract your target audience, build a strong community, and provide value to your user personas.</p> \n<h2>15. Learn from your Facebook Insights dashboard.</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-insights\">Your Facebook Insights dashboard</a> is where your page's analytics live.</p> \n<p>It tells you how users are behaving on your Facebook Business Page and how your posts are performing.</p> \n<p>Use it as a resource to identify which strategies are earning you followers and what's worth changing.</p> \n<h2>16. Use hashtags in your posts.</h2> \n<p>Hashtags are a great discoverability tool on Facebook. You can use them to help your target market find your post and increase your follower count.</p> \n<p>It's important to use a mix of popular and niche hashtags to ensure that your posts are getting enough visibility without disappearing in a sea of posts.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/get-more-followers-example-1-png.png?width=453&amp;name=get-more-followers-example-1-png.png\" width=\"453\" style=\"width: 453px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Example of how to use hashtags to get more followers\"></p> \n<p>For instance, <a href=\"http://powerchord.com\">PowerChord</a> used a mix of geo-specific hashtags to reach local Facebook users and topic-specific hashtags to reach audiences interested in the subject.</p> \n<h2>17. Make your page easier to find.</h2> \n<p>The last thing you want is someone who wants to follow your page but can't seem to find it. While some may be persistent, others may give up once their initial search is unsuccessful.</p> \n<p>To avoid this issue altogether, optimize your Facebook Page for search to ensure you'll always be easy to find. Here are some ways to do so:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use the same username on all your social media profiles.</li> \n <li>Add your logo to your profile picture and add a cover photo that reflects your brand.</li> \n <li>Have a complete \"About\" section.</li> \n <li>Keep your contact information and business hours updated.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>18. Don't over-promote.</h2> \n<p>Your Facebook Page should be used to connect with your target audience and publish content that resonates with them.</p> \n<p>While a certain level of promotion is expected, it shouldn’t be the majority of what you post. Depending on your industry, pushing your products and services could repel your audience and lead to high unfollow rates.</p> \n<h2>19. Authenticate your page.</h2> \n<p>Social media is rampant with bots and fake business pages aiming to deceive consumers. This can make Facebook users a little reluctant to follow brands they don't recognize.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/facebook-verification-badge-png.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Facebook verification badge example\"></p> \n<p>Authenticating your page can give your brand the credibility needed to both protect your audience against fraudulent pages and give them the reassurance they need. To request a verification badge on Facebook, you must fill out <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/342509036134712\">this form</a>.</p> \n<h2>20. Create original content.</h2> \n<p>As new social media platforms gain popularity, it's easy to recycle content from one platform to another. While that does make posting regularly easier, it may be hurting your engagement.</p> \n<p>Every social media platform is different and so are its users. For instance, Facebook users tend to prefer videos over other forms of content, <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/facebook-marketing-2019/\">according to a 2019 Buffer study</a>. The best performing content on Facebook is funny, entertaining, or practical.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, it's important to customize your content to the platform. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-repurposing-content\">Repurposing</a> can stretch the life of your content. However, it shouldn't be your only strategy. Be sure to listen to your audience and build content around their needs.</p> \n<h2>21. Run ads.</h2> \n<p>In addition to all the steps mentioned above, you can also <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-paid-ad-checklist\">run ads to reach more Facebook users. </a></p> \n<p>Facebook Ads allows you to target users based on demographics, behaviors, and interests. This guarantees that you reach users who match your user persona and are more likely to convert.</p> \n<p>Getting more followers on Facebook requires more than just posting regularly. You have to tap into what attracts your audience – through data analysis and community engagement – to develop sustainable strategies.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"generate leads with facebook\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fget-more-followers-on-facebook&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83.png","linkMd5":"55fc24e21d7f787c84c7768371c3acc8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-12-728_6a8ae002ca8736e9.webp","destWidth":612,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6310,"destBytes":9676,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-12-728_6a8ae002ca8736e9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/get-more-followers-example-png.png?width=600&name=get-more-followers-example-png.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn8@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-397_e087576acbbbee4a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/passamaquoddy-maple-example-png.png?width=600&name=passamaquoddy-maple-example-png.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn36@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-15-238_98be08dfbadb8550.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/get-more-followers-example-1-png.png?width=453&name=get-more-followers-example-1-png.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn44@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-240_46c87a7a177377e7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/facebook-verification-badge-png.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn64@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-14-388_9b46cb05483912fd.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-14-472_43149526df2d3104.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fget-more-followers-on-facebook&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-14-938_b37d04b20522fbc7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087209},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"How 7 Brands Use Facebook Stories for Business","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-of-facebook-stories","description":"<p>Whenever a new feature comes out on social media, I am usually a late adopter.</p>  \n<p>Back when Instagram launched <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories?_ga=2.202129425.1220013014.1616181815-474576179.1616181815\">Stories</a>, a worthy <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-snapchat-for-business\">Snapchat</a> opponent, I thought, \"<em>Hm, I don't know about this</em>.\" Perhaps it's because change, even if slight, is uncomfortable or just because I'm naturally a cautious person.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Free Resource: How to Reach &amp; Engage Your Audience on Facebook\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83.png\"></a></p> \n<p>But here we are a few years after its launch and I barely look at my newsfeed. Where am I? You guessed it, endlessly swiping through Stories.</p> \n<p>The feature gained steam on Instagram but was then integrated on Facebook. Now, every brand with a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/24422/the-ultimate-facebook-marketing-cheat-sheet.aspx\">Facebook Business Page</a> has gained another marketing tool to reach users.</p> \n<p>So, what exactly can you post on Facebook Stories? Get inspired by these eight brands.</p> \n<h2>Examples of Facebook Stories for Business</h2> \n<h3>A Look Behind the Scenes</h3> \n<p>Back when Facebook only allowed brands to publish posts, brands were probably more selective about their content, knowing it would stay there permanently.</p> \n<p>Now that Facebook Stories is here, brands can have a little bit more fun with what they post knowing the content will only be available for the next 24 hours.</p> \n<p>That's why behind-the-scenes content is perfect for Facebook Stories. It's not necessarily important enough to be featured on the news feed but it can be a great way to create some buzz around an upcoming release.<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-story-example-woven-nook-jpg.jpeg?width=274&amp;name=facebook-story-example-woven-nook-jpg.jpeg\" style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px; font-family: AvenirNext, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; width: 274px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" width=\"274\" alt=\"Woven Nook Facebook Story Example\">In this example, <a href=\"http://wovennook.com\">Woven Nook</a>, a home decor company, posts a Story to tease an upcoming project. The Story allows the brand to create some anticipation around the project and also gauge the audience's interest in this type of content.</p> \n<p>Another important element in this Story is that it features one of the founders of the company. In recent years, <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/social-media-connection/\">studies have shown </a>that consumers connect more with brands who pull back the curtains and show the faces behind the business.</p> \n<p>Woven Nook could have posted the sneak peek without the founder. However, having a human featured in the image can leave a stronger impression than just a setting.</p> \n<h3>Polls and Surveys</h3> \n<p>Facebook Stories isn't just another publishing channel, it also has great features that help brands connect with and engage their audience. Engagement is vital for building brand loyalty and understanding your consumers.</p> \n<p>The better you understand them, the better equipped you are to deliver content that resonates.</p> \n<p>The grocery delivery company <a href=\"http://instacart.com\">Instacart</a> hosted its own trivia game on Facebook Stories to test its audience's food knowledge.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Instacart Facebook Story Example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Examples%20of%20Facebook%20Stories%20for%20Business.gif?width=218&amp;name=Examples%20of%20Facebook%20Stories%20for%20Business.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 218px;\" title=\"\" width=\"218\"></p> \n<p>While this may not necessarily give the brand valuable insight into their audience, their engagement with the post may tell them a lot about the type of content their followers enjoy.</p> \n<p>Want another way to use polls? Tie them to a product or service.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Story-Example-alaffia.jpg?width=250&amp;name=Facebook-Story-Example-alaffia.jpg\" alt=\"Alaffia Facebook Story Example \" width=\"250\" style=\"width: 250px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.alaffia.com/\">Alaffia</a> posted a simple poll asking its audience about its product.</p> \n<p>This accomplished two things at once: It introduced followers to a product they may not yet know and it had an interactive element that encouraged audience engagement.</p> \n<h3>User-Generated Content</h3> \n<p>One of the most popular uses for Facebook Stories is user-generated content (UGC). UGC provides what's known as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/psychology-social-proof\">social proof</a>, a psychological phenomenon where we tend to look to others for guidance on what to do.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-story-example-adjourn.jpg?width=250&amp;name=facebook-story-example-adjourn.jpg\" alt=\"Adjourn TeaHouse facebook story example \" width=\"250\" style=\"width: 250px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.adjournteahouse.com/\">Adjourn Teahouse</a> leverages UGC to show the various ways in which consumers use its products. Because of the Facebook Stories repost feature, the brand can fill its Stories with content already created by others, saving both time and money.</p> \n<p>One thing to note is that because Facebook now owns Instagram, you can repost another user's Instagram content to your Facebook Stories – something that's not available between other social media platforms.</p> \n<p>The brand <a href=\"https://curls.biz/\">Curls</a> uses this same approach to promote its products.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Curls Facebook Story Example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Examples%20of%20Facebook%20Stories%20for%20Business-1.gif?width=234&amp;name=Examples%20of%20Facebook%20Stories%20for%20Business-1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 234px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"234\"></p> \n<p>What brand doesn't love free promotion? This type of UGC helps brands gain credibility and earn new customers.</p> \n<h3>Direct to Website Traffic</h3> \n<p>Have an article on your website you want your Facebook followers to read? Take advantage of the \"‘See More\" feature on Facebook Stories. <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-stories-example-blavity.jpg?width=250&amp;name=facebook-stories-example-blavity.jpg\" alt=\"Blavity facebook stories example\" width=\"250\" style=\"width: 250px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><a href=\"https://blavityinc.com/\">Blavity</a>, a news and media company, often uses this feature to lead Facebook users to its blog posts.</p> \n<p>While this brand mostly directs traffic to its blog posts, businesses can use this feature to lead their followers to landing pages, product pages, or any other webpage.</p> \n<p>What's great about this tool is that it makes it easy for users to navigate to other channels from the brand without ever leaving the Facebook platform.</p> \n<h3>Giveaways</h3> \n<p>If you're<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-giveaway\"> hosting a giveaway,</a> you'll likely create a Facebook post so that users can access it beyond the 24-hour window. However, it's important to promote the giveaway on other channels to give it more visibility.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-stories-example-Blk%26bold.jpg?width=250&amp;name=facebook-stories-example-Blk%26bold.jpg\" alt=\"Blk &amp; Bold facebook stories example\" width=\"250\" style=\"width: 250px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Note how beverage company <a href=\"https://blkandbold.com/\">BLK &amp; Bold</a> promoted its giveaway on Facebook Stories. Instead of posting all of the giveaway details, like the rules and eligibility requirements, the brand highlighted what its audience is most excited most: the giveaway itself.</p> \n<p>If your giveaway is hosted on another social media platform – say Instagram or Twitter – you can still promote it on your Facebook Story and use the \"See More\" feature.</p> \n<p>There's no right or wrong way to post on Facebook Stories. It's all about finding what stories resonate best with your audience.</p> \n<p>Every Story you post is an opportunity to connect with your audience and learn more about them.</p> \n<p>While some of these strategies may not work for your brand, they're worth trying out. Because even stories that don't perform well give you as much insight as those that do.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"generate leads with facebook\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fexamples-of-facebook-stories&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83.png","linkMd5":"aa45c829e78cee3627dc62dd837f6b79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-12-728_6a8ae002ca8736e9.webp","destWidth":612,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6310,"destBytes":9676,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-12-728_6a8ae002ca8736e9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-story-example-woven-nook-jpg.jpeg?width=274&name=facebook-story-example-woven-nook-jpg.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn76@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-447_7113f91785a0f5be.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Examples%20of%20Facebook%20Stories%20for%20Business.gif?width=218&name=Examples%20of%20Facebook%20Stories%20for%20Business.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn88@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-17-571_3776e0f5fcb6eed6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Story-Example-alaffia.jpg?width=250&name=Facebook-Story-Example-alaffia.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn39@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-15-109_9d2b0ba2299619d7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-story-example-adjourn.jpg?width=250&name=facebook-story-example-adjourn.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn29@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-14-216_169f3edea34afc91.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Examples%20of%20Facebook%20Stories%20for%20Business-1.gif?width=234&name=Examples%20of%20Facebook%20Stories%20for%20Business-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn72@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-15-687_4b087801008839a3.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-stories-example-blavity.jpg?width=250&name=facebook-stories-example-blavity.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-15-085_649c2b516cf64da2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-stories-example-Blk%26bold.jpg?width=250&name=facebook-stories-example-Blk%26bold.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn56@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-14-765_5dfac659b8325908.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-14-472_43149526df2d3104.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fexamples-of-facebook-stories&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn48@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-14-806_90ccf2465f0f8d40.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087157},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Marketing Trends in 2021","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-trends","description":"<p>Marketing moves at the speed of light … er, at least it feels that way when you’re brainstorming a new campaign or strategy, and all of a sudden, a new statistic or technology release changes <em>everything</em>.</p>  \n<p>On a yearly, quarterly, and even monthly basis, new trends and techniques pop up and transform the way we attract, connect with, and market to our audiences.</p> \n<p>But keeping up with these changes isn’t always enough. To succeed in the fast-paced, marketing world, you have to stay <i>ahead</i> of the game. That’s why we created this guide — influenced by some of our very own HubSpot experts — so you can bookmark and return to some of the most important marketing trends of today, time and time again.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3d0bc27a-898d-40d5-aa46-8696ed81c4ee&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: State of Marketing Report [2020 Version]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d0bc27a-898d-40d5-aa46-8696ed81c4ee.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Why use marketing trends?</h2> \n<p>If a certain marketing strategy or approach has consistently worked for your business, why change it?</p> \n<p>Well, just because something works now doesn't mean it'll work again in the future. You have to be one step ahead, or at least keep up with the emerging trends, that will impact your marketing success the next time around. So, other than keeping up with developments in the industry, why should your business care about marketing trends?</p> \n<p><strong>Marketing trends allow you to:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Keep up with the way your consumers shop and research your products and services (and those of your competitors')</li> \n <li>Stay up to date with changes in consumer behavior and priorities</li> \n <li>Ensure you're ahead of the curve in terms of knowing who your target audience is and what they need from your business</li> \n <li>Listen and respond to changes in the market to help you save money</li> \n <li>Stay relevant in your target marketplace and among your competitors (now and in the long run)</li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<p>As we've said, many things change in the marketing world — and they do so frequently. That's why we've listed some of the most popular types of marketing trends — and an example or two of each — to help you adapt to these developments as needed and to equip your business with the knowledge necessary for you to succeed.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Invest in inbound marketing.</h3> \n<p>This past year, the world dealt with unprecedented change, and outbound marketing tactics became less effective in reaching prospects and leads. The shift from in-person to hybrid work from home (WFH) business practices have made inbound marketing come to the forefront of effective tactics. For example, there’s been a significant rise in virtual events due to COVID-19 forcing marketers to get creative to catch the attention of customers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhazard/\">John Hazard</a>, the founder and content strategist at digital marketing agency Lighthouse Creative Group, sees this as a place of opportunity to generate interest despite their typical formulaic production. “Screen fatigue is a big issue for brands. As virtual events have exploded as a replacement for in-person engagement, every business has tried to roll out ‘events’, webinars, and virtual conferences. But most are just PowerPoint presentations or an executive talking with their kitchen in the background.

Video can be a valuable addition to both sales and customer service efforts.”</p> \n<p>In the past, video was limited due to costly resources and production. Today, it’s much more accessible.

Reach new audiences with native advertising.</h3> \n<p>When your brand pays to feature content on a third-party website, you’re investing in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/native-advertising-what-you-need-to-know\">native advertising</a>. Unlike traditional advertising, which is designed to interrupt and stand out, native advertising is designed to blend in and promote your brand to a new audience who might otherwise never learn about you.</p> \n<p>Because native ads don’t “feel” like traditional ads, consumers are more likely to consume them — in fact, consumers view native ads over <a href=\"https://www.sharethrough.com/resources/in-feed-ads-vs-banner-ads/\">50% more</a> than banner ads. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/native-advertising-examples\">Examples of native advertising</a> can be found on social media, through search engine results, content recommendation platforms (those links to various other content you can click at the bottom of the page to read more on or related to the topic), or in campaigns.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\">Instagram</a> is a popular social media network that routinely partners with brands for native advertising. By taking advantage of the Instagram Story or Shop features, brands are able to share posts that look similar to the average user’s followers posting style, while subtly advertising a product.<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IrC4OdtMmbZyv7SAvoeTbn-u1oU_HuX1_ymOcpLyKoDx3o4-57SAD5NFR8oN0vIXO3V9AT859gZAMDxZr6TAziNk0K46aB1mMfHRBdNQf0NpRujrcg17Lr7iEJkNRJU464amnNHH\" width=\"624\" height=\"324\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"instagram native advertising for makeup on iphone\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://taplink.at/en/blog/native_advertising_what_it_is_examples_of_native_advertising_on_instagram.html\"><em>Source</em></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To incorporate native advertising in your marketing efforts, look for publications relevant to your brand.

Be Transparent with Diversity and Inclusion.</h3> \n<p>As the Coronavirus pandemic took its toll on the world, it highlighted the pains that employees had to endure in the workplace and in politics. Employees became more vocal about their frustrations about feeling unequal as members of society and in their treatment in office.</p> \n<p>Companies are now moving their social media strategies to include more diversity and inclusion initiatives, and it’s a good marketing move as well. The Senior Lecturer in Leadership and Innovation, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/halgregersen/\">Hal Gregersen</a>, shares his perspective on the subject:</p> \n<p>“If there can be a perfect storm of opportunity for strengthening D&amp;I [diversity and inclusion] in organizations, I believe it is happening now. I saw public and private conversations about diversity, equity, and fairness reach new heights during 2020, which will likely cause barriers to change or fade. With the pandemic, traditional ways of doing business and of working were upended, and now, barriers to the idea of change are dissolving.”</p> \n<p>Companies that are trying to change with the times should become more transparent about their efforts to make the workplace more equal and their plans to expand their diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p> \n<h3>6. Leverage both ephemeral and permanent social media content.</h3> \n<p>Not all social media is created equal. Different types of content do better on various platforms. This includes ephemeral (fleeting) and permanent (long-lasting) social media content. Let's take a deeper look at ephemeral vs. permanent social content:</p> \n<h4><strong>Ephemeral Social Media Marketing</strong></h4> \n<p>Today, Instagram and Facebook Stories specifically make the creation of ephemeral content simple — Instagram and Facebook Stories are photos and videos that live for 24-hours before disappearing “forever”. (Well, not really … there’s an Archive feature where all your Stories reside after they expire. But you get the gist.)</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyhendricksondesign/\">Kelly Hendrickson</a>, a social media marketing manager at HubSpot, says: “Ephemeral content versus permanent content is often dictated by the social platform, as well as by the audience's behavior on the platform.”</p> \n<p>Take Instagram, for example:</p> \n<p>“[Instagram] Stories are soaring in popularity, and the user behavior on Stories leans toward playful, low-fi, quick content with heavy use of features within the UX (gifs, boomerangs, polls, etc). Their fleeting design isn’t the only differentiating factor. Instagram Stories can be heavily edited, too, with filters, GIFs, colored text, and more. Because of these fun additions, brands have added a brand new strategy for producing and publishing ephemeral content that varies from their other social media content.”</p> \n<h4><strong>Permanent Social Media Content</strong></h4> \n<p>Permanent content is a little different:</p> \n<p>“Instagram can organically serve up a wall post across a wide span of time, so there's less of an opportunity for brands to be timely (who wants to see New Year's post when they’ve already given up on their resolutions?!). Since Instagram users are more <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/\">active on weekdays</a>, during the standard workday, it seems users are looking for a break!</p> \n<p>It’s critical to use your brand voice and point of view to find how you can serve your audience during that break. Should your presence be inspirational, beautiful, informative, playful, or trendy? They all have a place on Instagram’s permanent wall, it just needs to match your brand’s message.”</p> \n<p>By combining ephemeral and permanent social media content on platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, you allow your business to showcase more of your brand’s personality and flair.</p> \n<p>Hendrickson says, “The combo of a running clock and a lively audience is a huge opportunity for brands to lean into quick, in-the-moment content that showcases the more light-hearted elements of their brand. Succinctness and clarity are key in content.”</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-stories-for-small-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;__hstc=233546881.080e9234ed39e55808621ab8e2d9e8e2.1617122470747.1617122470747.1617122470747.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1617122470748&amp;__hsfp=2277871135&amp;_ga=2.196199530.736585117.1617122469-1923623018.1617122469\">Instagram Stories for Business: 6 Tips from the Pros</a><br><br></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>7. Work with micro-influencers.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\">Influencer marketing</a> plays a major role in all types of modern marketing (ads, videos, social media, blogs). But businesses are no longer limited to major celebrities and names that <em>everyone</em> knows when deciding to work with an influencer.</p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/micro-influencer-marketing\">micro-influencers</a> have found their niche in the social media world, too — and it's a big role they've started to play in converting leads, connecting with audience members, and boosting brand awareness.</p> \n<p>Micro-influencers are social media promoters with a smaller, niche following (typically, thousands to tens-of-thousands of followers). Although these folks may have fewer followers, their posts often pack more punch due to their higher level of engagement.</p> \n<p>Additionally, since they’re considered “average” and “everyday” people (unlike hard-to-reach celebrities), audience members view micro-influencers more like friends and family and, therefore, are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers?_ga=2.95753756.1692201945.1563204441-527251855.1560789477\">more likely to trust their opinions and recommendations</a>.</p> \n<p>Rosie, known as The Londoner, is a popular travel and lifestyle influencer on Instagram.

Repurposing content across channels.</h3> \n<p>This marketing trend is going to be a much bigger focus for many marketers this year. Companies that already have poured their energy into creating high-quality content should be making it more accessible on different platforms, and more up to date.</p> \n<p>Instead of coming up with new ideas, marketers are going to be taking what’s worked in the past and optimizing it for the present.</p> \n<p>In SEO, keeping your content up to date and full of rich, engaging content will outweigh older work that is lacking in keyword relevancy with old statistics and links. Not only that, but taking existing content and repurposing it for a new podcast, webinar, or blog post can be an efficient way to keep it relevant in search engines.</p> \n<h3>9. Implement voice search tactics.</h3> \n<p>It's probably safe to assume you’ve used Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and/ or Google Assistant in the last month or so. Am I right?</p> \n<p>Not only do these digital assistants answer short, informational queries such as “<em>Who is the actor in Mission: Impossible?</em>” or “<em>What’s the weather in Boston today?</em>”, but they’ve also started to process more local, conversational, and customized searches. These may sound like, “<em>Where’s a nearby coffee shop I can work from today?</em>”, “<em>How late is it open?</em>”, and “<em>Do they serve iced coffee?</em>”</p> \n<p>Because of this emerging behavior, businesses need to respond and change the way they frame information. Instead of catering to Google’s manual search algorithm, <strong>optimize your content by</strong> <strong>framing it around questions</strong>.</p> \n<p>When you implement voice search tactics this way, you'll empower your users to get the answers they want and need. They can ask a question in that conversational tone we mentioned above and, in return, they'll get a high-quality and accurate response. They can multitask while asking questions and receiving answers, as well as get those answers they're looking for more quickly.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajafrost/\">Aja Frost</a>, Head of English SEO at HubSpot, says: “Businesses should look at a topic and say, ‘<em>What questions could users ask about this?</em>’ Then, they should plan sub-topics accordingly and look for opportunities to insert questions as headers. This will allow voice assistants to easily grab questions and recognize content as solutions.”</p> \n<p>Frost also encourages businesses to look for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/winning-googles-featured-snippet\">featured snippet</a> opportunities, which are the information previews Google provides when users search for definitions or questions. Voice assistants typically pull responses directly from these boxes.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-conduct-technical-seo-audit?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Conduct a Technical SEO Audit</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-myths?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;_ga=2.257608067.966330271.1565107559-1493293515.1553017609\">22 SEO Myths to Leave Behind in 2019</a><br><br></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>10.

Due to this, businesses should ensure their website is discoverable and <i>readable</i> via mobile devices including smartphones and tablets. Website speed is also becoming important as Google prioritizes better performing websites in their search engine results pages (SERPs).</p> \n<p>Become familiar with how to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/mobile-website-design-examples\">design and optimize your website for mobile use</a>. This typically requires a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/responsive-web-design\">responsive design</a> — meaning your website will “respond” and change its design and layout as users access it on their desktop versus their smartphone.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketers-guide-to-mobile?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;_ga=2.257608067.966330271.1565107559-1493293515.1553017609\">The Marketer's Guide to Mobile</a><br><br></li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Technology Marketing Trends</h2> \n<p>Similar to marketing, technology is also ever-changing — and it's happening equally as fast (if not faster). There are a number of ways to use technology to your advantage when it comes to your marketing, especially since so many new opportunities are emerging every day.<br><br></p> \n<h3>11. Improving content experience.</h3> \n<p>Clicking onto a landing page plagued in slow pop-ups, advertisements, and cluttered formatting is an easy way to convince readers to leave it. While your company’s product or service should be a main focus, the way you present it should be just as important.</p> \n<p>If customers have a hard time navigating your website, it will be more frustrating to continue digging through it than to look elsewhere for content.</p> \n<p>Clear web pages with visually interesting segments will give your company the chance to attract prospects. For example, web design company Lounge Lizard shows the future of a stunning, interactive, quick loading home page.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jl0nf4KFV3T7a-Ig97kOdi68NXqqnojHYpuOIE3znN3z50uaaSqoRCvI8cYjR17OMcl3WgZn8bQ1bP7-4EJZmOAzblAH6ykD7H2Ge2ISNvOnZwX53hNVqDmVnRWE7zNDe4TKNypz\" width=\"624\" height=\"383\" alt=\"lounge lizard interactive fast loading home page\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.loungelizard.com/\"><em>Source</em></a></p> \n<p>Implementing interactive content and better UX and UI design for a website is a marketing trend that will never become obsolete.</p> \n<h3>12. Integrate artificial intelligence (AI).</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/stories/artificial-intelligence?__hstc=233546881.080e9234ed39e55808621ab8e2d9e8e2.1617122470747.1617122470747.1617122470747.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1617122470748&amp;__hsfp=2277871135&amp;_ga=2.201059688.736585117.1617122469-1923623018.1617122469\">Artificial intelligence</a> refers to a subset of computer science that teaches machines to do things that would require intelligence if done by a human. Think of tasks like learning, seeing, talking, socializing, reasoning, or problem-solving. When completed by computers, they’re considered AI.</p> \n<p>AI has completely infiltrated our daily lives and tasks. When Spotify recommends a song, Facebook recognizes and tags a person, or you text a friend using Siri, you’re tapping into AI. As we utilize AI more and more (especially as consumers), marketers and businesses will need to respond.</p> \n<p>The point of AI isn’t to replace humans or the need for a human touch. It’s to improve and expand our ability to connect with our audience and help them solve their problems quicker and more thoroughly.</p> \n<p>In fact, authenticity in marketing is <a href=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/marketing/authenticity-in-marketing-why-does-it-matter\">more important than ever</a> to consumers. AI is also incredibly helpful when collecting and analyzing data and making data-driven decisions. So, research ways you can incorporate AI into your business's marketing strategies to better serve your consumers and to make your life simpler.</p> \n<h3>13. Use virtual reality (VR) &amp; augmented reality (AR).</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/virtual-reality-vr\">Virtual reality</a> is viewing a computer-generated, lifelike scenario. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/augmented-reality-ar\">Augmented reality</a> is viewing the real world augmented with visual, haptic, olfactory or visual additions. VR and AR offer different experiences, but both are making waves in the marketing world today.</p> \n<p>They’re affecting your lives, too. Ever watched a 360° video on Facebook? That’s VR. What about IKEA’s <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ikea-place/id1279244498?mt=8\">IKEA PLACE app</a> which helps you visualize virtual furniture in your very real room? That’s AR.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; padding: 0;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.07%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-target-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/r0ViFTEb8aQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>VR and AR are used to supplement and improve customer experiences online and at events. Generally speaking, this is a trend marketers have been slower to adopt due to pricey equipment and bulky headsets. But, as VR glasses and AR apps become more accessible, businesses can expect to add this technology to their marketing strategy.<br><br></p> \n<h3><strong>14. Include chatbots on your site. </strong></h3> \n<p>Did you know that more than half of consumers expect a response <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/live-chat-go-to-market-flaw\">within 10 minutes</a> to any marketing, sales, or customer service inquiry? How can this be humanly possible?</p> \n<p>It’s not … for humans, anyway. Enter: <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/stories/chatbot-marketing-future\">Chatbots</a>.</p> \n<p>Bots are powered by a computer program that automates certain tasks, typically by chatting with a user through a conversational interface. Bots are made possible by artificial intelligence which helps it understand complex requests, personalize responses, and improve interactions over time.</p> \n<p>Bots provide quick, easy solutions to problems of all levels of complexity. No longer is the need for live chat or a literal one-to-one digital conversation. Bots provide the perception and dedication of a 1:1 service experience while working with hundreds of customers — something that no customer service representative or team would ever be able to do.</p> \n<p>To the consumers who hate repeating themselves to multiple sales or service representatives (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/live-chat-go-to-market-flaw\">33%, to be exact</a>), listen up — chatbots are and will continue making your lives <i style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;\">much</i> easier. If used correctly, they manage conversations at scale and aggregate data from multiple sources of data, from calendars to knowledge bases to blog posts and videos.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; padding: 0;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.07%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-target-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wL7-PoiBiKM\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jondick/\">Jon Dick</a>, SVP of Marketing at HubSpot, says: “It’s on you to make things as easy as possible.

You should already know, and have a plan to fix it.”</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/stay-current-emerging-tech?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Stay Current on Emerging Technology Trends</a><br><br></li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Privacy Marketing Trends</h2> \n<p>In the marketing world, data is highly valuable … and not just valuable to <i>you</i>, as a marketer or business owner. Whether it's an email address, credit card information, or smartphone location, consumers also view their data as precious and privileged — and it’s your responsibility to take care of it.<br><br></p> \n<h3>15. Give your customers greater control over their data.</h3> \n<p>Whether a software company, bank, government agency, or lemonade stand, every business operates using data. It’s the lifeblood of all things marketing, sales, service, and more.</p> \n<p>And hackers know it. When data breaches happen, precious information is siphoned into the wrong hands, leading to untrustworthy businesses and exploited consumers.</p> \n<p>That’s why the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/general-data-protection-regulation-consumer-attitudes\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) was enacted — it's an effort by the EU to give greater control to consumers over their data. Under the GDPR, organizations must ensure that their data is collected legally and safely and that those who collect and manage said data will protect it and respect consumers’ rights.</p> \n<p>Following the GDPR guidelines might seem like a burden, but being fined for non-compliance will feel much heavier; fines range from 10 million euros to 4% of a company's annual global revenue.</p> \n<p>Is this a risk you want to take?</p> \n<p>Probably not — so, do your research. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/data-privacy/gdpr?_ga=2.55356707.966330271.1565107559-1493293515.1553017609\">Learn about GDPR</a> and peruse our <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/data-privacy/gdpr-checklist?_ga=2.18549425.966330271.1565107559-1493293515.1553017609\">GDPR checklist</a> to ensure your business is compliant.<br><br></p> \n<h2>Use Marketing Trends to Grow Better</h2> \n<p>You’re up to speed … for now.

But when you log in to each of these social networks, it's likely that you don't want to be bombarded by every single update from every single connection. That'd be pretty overwhelming, wouldn't it?</p> \n<p>That's how the folks from each of these social networks feel — and they've done plenty of user research to validate that feeling. In fact, that's exactly why the news feeds — and the algorithms behind them — exist.</p> \n<p>All three of today's most popular social networks have gravitated toward an algorithm-based feed in the effort to create better experiences for their users. The trouble is, each algorithm works differently. What's worse, they're constantly changing, making it hard for marketers like us to keep up.</p> \n<p>To help get it all straight, we've put together this simple guide on how the news feed works on the three most popular social networks: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Let's dive in.</p> \n<p><strong>Note: </strong> Keep in mind that the algorithms are constantly changing. We'll continue to write about major social algorithm changes as they happen.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3dc1dfd9-2cb4-4498-8c57-19dbb5671820&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Social Media Trends in 2021 [Free Report]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3dc1dfd9-2cb4-4498-8c57-19dbb5671820.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>Facebook's News Feed Algorithm</h2> \n<p>Since the inception of the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/\">largest social media platform </a>to date, Facebook's news feed has been focused on personalizing the social media app's user experience. <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/social-networks-see-boosts-in-engagement-among-users-but-not-equally\">According to eMarketer</a>, we spend about 34 minutes each day using the platform.</p> \n<p>To give users the best experience possible, Facebook's team of engineers are constantly studying user behavior and picking up signals that show what kind of content each user is most interested in.</p> \n<h3>How It Works</h3> \n<p>The Like button has always been the epicenter of Facebook's user experience — not only because we see it on everyone's posts, but because it allows us to personalize our experience (and influence everyone else's). Since it was first introduced <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2015/10/cursed-project-short-history-facebook-button\">in November 2007</a>, it's helped Facebook's engineers figure out which posts were delighting users, boring them, offending them, and so on.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, the algorithm that governs Facebook's News Feed has become much more sophisticated. It isn't just about the Like button anymore — and not just because <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing\">reaction buttons are now in the mix</a>. In fact, Facebook's algorithm is by far the most complicated of the three social networks covered in this post.</p> \n<p>Here's a quick rundown of the most important things Facebook's algorithm takes into account.</p> \n<h4>Relevancy Score</h4> \n<p>When picking posts for each person who logs on to Facebook, the News Feed algorithm takes into account hundreds of variables — and can predict whether a given user will Like, click, comment, share, hide, or even mark a post as spam.</p> \n<p>More specifically, the algorithm predicts each of these outcomes with a certain degree of confidence. This prediction is quantified into a single number called a \"relevancy score\" that's specific both to you and to that post.</p> \n<p>Once every post that could potentially show up in your feed has been assigned a relevancy score, Facebook's sorting algorithm ranks them and puts them in the order they end up appearing in your feed. This means that every time you log in, the post you see at the top of your News Feed was chosen over thousands of others as the one most likely to make you react and engage.</p> \n<p>Ads are given relevancy scores, too, so that Facebook can show users the ads that could matter most to them. Again, this is supposed to give users a better experience — but it's also helpful for the businesses that are paying for the ads. It's calculated based on the positive feedback (video views, conversions, etc.) and negative feedback Facebook expects an ad to receive from its target audience. (Learn more about relevancy score for Facebook ads <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/relevance-score\">here</a>.)</p> \n<h4>Prioritizing Friends</h4> \n<p>Before 2015, Facebook was predicting what users want to see on the News Feed based on more indirect signals, like Likes, comments, and shares of others. Eventually, it <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/07/news-feed-fyi-a-better-understanding-of-hide/\">added options for users to filter out posts they don't want to see</a>. But what about helping boost the posts users do want to see?</p> \n<p>Through studies and surveys, Facebook found that many users were concerned about missing important updates from friends they cared about the most. In response to these concerns, the social media platform began changing the News Feed algorithm to give more control to the users themselves.</p> \n<p>It started <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-updates-news-feed-algorithm?_ga=1.105819395.1866822358.1456501228\">in April 2015</a>, when the company began giving priority (in the form of higher relevancy scores) to posts from friends over the Pages they follow and promotional posts. Later that year, in July, Facebook <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/07/updated-controls-for-news-feed/\">introduced the \"See First\" feature</a>, which lets you actually hand-pick which accounts — whether friends or followed Pages — you want to see first at the top of your News Feed.</p> \n<p>Now, when you want to prioritize a person or page to \"see first,\" their posts will appear at the top of your News Feed. To prioritize the people or pages you want to \"see first\": click the <strong>downward facing arrow</strong> in the top-right corner of any Facebook page and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Set up the see first feature in Facebook\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-1.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<p>In the window that appears, scroll until you find <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">News Feed Preferences</span> and select it.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Facebook newsfeed preferences\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<p>Next, select <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Prioritize who to see first</span>.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"prioritize who to see first in facebook\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-3.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<p>Finally, select up to 30 of your Facebook friends to add as favorites. You'll now see posts from these individuals first.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"add friends to facebook favorities\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-2.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<h4>Time Spent on a Post</h4> \n<p>Facebook started monitoring how much time users spend viewing certain posts. Of course, the time you spend on a post can vary depending on your internet speed, the length of the post, and so on — and the folks at Facebook are aware of that.</p> \n<p>However, the platform's strategists found that <a href=\"https://glean.info/dwell-time-a-rising-metric-for-social-media-seo-content-marketing/#:~:text=More%20specifically%2C%20dwell%20time%20is,Yext%2C%20in%20Search%20Engine%20Journal.\">dwell time</a>, the act of spending a lot more time on a particular post in their feed compared to the majority of other posts they look at, is a good sign that the content was relevant to them.</p> \n<p>How does this play out in the feed? If you spend more time on a particular post, <a href=\"http://wallaroomedia.com/facebook-newsfeed-algorithm-change-history/\">Facebook is more likely </a>to show that post on your friends' News Feeds.</p> \n<h4>Video Engagement</h4> \n<p>In summer 2015, Facebook surveyed users on how they interacted with video on their News Feeds and found that that many people who were interested in a given video didn't necessarily Like it, comment on it, or share it with their friends. Since engagement is one of the primary ways Facebook measures people's interest in posts, it had to come up with other ways to figure out whether people enjoyed the videos they were seeing.</p> \n<p>To do that, the company started monitoring other forms of video engagement — like turning on the audio, switching to full-screen mode, or enabling high definition. So if you turn up the volume on a video or make it full-screen, the algorithm will interpret that as you enjoying the video, and will show you similar videos higher up in your feed.</p> \n<p>The update doesn't mean users will see more videos in their News Feed — only those who already engage more with video-related content.</p> \n<p>Facebook's algorithm is very, very complex, but we hope that gives you a good idea of what it considers important so you can tweak your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-algorithm-works-facebook-twitter-instagram&amp;hubs_post-cta=Facebook%20marketing\">Facebook marketing </a>strategy accordingly. Now, let's move on to Twitter.</p> \n<h2>Twitter's Timeline Algorithm</h2> \n<p>Whereas Facebook makes most of the decisions about what will show up in your Facebook News Feed, Twitter's historically taken a very different approach with what it calls the \"Timeline.\"</p> \n<p>Your Timeline is the stream of tweets from the users you follow that shows up on your account home page when you first log in. It used to be that your Timeline was made up of every single tweet from every user you follow, in chronological order. But the folks at Twitter found that, similarly to what was happening on Facebook, users felt they were missing all the best tweets from the people they care about most.</p> \n<p>The changes made to the Twitter algorithm aren't nearly as platform-changing as the ones Facebook have made, but they are somewhat of a departure from the real-time element that has defined Twitter since the beginning.</p> \n<h3>How It Works</h3> \n<p>The engineers at Twitter have attempted two different approaches for surfacing the \"best\" tweets first on your Timeline: the \"While You Were Away\" feature and the even newer \"Show me the best Tweets first\" feature.</p> \n<h4>The \"While You Were Away\" Feature</h4> \n<p>This feature was added as an attempt to rid users of whatever FOMO (fear of missing out) they might have been feeling from the chronological nature of the original Timeline.</p> \n<p>Basically, it's a recap of some of the best tweets you may not have seen otherwise. How do these tweets make the cut? It's determined by \"user engagement\".</p> \n<p>You can't turn off the feature, but how often you see it depends on how often you use Twitter. The recaps pop up more frequently for users who check the app less often.</p> \n<h4>The \"Show Me the Best Tweets First\" Feature</h4> \n<p>The \"Show me the best Tweets first\" feature is a little more similar to Facebook's News Feed. Why? Because it actually changes the content on your Timeline based on a tweet's relevancy, rather than listing tweets chronologically.</p> \n<p>By default, Twitter's algorithm puts the tweets it thinks you'll find most interesting at the top of your Timeline, these posts are still recent and in reverse chronological order. These tweets are chosen based on accounts you interact with most, tweets you engage with, and much more.</p> \n<h4>The \"Best Tweets\" Feature</h4> \n<p>The rest of the tweets will be displayed right underneath, also in reverse chronological order. Unlike the \"While you were away\" feature, these \"best tweets\" won't be highlighted or indicated in any way — so you won't be able to tell where the \"best tweets\" stop and the rest of the tweets begin.</p> \n<p>There are two ways to remove these \"best tweets\" from the top of your Timeline. One is a quick fix: You can always refresh your Timeline to see all new tweets at the top in the live way you might have been used to seeing in the past.</p> \n<p>But if you want to always see your Timeline live, then Twitter does allow you to opt out of this feature if you'd like — unlike Facebook's News Feed.</p> \n<p>To opt out of this feature: Tap the three-star iconin the top right corner of your screen. Then tap Switch to latest Tweets.</p> \n<h3><img alt=\"Set your Twitter timeline to see latest tweets first\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-4.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-4.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></h3> \n<h3>Is Twitter Moving Away From a Real-Time Timeline?</h3> \n<p>There's no reason to believe so — at least not right now. One of the three sections of your Twitter timeline is composed of tweets displayed in reverse-chronological order. After you scroll through the \"While you were away\" Tweets and \"Best Tweets\" you'll be left with the tweets from your followers starting with the most recent.</p> \n<p>What might be an emerging trend on Twitter is the opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-reacts-super-follows-subscription-feature-riptwitter-1572262\">subscribe to people's tweets</a>. While this feature wouldn't disrupt the timeline's mostly reverse-chronological order, it could add just one more section to your feed that you'll need to scroll through before seeing the latest updates from your followers.</p> \n<p>Twitter isn't the only social media platform iterating its algorithm to show the most interesting content first — Instagram's algorithm is giving Facebook and Twitter a run for their money.</p> \n<h2>The Instagram Feed's Algorithm</h2> \n<p>As of January 2021, Instagram has more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/\">1.2 million active users </a>on the platform making it a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/instagram-marketing\">hotspot for marketers </a>in nearly any industry. However, it's a newer platform compared to the other two on this list, so many of us marketers are still trying to figure it out. The best place to start is from the bottom up — with the algorithm.</p> \n<p>Instagram's algorithm has evolved since 2016 when it first began sorting users' news feeds in order of relevance rather than recency. Now, the algorithm works similarly to its parent company's — Facebook. Using machine learning to aggregate six factors, Instagram can determine what content you'll appreciate the most and influence your news feed to prioritize that content.</p> \n<p>These six factors shared by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/\">TechCrunch </a>are:</p> \n<p><strong>Interest:</strong> This is a prediction Instagram makes about how interested you'll be in a particular post.</p> \n<p><strong>Frequency:</strong> How often you use the app that will determine what posts you see first when you open the app again.</p> \n<p><strong>Following:</strong> The more people you follow, the less likely you'll be able to see everyone in your news feed.</p> \n<p><strong>Recency:</strong> How recently was a post published? This impacts when you'll see a post in your news feed.</p> \n<p><strong>Relationship:</strong> Who shared the post and your connection to them will be a significant factor in how often you'll see their content. This is influenced by tagged photos, engagement, and even how often you direct message them.</p> \n<p><strong>Usage:</strong> The time you spend on Instagram affects the content you see as well.</p> \n<h3>What about the Reels, Shop, and Explore pages?</h3> \n<p>With the advent of Reels, Shop, and the Explore page, there are several opportunities for Instagram users to naturally affect the factors listed above by interacting with content outside of their news feeds. If you enjoy cooking videos, for example, you may see more of those types of videos and reels in your news feed.</p> \n<h3>Is Instagram removing likes?</h3> \n<p>We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the latest Instagram algorithm update in the works — <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-to-test-hiding-like-counts-in-us-wired25-2019-11\">removing likes</a>. Removing one of the most popular features of the app is being tested right now as a measure <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/instagram-hiding-likes-could-increase-post-volume.html\">against bullying and increased pressure </a>to post content that garners more and more social approval for young Instagrammers.</p> \n<p>The change has already taken effect in several countries including Canada, Brazil, and Australia. While it hasn't made its way to the United States in a widespread way yet, don't get too comfortable with your news feed engagement appearing for all to see. There could soon come a time when only you will see how many likes your posts receive.</p> \n<h2>It's All About Content Quality</h2> \n<p>The key takeaway for brands and individuals alike is this: Quality is Queen.</p> \n<p>These algorithms are meant to filter out irrelevant and poor-quality posts so that the highest-quality content gets through. Control over what users see and don't see is a collaboration between the social platform and the user. The user interacts with what they find interesting and the social media platform takes note and shows you more of that the next time you open the app.</p> \n<p>The big lesson for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram marketers like us is to remember that it's our job to post content to social that's interesting, entertaining, helpful, and/or relevant to our audiences. This means picking relevant topics, writing delightful copy, and posting compelling images and videos.</p> \n<p>By following these best practices, your posts will have a better chance of getting shown to users — so you can continue to inspire, delight, and educate them.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April 2016 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5fc2491c-cd3c-4adb-ad3c-b082ce2793d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5fc2491c-cd3c-4adb-ad3c-b082ce2793d3.png\"></a>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-algorithm-works-facebook-twitter-instagram&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3dc1dfd9-2cb4-4498-8c57-19dbb5671820.png","linkMd5":"4e0ef34fdf303eb776f27c1c1ade2030","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-07-683_ebc276d76ef14084.webp","destWidth":517,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6135,"destBytes":8328,"author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich Cox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3dc1dfd9-2cb4-4498-8c57-19dbb5671820.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-07-683_ebc276d76ef14084.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-1.png?width=400&name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn55@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-15-392_571f86f2692c7c72.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram.png?width=400&name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-823_ff4b33cb5cd29e9a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-3.png?width=400&name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn12@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-240_543d716fbd11d152.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-2.png?width=400&name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-14-964_b392d6db5d80038f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-4.png?width=400&name=How%20the%20News%20Feed%20Algorithms%20Work%20on%20Facebook,%20Twitter%20%26%20Instagram-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn79@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-885_d17207ec15986ff1.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5fc2491c-cd3c-4adb-ad3c-b082ce2793d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn7@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-15-046_73ab6e288063122a.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-algorithm-works-facebook-twitter-instagram&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-14-839_2daa8212ed829835.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087150},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"Why P2P Marketing Might Be a Good Alternative to Influencer Marketing","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/p2p-marketing","description":"<p>To understand what peer-to-peer (P2P) marketing is, let's start with an example.</p> \n<p>Recently, I was looking for a new face moisturizer. Of course, I <em>could've</em>&nbsp;trusted the numerous influencers I follow on Instagram, all with strong opinions regarding the \"best, most effective\"<em>&nbsp;</em>options available.</p> \n<p>But I wasn't convinced these influencers had my best interest in-mind. Yes, most influencers' (and micro-influencers) are successful because they promote valuable products. But they're getting commission off those posts, too.</p> \n<p>So I handled my problem the old-fashioned way — I texted my friends and asked what products they use.</p> \n<p>This isn't to say influencer marketing is ineffective. Quite the opposite: When done right, influencer marketing is a fantastic opportunity to expand your brand's reach and increase sales.</p> \n<p>But depending on your team's budget, influencer marketing could be limiting. Plus, influencer marketing inhibits your brand from reaching those consumers who still trust their peers above all else.</p> \n<p>Enter: P2P marketing.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Brand Building Guide\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Given <a href=\"https://www.marketingcharts.com/cross-media-and-traditional/word-of-mouth-113276\">93% of consumers trust friends and family</a>&nbsp;over all other influences (including review sites, blogs, and social media platforms), it makes sense why P2P marketing works.</p> \n<p>And P2P marketing, a form of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/how-online-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-changing\">word-of-mouth marketing</a>, isn't new. People have been giving personal opinions about their favorite — and least favorite — brands, products, and services long before social media.</p> \n<p>Some older forms of P2P marketing include Yelp, reviews on personal business' websites, and good old-fashioned conversations between your consumers and their friends and family.</p> \n<p>However, there are some new tools that help businesses leverage P2P marketing on a broader scale. <a href=\"https://amazingbrands.io/clients/\">Amazing Brands</a>, for instance, helps businesses generate customer reviews and referrals, guarantee event attendance, or even increase in-store foot traffic.</p> \n<p>The tool ultimately relies on the premise of P2P marketing, which is that there's nothing more powerful than peer recommendations.</p> \n<p>Other tools, like <a href=\"https://www.higherlogic.com/\">Higher Logic</a>, work to establish a sense of community among existing consumers, and increase brand loyalty — a critical component of P2P marketing. (Since consumers won't refer products or services towards which they don't feel loyal.)</p> \n<p>However, if you're learning about P2P marketing for the first time, you might be wondering — why invest in P2P marketing, instead of more traditional forms of influencer marketing?</p> \n<p>And what's the difference, anyway?&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What's the difference between P2P marketing and influencer marketing?</h3> \n<p>Over the past couple years, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\">influencer marketing has been one of the most popular</a> and effective opportunities for brands to reach new audiences by leveraging those influencers' built-in communities.</p> \n<p>However, as mentioned above, consumers still trust their own peers more than anyone else. And influencers can often feel like celebrities to the general public — in fact, sometimes, they <em>are </em>actual celebrities, like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\">George Clooney with Nespresso</a>. This removes a level of authenticity you might be striving for as a brand.</p> \n<p>Additionally, many small and medium-sized businesses can't afford the typical influencer cost. Celebrity or macro-influencers charge between <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/Sprout%20Social/hubspot-influencer-marketing-guide%20(1).pdf?__hstc=233546881.b08a0971055865ab76da45b879eff11f.1616195018855.1616195018855.1616195018855.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1616195018855&amp;__hsfp=3521948877#:~:text=To%20get%20a%20gauge%20on,%243%2C000%2D500%2C000%2B%20per%20post.\">$3,000 and $500,000 for a single post</a>&nbsp;— and while micro-influencers are undoubtedly cheaper, they can also charge upwards of <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/Sprout%20Social/hubspot-influencer-marketing-guide%20(1).pdf?__hstc=20629287.0c93a60d870574892216af66c4084de1.1565290736946.1570715862629.1570889361716.32&amp;__hssc=20629287.3.1570889361716&amp;__hsfp=1688475938#:~:text=To%20get%20a%20gauge%20on,%243%2C000%2D500%2C000%2B%20per%20post.\">$500 per post</a>.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Ultimately, P2P is a form of marketing that can feel increasingly trustworthy and authentic through real, genuine reviews from peers who have no incentive to promote businesses they don't care about. </span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>To further explore the difference between P2P marketing and influencer marketing, let's consider an example.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jessica Alba's business, The Honest Company, has a <a href=\"https://www.referwise.com/invite-friends-earn-20-with-honest-referral-program/\">referral program in which they credit existing customers $20</a> for each invited friend who makes a purchase.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is an example of P2P marketing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Influencer marketing, on the other hand, refers to the influencers on Instagram (as well as other social platforms) who <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/honestambassador/\">tag posts with #honestambassador</a>, signifying the post is sponsored by The Honest Company.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These are both equally valuable marketing options, but they achieve different goals. The P2P marketing initiative (in this case, the referral program), aims to tap into The Honest Company's existing consumers to reach new prospects.</p> \n<p>The P2P program is likely more narrow in reach, but has the potential to convert more quickly than influencer marketing, since it's leveraging the power of an existing relationship between customers and their friends or family.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The influencer marketing program, alternatively, is meant to spread brand awareness about Honest Company to a wider audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>P2P marketing can take many different forms depending on your brand and business goals — including creating a referral program, encouraging reviews on your site in exchange for a small discount or prize, or organizing events meant to increase brand awareness to the larger community.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, P2P marketing comes down to increasing the incentive for your consumers to share your product or service with friends and family, which is undoubtedly one of the best long-term strategies for success.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fp2p-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png","linkMd5":"53238816fd2a2fd09ddd186c47d41aaa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn67@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-07-749_eac7fa40866dc905.webp","destWidth":382,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4555,"destBytes":6088,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn67@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-07-749_eac7fa40866dc905.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn34@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-301_f4156d3bc1379fd0.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fp2p-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn52@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-15-334_a6931be2aa72280b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087174},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"Five Lessons I Learned About Scaling a Business With Reid Hoffman","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/mindset-of-scale-lessons","description":"<p>How great would it be if you had a panel of successful entrepreneurs and business leaders you could turn to whenever you needed help getting unstuck, or needed a daily dose of inspiration?</p>  \n<p>Fortunately, that's exactly what the new Masters of Scale Courses App offers — expert advice from some of the world's best and brightest minds, guided by Reid Hoffman.</p> \n<p>The first course is all about The Mindset of Scale. Here's what I learned from the first two lessons.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Business Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h3><strong>1. Ask \"Why not?\" and \"What if?\"</strong></h3> \n<p>Start by asking two important questions — \"Why not?\" and \"What if?\" — whenever you encounter something that makes you feel a strong emotion.</p> \n<p>For instance, think about the last time you experienced sticker shock or frustration over waiting in a long line. Those simple questions have sparked countless successful products and businesses — including Virgin Airlines. In his own words, here's Richard Branson:</p> \n<p>\"35 years ago, when we started [Virgin Airlines], the big carriers were dreadful. And<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through; color: #cccccc;\">&nbsp;</span>on one of those flights coming to the Virgin Islands, I got bumped, which is a sort of typical thing that airlines did in those days.\"</p> \n<p>Of course, being Richard Branson, he didn't pass the time by staring woefully at the departures board. Instead, he asked one of those powerful questions: <em>What if? What if he didn't have to wait for the next flight? What if he created a flight of his own?</em></p> \n<p>\"So I hired a plane and filled it up with all the people who had been bumped and called it Virgin Airlines as a joke. And we arrived in the BVI, and during that flight, I just thought, 'Airlines do bump people, maybe I should ring up Boeing the next day.' Which I did, and asked if they had any secondhand 747s for sale.\"</p> \n<p>As you can probably guess, they did, and Virgin Airways was born. Now, you may not be in the market for used 747 jets, but that doesn't mean these questions can't create similarly impactful results for you. So next time you find yourself feeling any powerful emotion, pause for a second, think about the situation, and ask yourself, \"What if?\"</p> \n<h3><strong>2. Have an idea, act on it, and never look back.</strong></h3> \n<p>Even though many people talk about the power of ideas, what the world actually rewards is action.</p> \n<p>Generating ideas is often the easy part — and with the right mindset, it's a process that can become second nature. But, what separates daydreaming from living your dream is taking action.</p> \n<p>Richard Branson has been an entrepreneur since he was 14 and launched his first business: a student magazine. After the magazine, he went on to found a record label, a video game publisher, and many other ventures — each one a product of taking action.</p> \n<p>If you're like me, even just reading that list of accomplishments sounds daunting. To overcome that feeling, Reid Hoffman offers this helpful advice: \"Next time you have an idea that you can't stop thinking about,<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through; color: #b7b7b7;\">&nbsp;</span>act on it immediately.\"</p> \n<p>After asking yourself \"Why not?\" or \"What if?\", identify the smallest or most immediate action you can do right now to act on your idea.</p> \n<p>By starting small and taking action right away, you can avoid the dreaded \"analysis paralysis\" and start building momentum towards your goal instead.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Need a big idea? Get intentional about looking for one.</strong></h3> \n<p>Before founding Spanx, Sarah Blakely was stuck in a dead-end job — making door-to-door fax machine sales were far from fulfilling. She knew she wasn't on the right path, but she just wasn't sure what that right path looked like.</p> \n<p>After a challenging day, she decided to try something different. In her journal, she wrote down, \"I want to invent a product that I can sell to millions of people that will make them feel good.\" According to Blakely, \"This was something that I set an intention for; I had really asked the universe to give me an idea that I could bring to the world.\"</p> \n<p>Blakely kept asking herself, \"Is this my big idea?\" until the answer was \"Yes.\"</p> \n<p>With her newfound intention, Blakely began finding the opportunities and ideas all around her. One night, after getting frustrated with her undergarment options, she cut the feet off of her pantyhose and discovered that her DIY solution was exactly what she was looking for — in more ways than one.</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Fill knowledge gaps with the people around you.</strong></h3> \n<p>After discovering her big idea for Spanx, Blakely faced a new challenge: How to build a business in an industry she knew almost nothing about. It wasn't an easy problem to solve, but Blakely wasn't about to let a lack of domain expertise get in her way.</p> \n<p>Instead, she started digging deeper. In the words of Reid Hoffman, \"She knew that to succeed, she had to be continually open to information and ideas — always in search of the insights and people who could help her turn her idea into a reality.\"</p> \n<p>It's okay not to know everything about your business, as long as you get help from people who can fill in your knowledge gaps. You'll go faster and further with the help of other people.</p> \n<p>Ask lots of questions to find your idea — and then keep asking them.</p> \n<h3><strong>5. Find a place or time where you do your best thinking, and set aside time to be in that space.</strong></h3> \n<p>Creating a successful business, launching a new product or campaign, or just keeping up with a highly demanding job all require a lot of decision-making. And good decision-making rests on a foundation of good thinking.</p> \n<p>According to Hoffman, \"Wherever, whenever and however, the point is this: an idea won't come looking for you, and it won't perfect itself. You have to put yourself in spaces and places and frames of mind, where you can find and shape the idea.\"</p> \n<p>For more lessons about scale, download the Masters of Scale Courses app for 50% using the code <span style=\"color: #222222;\">HUBSPOT at</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://account.mastersofscale.com/membership?utm_source=Hubspot&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=HUBSPOT\">join.mastersoscale.com/hubstpot</a>. <em>Offer is valid through 5/15/21.</em>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9ce704de-19f2-4fd0-8041-22dc3c021b87&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Business Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9ce704de-19f2-4fd0-8041-22dc3c021b87.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmindset-of-scale-lessons&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa.png","linkMd5":"423135fd2946c04628076715ab28526f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-07-771_8ff1ce58a24f6d9c.webp","destWidth":428,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4856,"destBytes":6606,"author":"acollins@hubspot.com (Alicia Collins)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-07-771_8ff1ce58a24f6d9c.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9ce704de-19f2-4fd0-8041-22dc3c021b87.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn92@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-14-653_ec9e2c896a128892.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmindset-of-scale-lessons&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn43@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-15-218_66180e35b03d2184.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087144},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"7 Tips for Designing a Social Media Page That Stands Out","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-design","description":"<p>At least once a month, I discover a new brand and take a quick peek at their profile.

This is why social media design is an instrumental part of your social strategy. So much of social media is about perception and design plays a big role in determining that.</p> \n<p>How can you make sure your design attracts the right audience? We'll cover that and more below.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, social platforms are often the first place consumers discover brands. As such, making a great first impression is the first step to building a robust <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog/tabid/6307/bid/4663/how-to-monitor-your-social-media-presence-in-10-minutes-a-day.aspx\">social media presence</a>.</p> \n<p>Your social media design will also impact your brand perception. Every post you create and publish tells a story and contributes to your brand image. You want to make sure that story aligns with your overall messaging and builds a connection with your audience.</p> \n<p>This is particularly important on platforms that prioritize visuals, like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-for-business-guide\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tiktok-for-business\">TikTok</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing\">Facebook</a>. But you'll still need to make sure your designs are consistent on all platforms.</p> \n<h2>What to Consider For Social Media Post Designs</h2> \n<p>Before you start working on your design, you'll want to consider a few things. The first is your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\">brand identity</a> – your social media platform will be the visual representation of it, so you and your team must have a clear idea of what it is.</p> \n<p>The next step is conducting <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\">market research </a>to understand your audience. Questions to answer include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What are they looking for in a brand?</li> \n <li>What are their values?</li> \n <li>What are they interested in?</li> \n <li>What are they concerned about?</li> \n <li>What do they like to see on social media? What do they like to see on X platform?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>This will serve as your frame of reference to drive your design approach.</p> \n<p>You'll then want to look at your competition's designs. While you have your unique approach, it's useful to know what visual strategies they're using and how consumers are responding. The more information you have, the better equipped you will be to design creative assets that resonate with your audience.</p> \n<h2>Tips For Designing Social Media Posts</h2> \n<h3>1. Aim for consistency and cohesion.</h3> \n<p>Consistency is key when designing your social media page. Why? Because it helps with brand recognition.</p> \n<p>Imagine if every time you saw a brand, they changed their brand colors and logo. You would probably confuse it for another brand or forget it altogether. Brand recognition is important for building trust and loyalty with your audience.</p> \n<p>Beyond posting regularly, consistency on social media also means sticking to a visual theme. Is it dark and moody or light and airy? Do you want your page to evoke calm, excitement, balance, focus, or something else?</p> \n<p>Whatever your answers are to those questions should be reflected in a cohesive design. One way to do this is by using the same filter or editing style on all of your images to ensure they all fit within your branding.</p> \n<h3>2. Use colors to mirror your brand identity.</h3> \n<p>It's no surprise that colors affect how consumers perceive your brand. That's why popular food brands are usually associated with the colors red and yellow, and financial institutions with blues.</p> \n<p>There are a few ways to incorporate color into your social media design. The first is in your templates. If you plan to use templates when posting graphics, you'll want to incorporate your colors to increase your brand recognition.</p> \n<p>For your images and videos, you can also highlight certain colors to stand out.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Urban Skin instagram page\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media.png?width=250&amp;name=8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com/urbanskinrx\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>In the example above, Urban Skin consistently uses two main colors in its design: peach and turquoise. While they may have other colors in their images, these two are always front and center.</p> \n<p>Another strategy is designing your social media posts to align with a particular theme and color. For instance, let's say you're a fashion brand and you're planning February content. Given the association of February with Valentine's Day and the color red, you could build your creative assets around that theme for the month.</p> \n<h3>3. Use social media design templates.</h3> \n<p>If you want to scale your social media strategy, you'll likely need to have templates.</p> \n<p>They're a huge time saver and ensure consistent branding. Platforms like <a href=\"http://canva.com\">Canva</a> make it easy for teams to create and share templates that have been approved by the branding team and align with your strategy. Jump to that section [here].</p> \n<p>Be sure to have a diverse set of templates that can be used for various content types, such as infographics and videos. For instance, this brand <a href=\"https://mateonewyork.com/\">Mateo New York</a> likely uses templates that produce a sleek and attractive layout that stays consistent.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Mateo New York instagram design \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com/mateonewyork\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>4. Adapt your design to the platform.</h3> \n<p>Every platform has different sizing and content guidelines.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-reels\">Instagram Reels</a> are formatted to be viewed on smartphones, which means videos must be filmed in portrait orientation. Facebook, on the other hand, is formatted for landscape videos – similar to YouTube.</p> \n<p>For videos in particular, you want to avoid having content with black sidebars, as that isn't visually appealing.</p> \n<p>Beyond sizing, you also have to consider which platforms are appropriate for certain designs. For instance, an infographic probably wouldn't do well on Twitter. Breaking that content down into a text thread is a better strategy.</p> \n<p>Following these guidelines will make your content more likely to perform well.</p> \n<h3>5. Follow design best practices.</h3> \n<p>The main goal of your social media design is to create visually appealing content that captures your audience's attention and encourages them to engage.</p> \n<p>While several factors influence this, there are general design rules that are known to create appealing visuals. The first is white or negative space, which is when an area in your frame is left empty. Using white or negative space helps draw the eye to what you want your audience to focus on.</p> \n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://assets.pinterest.com/ext/embed.html?id=459226493254000644\" width=\"345\" height=\"618\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.yvonnekone.com/\">Yvonne Koné </a>uses white space in its social media design, which reflects the brand's simplistic and minimalist identity.</p> \n<p>Here are a few other <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design\">design principles</a> you'll want to consider when developing your creative assets:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Hierarchy </strong>– Arranging your visual elements by order of importance. You can do this by playing around with sizing, contrast, space, and other elements.</li> \n <li><strong>Balance </strong>– Having equal visual weight in an image, which creates harmony, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LonezScents/status/1333518401894043652/photo/1\">in this example</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>Contrast </strong>– Putting elements with opposite colors, sizes, or textures to make them stand out.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. Don't forget about your profile.</h3> \n<p>While the main focus will be on your social media posts, don't forget to design your social profiles.</p> \n<p>Your profile picture, cover photo, and other visual elements should be a top priority when designing your social media. Here are some tips to follow:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Be sure to use the same profile picture, i.e. your logo, on all social platforms.</li> \n <li>Use a cover photo that aligns both visually and contextually with your brand.</li> \n <li>Only update your profile to highlight events or holidays that are important to your brand. For instance, some brands add a rainbow pride flag to their logo in June in solidarity with the LGBTQ community.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>7. Rely on creative professionals.</h3> \n<p>Your social media design will only be as good as your investment.</p> \n<p>When it comes to images and illustrations, it's worth consulting professionals who specialize in creating high-quality content. They can guide you through the creative process and make suggestions that will elevate your design.</p> \n<p>If your team cannot invest in a full-time creative, consider independent contractors. With this approach, you can work on a project-by-project basis and experiment with different designers.</p> \n<h2>How To Find Social Media Design Templates</h2> \n<p>If your team wants an easy way to source templates, there's a cost-effective way to do so without sacrificing quality. Many online branding companies offer customizable templates that have been designed by professionals. Here are a few to consider:</p> \n<h3>1. Canva</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a> is a graphic design platform with over 250,000 free templates available for personal and commercial use.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Canva homepage\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media-2.png?width=600&amp;name=8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<p>In addition to templates, Canva also has an extensive stock library with photos, animations, and videos for brands in any industry. The platform is free for individual users and has professional and enterprise options for larger companies, with pricing going up to $30/month.</p> \n<h3>2. Lucidpress</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/\">Lucidpress</a> is a brand templating platform that makes it easy to create everything from social media posts to ebooks.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Lucidpress homepage\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>The platform is free to start using. To gain access to unlimited templates, pricing starts at $10 a month and can go up depending on your business needs.</p> \n<p>Your branding doesn't stop at your logo or website. It also extends to your social media. By investing time to develop a brand-specific social media design, you will get one step closer to connecting with your target audience.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=238172ff-4491-41bb-bb91-b0ab872786f6&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"social Media images\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/238172ff-4491-41bb-bb91-b0ab872786f6.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsocial-media-design&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6b90aadb-dd8c-4687-89a3-c245110c6a91.png","linkMd5":"0b473780ca7e645ade3efeff18519caf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn36@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-07-602_07c7c97591490c80.webp","destWidth":520,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5823,"destBytes":8120,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6b90aadb-dd8c-4687-89a3-c245110c6a91.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn36@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-07-602_07c7c97591490c80.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media.png?width=250&name=8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn22@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-14-567_48e75de69da4d447.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media.jpeg?width=250&name=8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn80@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-14-173_8e80e5aa85e444d4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media-2.png?width=600&name=8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn60@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-15-288_6bf028c13712868a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/8%20Tips%20for%20Designing%20Your%20Social%20Media-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn61@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-14-960_9a9bc115f0ffd67a.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/238172ff-4491-41bb-bb91-b0ab872786f6.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-14-917_813a347d4ace6977.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsocial-media-design&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn83@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-14-231_2c7763781fc0ba47.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087173},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"Paid Social Media: Worth The Investment?","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/paid-social-media","description":"<p>Social media advertising spend is expected to top <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246341/social-media-advertising-spending-in-the-us/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20social%20media%20advertising,spending%20forecast%20for%20that%20year.\">$47.9 billion in 2021</a>.

The advantage to paying for this type of value? Speed to market, campaign sustainability, and good old fashioned message frequency.</p> \n<p>Organic social media traffic can take days to build due to the algorithms at work behind the scenes of the most popular social media sites. If you’re running a short campaign, that ramp up time can cost you visibility and leads. With paid social media, your campaign can get started with an extra boost at a speed that organic posts just can’t match. In addition to sustaining views, traffic, and engagement for as long as your credit card can stand, you’ll have the benefit of retargeting consumers with your ads to achieve an <a href=\"https://www.jonloomer.com/facebook-ad-frequency/\">advertisement frequency that you can control</a>.</p> \n<p>In this article, we’ll discuss what paid social media is, the components of a paid social media strategy, and the top social media platforms for running paid ads.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Access Now: Free Media Planning Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Pay-per-click advertising, branded or influencer-generated content, and display ads are all examples of paid social media. You’ll know a paid social media advertisement when you see one based on the “sponsored” or “promoted” tag near the post.</p> \n<p>Every social media channel is different. Twitter offers short-form content, Instagram focuses heavily on visual content, Facebook has its own marketplace for shopping enthusiasts, and LinkedIn is the home of networking professionals.</p> \n<p>As such, paid social media on each platform differs, and should, depending on the campaign and audience.</p> \n<p>Here, we're going to explore some quick strategies that will help you decide how to use paid social to the benefit of your brand.</p> \n<p>Having a paid social media strategy can optimize a marketing budget that might not be substantial enough to promote a large brand through traditional media channels. If your business is working with a limited budget to reach hefty ROI goals, look no further. We've gathered the important things you’ll need to know about using paid social media ads.</p> \n<p>To create a paid social media strategy, you’ll want to start with two critical items: An objective and a budget.</p> \n<h3>Paid Social Media Strategy Objective</h3> \n<p>Setting the objective for your paid social media strategy gives your subsequent tactics a direction to work with and a goal to achieve. Think of this strategy as a road trip. You start your journey at your house with the goal of making it to your destination by a certain time. Paid social ads work the same way — your audience is starting their journey with your brand on their newsfeed and your goal is to lead them to the destination — a content offer on your website, an email subscription form, or even your social media profile itself.</p> \n<p>To establish where your audience is starting their journey, you’ll use filters, settings, and other criteria to narrow down your audience so that everyone you target is starting from a similar place. This doesn’t have to be a physical location (although it can be). You can target people by their age, their hobbies, and even their occupation.</p> \n<p>Once you have your starting point, it’s time to define your destination. Different social media ad platforms have their own conversion tools, but the end goal is almost always the same — get people to share their contact information with your business. You might do this with a form fill or a visit to a landing page on your website. Either one works to reach the destination, but <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/14/facebook-lead-ads-vs-landing-pages\">depending on your business’s needs</a>, you might prefer one or the other.</p> \n<h3>Paid Social Media Strategy Budget</h3> \n<p>Paid social media advertising is one of the least expensive types of advertising available in the traditional and digital market. The pay-to-play model for these channels makes them flexible enough to target only the people your business wants to attract, therefore you only have to pay for those you have the ability to reach.</p> \n<p>Unlike TV or radio ads that are priced based on the length of the spot and the time the ads will air, social media ads are priced based on the length of the campaign and the potential number of impressions you'll be working toward with your ads. This gives these types of ads a much more favorable KPI to track — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cost-per-acquisition\">cost per acquisition</a> — as opposed to traditional ads that can only vaguely track cost per million impressions.</p> \n<p>Paid social media ads can start as low as $1 because of the bidding model and lottery system some platforms use to bring ads onto users’ newsfeeds. Spending for this type of advertising is virtually unlimited, but you can set a limit that will stop the campaign from spending more money than you’ve allowed.</p> \n<p>You’ll need to keep an eye on your credit card balance as you reach the spending limit you’ve set as these campaigns are programmed to stop running when the money runs out. That might sound helpful, but it can be annoying at best and detrimental to your campaign at worst. If you’re running a large campaign that needs a budget that exceeds the limit of your credit card, even just a few hours of downtime to pay the balance down can mean lost leads and momentum for your campaign. If your credit card needs to be paid in full each day due to a high spending limit you’ve set for the ad campaign, a lucky person or people on your team will have the honor of creating several expense reports for the duration of the campaign.</p> \n<p>To avoid this problem, consider raising the balance on your business credit card so that you have plenty of time to pay it off before the ads max it out, or try setting a lower daily spending limit for your campaign.</p> \n<p>Each paid social media platform has unique features that set it apart from competitors. However, there are three key characteristics of a converting paid ad that you’ll want your platform of choice to support: visual content, easy access to lead capture forms, and enough space to include enticing ad copy.</p> \n<h3>Facebook</h3> \n<p>When advertising on Facebook, it's a good idea to use <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/ad-targeting\">Facebook Targeted Ads</a>. It’s the most robust ad platform available by far and that’s not for nothing. This feature is run on a <a href=\"https://medium.com/social-media-tips/how-does-facebook-ads-bidding-work-and-how-much-do-ads-cost-e8dab524d7b0\">bidding system</a> — a type of advertising buying process where advertisers bid on a number of ads based on their preferred target audience. Then, that bid will be put into a lottery for a chance to be picked and displayed to that audience. Facebook ads can narrow an audience down to just a few hundred people based on geography, interests, demographics, and more. And while that may not be beneficial for most large corporations, it can be the difference between a slow month and a sold out day for a small business.</p> \n<p>Other than the lottery, Facebook Ads lets you show advertisements to your customers based on their behavior. This is helpful because you can keep advertising to your existing Facebook customers based on what Facebook tells you about their use of the app.</p> \n<p>Using Facebook Ads helps you build new leads and generate brand awareness. Facebook provides reports and analytics that are perfect for experimenting with variables like post time and content type, so try using different ad formats and see what your audience engages with most.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Facebook Ad Example: <a href=\"http://networkforgood.com\">Network for Good</a></p> \n<p><img alt=\"Network for Good facebook ad on peer to peer fundraising checklist\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-1.png?width=650&amp;name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://networkforgood.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Network for Good has a strong paid social media strategy and has for a few years. As a servant leader in several nonprofit organizations, I’m targeted often with their checklists, templates, and guides on Facebook. Here’s why this ad works:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li><strong>It keeps users on the platform.</strong> When a user clicks through to download the checklist, they’re not redirected to an external website. Facebook offers businesses the option for in-app form fills (that's a lot of words to say that users remain on Facebook while they convert on the ad.) That means the user doesn’t experience much disruption when they interact with the ad and can finish their Facebook session as soon as they’re done downloading the checklist.</li> \n <li><strong>There’s a prompt to drive conversation.</strong> There’s no question about what this ad wants me to do — download the Peer-to-Peer Fundraising Checklist. Simple, clear copy like this makes it easy for the user to convert on this ad because they don’t have to think about what their next step should be. They can either keep scrolling or download.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>For more information about running your own Facebook Ads that can convert just like this one, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-paid-ad-checklist?_ga=2.225195290.121387002.1580754077-940436819.1565181751\">check out this checklist</a> for lesser-known tips about running successful ad campaigns on this platform.</p> \n<h3>Twitter</h3> \n<p>As a consumer, paid ads on Twitter tend to sneak up on me. I barely know I'm looking at a sponsored tweet because they look so similar to regular tweets. As a marketer, this is fantastic news; it means more eyes on your ads because they're not as blatant as ads on other social channels.</p> \n<p>Why Twitter Ads? Well, Twitter reports having <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/970920/monetizable-daily-active-twitter-users-worldwide/\">192 million monetizable daily users</a> (the number of people who can see your ad on any given day), and when using their Ad software, you can target your ad to a specific demographic.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Twitter Ad Example: <a href=\"https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/\">The Penny Hoarder</a></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment_-4.jpg?width=450&amp;name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment_-4.jpg\" alt=\"The Penny Hoarder twitter ad featuring an image of a tennessee welcome sign\" width=\"450\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://partners.thepennyhoarder.com/9-money-moves-every-tennessean-needs-to-make-this-week/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>As a Tennessee native, The Penny Hoarder can deduce that I might like seeing imagery and copy about my home state. <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-setup/campaign-targeting/geo-gender-and-language-targeting.html\">Geographically targeted ads</a> can be successful for businesses in a broad market category — like The Penny Hoarder. Financial advice is applicable to anyone anywhere, but by positioning the content in a way that affects my life, I felt intrigued to click on the ad and learn more. Here’s why else this ad works:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>It brings more traffic to this blog article.</strong> The <a href=\"https://partners.thepennyhoarder.com/9-money-moves-every-tennessean-needs-to-make-this-week/\">original article</a> was published in August 2020, but the continuous advertising on Twitter brings in more views than it might receive organically. Unlike Facebook, which has devised ways to <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-algorithm/\">keep people on the site longer</a>, Twitter allows users to visit the Penny Hoarder Website and read the article with just one click.</li> \n <li><strong>It’s visually appealing. </strong>Geography is just one way to evoke emotions and resonate with consumers in an ad. By framing this ad (and the article it’s promoting) with an identifier like Tennessee, people who live in the area or are from the area will instantly say “this has to do with me and my community — I need to care.”</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Twitter provides ad settings based on your budget —like how frequently your ad will be seen, where it will be seen, and the ad type to run. When you’re ready to run your social ads on this platform, Twitter offers <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-set-up-twitter-ads-campaigns\">different formats</a> for you to choose from based on your goals.</p> \n<h3>Instagram</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/\">84% of people discover new products on Instagram</a> — up from 64% just four years ago. With growth like this, it probably isn't a bad idea to pay for a spot in front of the <a href=\"https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-october-global-statshot\">1.16 billion accounts</a> in the platform’s advertising reach.</p> \n<p>To run ads on Instagram, you’ll need a business profile — this allows you to set up an ecommerce store right on the app. (That’s a plus if you don’t have a website prepared to accept payments or if you’re testing out ecommerce for the first time.)</p> \n<p>Since Facebook owns Instagram, you’ll be running ads concurrently on both platforms and they're all managed on Facebook.</p> \n<p>Using Instagram Ads, you can choose an amount of ad spend that works for your budget starting as low as $1. This amount is tied to the timeline of the campaign and the size of your audience.</p> \n<p>I compare Instagram ads to filling up a gas tank — you get the amount of gas you pay for. On Instagram, your ad campaign runs during the amount of time you pay for.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Instagram Ad Example: <a href=\"https://www.aveeno.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=GO-USA-ENG-PS-Aveeno-BC-BM-RN-Masterbrand-Core&amp;utm_content=Brand-General&amp;utm_term=%2Baveeno&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwi7yCBhDJARIsAMWFScPDbXnnTLzNzD2AUJMauJXgLIdFtfzzOK6df_aEpUV1ZGNZM9aofuEaAgLtEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;\">Aveeno</a></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/aveeno-min-1.png?width=450&amp;name=aveeno-min-1.png\" alt=\"Aveeno helathy looking skin ad with a bottle of aveeno lotion\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"> <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-ads\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Aveeno utilized Instagram's ad platform to target consumers with their product. The simple design is eye-catching without becoming overwhelming and distracting. Here's why it works:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>It's visually appealing.</strong> The neutral colors and clean design draws our eyes to the product. (The pointing hand is a bonus that keeps our eye on the CTA — the shopping cart!)</li> \n <li><strong>The call to action is simple.</strong> One of the great features of Instagram ads is the ability to swipe up to see more about the product or make a purchase. When you're done, it's easy to close out of the Aveeno website and continue consuming other Instagram content.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>LinkedIn</h3> \n<p>On LinkedIn, millions of professionals have found a wealth of professional connections, their dream job, or both. The platform lets you reach thousands of people in your industry including thought leaders, hiring managers, and decision-makers.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, as a marketer, LinkedIn’s paid ads let you reach those same individuals on behalf of your business.</p> \n<p>There are 740 million professionals on LinkedIn, and <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ad-targeting\">four out of five</a> of them drive business decisions —like business purchase decisions. This is a B2B advertiser's dream come true. With the potential to reach 60 million decision-makers on the <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/audience\">most popular social platform for lead generation</a>, it's good to consider LinkedIn as an optimal platform for B2B advertising.</p> \n<img alt=\"Example of LinkedIn Ads settings\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F.png?width=650&amp;name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-size: 12px;\" href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-ads-guide/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">LinkedIn's targeted ads let you type in keywords and select audiences by category. So, if you're posting a job for a certain role, LinkedIn can help you find a pool of diverse candidates with relevant experience.</p> \n<p><strong>LinkedIn Ad Example:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.on24.com/\">ON24</a></p> \n<p><img alt=\"On24 LinkedIn ad about a webinar on the topic of the evolution of the buyers journey\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-2.png?width=650&amp;name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/on24\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>On24 uses short and sweet copy to start a dialogue with its target audience. By focusing on business use cases for its product, the ON24 can position itself as a thought leader on the topic of buyer journeys to entice LinkedIn users to register for the event. Here’s why it works:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li><strong>It keeps users on the platform.</strong> Similar to Facebook, LinkedIn uses in-app form fills to make the exchange between businesses and LinkedIn users who register for the event. That way, after they’re done registering, they can continue seeking their next opportunity, networking, or engaging with other content creators.</li> \n <li><strong>There’s a prompt to drive the conversation.</strong> No matter how much money you spend on ads, there isn’t a way to buy engagement on those ads. Comments, likes, and shares still need to come organically which means the captions, copy, and headlines you choose for your ads should make the most of the limited space available. ON24 does a great job of this by asking a question that everyone has an answer to in the caption of this promoted post.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>You can also play around with ad formats on LinkedIn to find which one is most effective. To find out more about the ad types on LinkedIn —such as sponsored, message, text, and dynamic — check out our post about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-advertising-campaigns?_ga=2.191445162.121387002.1580754077-940436819.1565181751\">creating an awesome LinkedIn Ad campaign</a>.</p> \n<h2>Scaling Your Paid Social Media Strategy</h2> \n<p>When you put money behind a campaign, no matter how much or how little, you’ll want a sustainable ROI that shows the budget, effort, and resources you expended were all worth it. That ROI growth means you’ll be able to scale your campaigns in the future, and paid ads can fuel your success.</p> \n<p>Now that you have a solid understanding of the most popular paid social media ad platforms on the market, you’ll need to track all of your hard work to realize that ROI. The native platforms we mentioned earlier do offer reporting and analytics, but what happens when you run a campaign across several different social media sites? I’ll give you a hint — it gets very messy very quickly.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"HubSpot's free ad tracking software\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-3.png?width=650&amp;name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ads?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/paid-social-media&amp;hubs_post-cta=HubSpot%E2%80%99s%20free%20ad%20tracking%20software%20\">HubSpot’s free ad tracking software </a>gives you one hub in which to manage all of your social media paid ads. That means you can report the success of your campaigns in just a few clicks rather than spending an entire day hunting down the information in each native platform. You’ll also have one source of truth for the combined total impressions, reach, and clicks. That’s paid social media at scale.</p> \n<h2>Investing in paid social media — the verdict is in.</h2> \n<p>It's easy to think ad spend is just for the big brands, but making informed purchase decisions benefits every business.</p> \n<p>The truth is, social media channels are making advertising accessible to large and small businesses alike. Once you learn how to plan, create, and position your ads to your target audience, you’ll have a much smoother time proving the ad campaign’s ROI to your stakeholders.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in February 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=42d905a8-656c-41d8-8c20-b93c7c9c5a12&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"paid media template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/42d905a8-656c-41d8-8c20-b93c7c9c5a12.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpaid-social-media&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e.png","linkMd5":"da4049ddc76d532c6714bc87ffc27dcf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn64@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-07-798_dd5e75e818f84a1f.webp","destWidth":389,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4641,"destBytes":6192,"author":"bcoleman@hubspot.com (Basha Coleman)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn64@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-07-798_dd5e75e818f84a1f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-1.png?width=650&name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn91@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-240_251e7a952c17c8b1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment_-4.jpg?width=450&name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment_-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn8@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-15-521_a7e513d60224072d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/aveeno-min-1.png?width=450&name=aveeno-min-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn88@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-15-016_ea4c9d2e241a7eb4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F.png?width=650&name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-14-693_9a39a4f247ccb67c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-2.png?width=650&name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn88@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-14-335_3c1a6af2352bf049.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-3.png?width=650&name=Paid%20Social%20Media%20Worth%20The%20Investment%3F-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-15-473_feae75ff9db8350b.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/42d905a8-656c-41d8-8c20-b93c7c9c5a12.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-14-238_b0fecfde2c648704.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpaid-social-media&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn79@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-15-553_678baecaef1def17.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087141},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"10 Benefits of Consistent, High-Quality Content Marketing","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/benefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand","description":"<p>In this competitive B2B marketing landscape, businesses make substantial investments in building content marketing programs.</p> \n<p>Why? Content marketing has been proven to deliver resounding success.</p>  \n<p>As one of the most effective methods of growing audience engagement, developing your brand presence, and driving sales, content marketing is a mission-critical growth method for most businesses.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review content marketing — the benefits of producing consistent, high-quality content, and how to measure success.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=2000ba0b-ea58-45a5-ac81-3b463d992c1a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Content Marketing Mapping Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2000ba0b-ea58-45a5-ac81-3b463d992c1a.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>According to the State of Inbound report, content creation is a<a href=\"https://www.stateofinbound.com/?__hstc=20629287.84e04411a062bd71ea6e407b66fb20f0.1607454300758.1616014513645.1616031476958.281&amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1616031476958&amp;__hsfp=3109495322\"> top priority for 53% of marketers.</a> Moreover, on average, content marketing accounts for<a href=\"https://www.pointvisible.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics-and-trends-2017/\"> 29% of B2B marketing budgets</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n Consistent, high-quality, and engaging content impacts audience decision-making more than any other technique.\n</blockquote> \n<p>Consistency in brand messaging is one of the many factors that determine the growth and success of your business. Big brands know how to portray their brand consistently and at every <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-touchpoints\">customer touchpoint</a>.</p> \n<p>The same reasoning applies to content marketing — your content needs to carry a unique and identifiable voice, style, and pitch across all distribution channels.</p> \n<p>Content consistency establishes your credibility, builds trust, and strengthens your reputation.</p> \n<p>So, we know the content you create has to be consistent. However, why is content marketing so beneficial in the first place? Here are the top benefits of content marketing.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of Content Marketing</h2> \n<h3>1. Your audience will stick around longer.</h3> \n<p>Great content is an important asset. It has the ability to create positive experiences for your potential customers and compel them to come back for more. It's your ticket to capturing your audience's attention and continually reinforcing a positive brand impression.</p> \n<h3>2. You'll have better traction on social media.</h3> \n<p>It's one thing to increase your social media followers across channels, but it's quite another to create trendy content. If you're one of those businesses that doesn't see much traction despite having a huge following, it's time to use content marketing to your advantage. Quality content can help your business gain traction on social media.</p> \n<p>Track the performance of your content campaigns using <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/benefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand&amp;hubs_post-cta=HubSpot%E2%80%99s%20analytics%20software\">HubSpot's analytics software</a>.</p> \n<h3>3. Your audience will trust you.</h3> \n<p>Creating content helps your business build a relationship with your audience. You can answer their questions and interact with customers. When you create value without taking anything in return, your audience is more likely to trust your advice and recommendations.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, when your content shows up at the right place and the right time with the right audience, it'll improve your brand's reputation.The more quality content customers see, the more likely they are to have a positive association with your company.</p> \n<h3>4. You'll generate more and better leads.</h3> \n<p>Content marketing can also generate leads. When your audience views your content, they're more likely to purchase from you in the future. Additionally, calls-to-action (CTA) placed directly in your content can generate new leads for your sales team.</p> \n<p>So, how can content generate leads?</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht\">Lindsay Kolowich</a>, the team manager of the HubSpot Academy Acquisition Content Team, \"content is a great way to guide users to a landing page. Typically, you create content to provide visitors with useful, free information. You can include CTAs anywhere in your content — inline, bottom-of-post, in the hero, or even on the side panel. The more delighted a visitor is with your content, the more likely they are to click your call-to-action and move onto your landing page.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Original content can improve conversions.</h3> \n<p>The content you post influences conversions. It helps your audience connect with you and gives them information needed to make educated purchases.</p> \n<p>Even more, if you're using blog content to bring in traffic, consider using <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/blogging-statistics/\">unique images rather than stock photos</a> for a potential 35% increase in conversions.</p> \n<p>Additionally, your content should always include a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples\">CTA</a> and guide your reader on what they should do next.</p> \n<h3>6. Your business will become more visible thanks to SEO.</h3> \n<p>The more consistent, high-quality content you produce, the better it'll be for your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-strategy\">SEO efforts</a>.</p> \n<p>For example, your content should help your business become visible online and build trust and authority with your audience. With a developed content strategy, such as the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-cluster-model-transform-blog\">pillar/cluster model</a>, your content should help you rank higher in search engines.</p> \n<h3>7. Great content can position your company as an authority in your industry.</h3> \n<p>Creating quality content will also help build your authority online. If your business is established as a credible place to get information, you're more likely to rank higher in search engines.</p> \n<p>Plus, your customers are more inclined to trust you if they view you as an industry expert. Your content should demonstrate your expertise in your field and provide valuable answers to your audience's questions.</p> \n<p>Overall, content marketing is important. But, how can you be successful at it?</p> \n<p>One way to tell is to assess the quality of your content. One particularly beneficial assessment of quality is content scoring.</p> \n<p>As more businesses are <a href=\"https://www.brafton.com/blog/content-marketing/the-2020-state-of-content-marketing-report/#:~:text=Nearly%2050%25%20of%20B2B%20marketers,with%201%2D99%20employees%3A%20%24111%2C000\">increasing their content marketing budget</a>, there's never been a better time to incorporate content scoring metrics into your marketing campaign.</p> \n<p>With the help of content scoring, you can measure and improve your content marketing performance and offer great value to your audience.</p> \n<h3>8. Quality content can build brand awareness.</h3> \n<p>Sure, anything can build brand awareness, but content marketing can do it in a unique way.</p> \n<p>Our HubSpot marketing experts have written about something called <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/surround-sound-strategy-1\">Surround Sound strategy</a>.</p> \n<p>In a nutshell, this content strategy does more than just rank your blog article on page one. It makes your content (and therefore your brand) appear everywhere your potential customers are looking for your product.</p> \n<p>To execute this strategy, write about topics your customers are interested in so they begin to associate your great content with your brand.</p> \n<h3>9. You'll cultivate loyal brand fans.</h3> \n<p>Taking brand awareness a step further, all the people who raved about your content and associated all those great feelings to your brand are very likely to become brand advocates before ever purchasing your product.</p> \n<p>Wait, what?</p> \n<p>It's true, brand fans can be just as <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/customers-who-dont-convert/\">loyal and influence their friends' and family's buying decisions</a> as much as a current customer can. This happens when potential consumers see that a business provides value to its current audience. One of the more successful ways businesses can do this is through content marketing.</p> \n<p>For example, while I may not be in the market for children's meal plans because I don't have children yet, I am obsessed with the <a href=\"https://kidseatincolor.com/\">Kids Eat In Color</a> blog and Instagram content. I recommend it to my friends and family who have children with picky eating habits. See how well that can work?</p> \n<h3>10. You'll save money on your marketing strategy.</h3> \n<p>Since HubSpot <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/10172/inbound-leads-cost-62-less-than-outbound-new-data.aspx\">first assessed the cost of content marketing</a> ten years ago, the practice has remained the <a href=\"https://caliston.co.uk/blog/internet-marketing/5-cost-effective-marketing-strategies-for-2021\">most cost-effective marketing strategy</a> available.</p> \n<p>Upfront costs for content appear steep, and that's a fair point.</p> \n<p>Estimates for blog content range from $150 a post to $3,000 for a freelance writer, but you could go the route of hiring a full-time staff writer to create content for you on a regular basis.</p> \n<p>In the long term, when compared to paid advertisements, video marketing, and traditional marketing, content wins the battle with Frank from finance every time.</p> \n<h2>What is content scoring?</h2> \n<p>Content scoring is the process of assessing and quantifying the true potential of content by tracking how individual content pieces perform in generating and converting leads.</p> \n<p>As an innovative content marketing metric, content scoring helps marketers prioritize only the assets that have a higher probability of generating and converting leads.</p> \n<p>In addition to delivering a scientific method of assessment to writing, content scoring is a reliable and predictive method of evaluating the engagement potential of an individual piece of content before it's published.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\">Improving the quality of your content</a> is pivotal to the success of your marketing campaigns.</p> \n<p>The quality of your content is relative to your audience's profile. With a better understanding of your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-needs\">customer's needs</a>, you can offer content with higher resonance. But improving your content is a gradual process, and you need to continually measure and analyze your audience's responses to understand and improve on the elements that matter most.</p> \n<h2>How to Score Your Content</h2> \n<p>Writers and content creators often find it difficult to quantify what recipe works for their content and their audience. By scoring your content, you're able to objectify that process and use the same recipe repeatedly to create similarly successful content.</p> \n<p>Here's how to score your content:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Establish scoring criteria. To develop an effective content scoring system, you need to establish a foundation built on whichever engagement metric has the greatest impact on your content. For some, it may be page views, for others it could be shares on social media.</li> \n <li>Create a campaign. Once you've identified which metric matters to you most, create a campaign and add the successful content that meets your threshold. For example, if you decide that 1,000 page views is high performing, include all the content assets that meet said criteria.</li> \n <li>Monitor content performance. Measure how each new piece of content you create is performing. As certain content assets meet your success metric — 1,000 page views, for example — add them to the campaign. Continue adding content to build a small sample size of high-performing content. Use <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/benefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand&amp;hubs_post-cta=HubSpot%20Analytics\">HubSpot Analytics</a> to track the performance of this content.</li> \n <li>Evaluate what works. Now that your high-performing content is segregated, you can further analyze what makes your content perform. Although it's difficult to quantify, you can discover patterns within your content that you can then replicate.</li> \n <li>Rinse and repeat. Although these patterns are always changing, this manual process is an effective way to score your content and take action on your insights in the future.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>This can be a tedious process, and it only scrapes the surface of a true content scoring system, but it's a thorough and important process to implement. For more effective and efficient results, you can use an automated tool like <a href=\"https://www.atomicreach.com/hubspot/index.html\">Atomic AI</a> to help you score your content in more granular patterns.</p> \n<p>Content scoring helps your brand set a benchmark for itself, moving you closer to understanding customer's buying stages and expectations. When you've established the content types that work for a specific customer segment, you can easily replicate your success over and over again.</p> \n<h2>Start Creating Consistent Content</h2> \n<p>Creating a content marketing strategy is one of the most important steps you can take for your marketing team. To do so, take an audit of your current content and figure out what works for your business.</p> \n<div>\n <em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in November 2017 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em>\n</div> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Blog - Content Mapping Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbenefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2000ba0b-ea58-45a5-ac81-3b463d992c1a.png","linkMd5":"f48b0633cc12bf22e2e7c7df87fbabc6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn52@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-07-747_0182497c26874791.webp","destWidth":522,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6131,"destBytes":8284,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2000ba0b-ea58-45a5-ac81-3b463d992c1a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn52@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-07-747_0182497c26874791.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn71@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-14-955_d198dce450120884.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbenefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn60@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-14-944_c09e6f666cdc5067.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087121},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"How to Embed a Facebook Feed On Your Website [Quick Tutorial]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-feed-on-website","description":"<p>Facebook is an undeniably powerful channel for marketing purposes.

Your timeline is officially embedded on the HubSpot landing page of your choosing.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. Squarespace</span></h3> \n<p>If you host your website on Squarespace, you're going to follow most of the instructions listed above. However, the third step varies for this website hosting platform.</p> \n<p>Let's explore how to embed a Facebook feed on Squarespace. It's important to note: Adding JavaScript or IFrames to Code Blocks is a <strong>Premium feature</strong>&nbsp;available in Business and Commerce plans, so you'll need a Premium account to proceed.</p> \n<p><strong>1. First, go to </strong><strong><a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin/\">Facebook's Plugin Page</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/embed%20facebook%20feed%20on%20website-Mar-30-2021-02-42-44-41-PM.jpeg?width=624&amp;name=embed%20facebook%20feed%20on%20website-Mar-30-2021-02-42-44-41-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p><strong>2.

WordPress</h3> \n<p>WordPress varies slightly from the instructions listed above.</p> \n<p>Instead of using Facebook's custom code, you can use a WordPress plugin. (Note: You will need to upgrade to the Business plan on WordPress to use this plugin feature.)</p> \n<p>For our purposes, let's use this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-facebook-feed/\">Smash Balloon Social Post Feed plugin</a>, which is 5-star rated and has over 200,000 active installations.</p> \n<p>Before proceeding with the following steps, ensure you install the plugin on your Business plan WordPress account. You can install either via the WordPress plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your web server (in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory). Then click \"Activate\".</p> \n<p><strong>1. Navigate to the 'Facebook Feed' tab within WordPress to configure your feed. Then click \"Connect a Facebook account\" and choose your Business page. </strong></p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/embed%20facebook%20feed%20on%20website-Mar-30-2021-02-42-45-99-PM.jpeg?width=624&amp;name=embed%20facebook%20feed%20on%20website-Mar-30-2021-02-42-45-99-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p><strong>2. Next, copy the shortcode [custom-facebook-feed] to embed your feed on your site. (You can also display multiple feeds of different Facebook pages by specifying a Page ID directly in the shortcode: [custom-facebook-feed id=smashballoon num=5].)</strong></p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/embed%20facebook%20feed%20on%20website-1.png?width=624&amp;height=96&amp;name=embed%20facebook%20feed%20on%20website-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"96\"></p> \n<p><strong>3.

Wix</span></h3> \n<p>For Wix customers, you'll use a third-party tool — <a href=\"https://elfsight.com/\">Elfsight</a> — to create the unique code that you can use on your Wix website, which is why there are a few additional steps in this list.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Create your own Elfsight Apps account, or login to your existing account. (It's free to embed one Facebook feed code.

article, we'll cover each platform's unique features, the key differences to keep in mind, and the factors to consider when deciding which ad platform to use.</p> \n<p>Let's get started.</p> \n<p>These platforms are often pitted against each other but in fact, Facebook Ads and Google Ads are complementary, each offering unique benefits to marketers.</p> \n<p>If your team can only focus on one, there are a few things you'll want to consider.</p> \n<h3>Your Campaign Goal</h3> \n<p>What do you want to accomplish with your campaign? Is it brand awareness, leads, sales, or something else? Knowing this answer can already steer you in the right direction.</p> \n<p>Google Ads is ideal for demand capture – meaning reaching users who have high purchase intent. For instance, if I'm looking up the keyword \"water bottle,\" this may signal an interest in purchasing one.</p> \n<p>With that in mind, the ads below align well with search intent and can lead to sales.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Google search ad example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ads%20vs.%20Google%20Ads%20Which%20is%20better%20for%20your%20brand%3F-1.png?width=624&amp;height=272&amp;name=Facebook%20Ads%20vs.%20Google%20Ads%20Which%20is%20better%20for%20your%20brand%3F-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"272\"></p> \n<p>Facebook Ads, on the other hand, is ideal for reaching consumers who are near the top of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage\">the funnel</a>, (i.e., great for brand and product awareness). <img alt=\"Facebook ad example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ads%20vs.%20Google%20Ads%20Which%20is%20better%20for%20your%20brand%3F.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>So, you could use both platforms at the same time to target users at every stage of the journey. But if that doesn't align with your broader objectives, knowing the main goal of your campaign will help you determine which platform is better suited to achieve it.</p> \n<h3>Your Budget</h3> \n<p>With any ad campaign, your goal is to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/return-on-ad-spend\">maximize your return on ad spend</a> (ROAS). It's easier to do that on some platforms than others.</p> \n<p>With Google Ads, you'll have to look at keyword competition and keyword price. If the keywords you're targeting have high cost-per-click (CPC) and you have a small budget, it may not be the best place for you to invest your money.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you have a $100 daily budget. You want to rank for \"hardware store\" in your local area but the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-ads-cost\">cost for that keyword</a> is $20. This means that you'd get a maximum five clicks per day – pretty limiting.</p> \n<p>With that same $100 budget, you could potentially reach more people on Facebook Ads and conduct experiments to learn more about which strategies work for your target audience.</p> \n<p>It's all about finding where your dollar will go the furthest in relation to your goals. Tools like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://hubspot.com/products/marketing/ads&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615400695272000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2DcGFVACBt4BIGl4BGT4tU\">HubSpot's ads software</a> can help you measure your campaign's ROI and allow you to make adjustments to optimize its performance.</p> \n<h3>Stages in the Buyer's Journey</h3> \n<p>As mentioned above, certain platforms align better with certain stages in the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buyer's journey</a>.</p> \n<p>With Facebook being a social media platform, most users are not actively looking to purchase products. However, they do explore and share their interests on the platform. With that in mind, it's a great place for users to discover your brand, especially if you don't think it relates to a topic users will be searching.</p> \n<p>In contrast, it's estimated that Google receives over 5 billion searches every single day. These searches can fall anywhere on the buyer's journey stage, but certain keywords indicate a high purchase intent.</p> \n<p>For example, if I search \"best water bottle\" or \"water bottle price,\" this suggests that I am interested in purchasing this item. With this approach, marketers can reach users they <em>know</em> are near the bottom of the funnel.</p> \n<h3>Historical and/or Competitor Data</h3> \n<p>As you develop your playbook for your next campaign, it will be helpful to look at historical data to inform your strategy. Knowing what has worked in the past, what hasn't and what is left to explore can serve as a reference and benchmark.</p> \n<p>If you've never run a campaign before, look at your competitors. What ads are they running? Where are they running them? What do their creative assets look like? What's their messaging?</p> \n<p>This <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-intelligence-competitive-advantage\">competitive intel </a>may highlight some areas for opportunity and give you insight into the strategies your competitors are using.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of Facebook Ads</h2> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">2019 HubSpot State of Marketing Report</a>, marketers revealed that the paid channel offering the highest ROI was Facebook. Let's dive into some of the reasons why.</p> \n<p>For starters, Facebook is the number one social media platform with over 2.7 billion monthly active users, according to a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/\">2021 Statista report</a>. In addition to its large audience base, the platform offers granular targeting capabilities, allowing marketers to reach users based on demographics, behaviors, life events and interests.</p> \n<p>Before launching a campaign on the platform, you can create a \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">lookalike audience</a>,\" which is essentially your<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\"> user persona.</a> Facebook Ads will then show your ads to audiences who match your description.</p> \n<p>That's one advantage the platform has over Google Ads – it's much more detailed in who you're able to target for your ads.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, you may also be able to reach more users and get a better clickthrough rate (CTR) through Facebook Ads. <a href=\"https://www.smartinsights.com/internet-advertising/internet-advertising-analytics/display-advertising-clickthrough-rates/\">Smart Insights reported</a> found that in Q1 of 2020, the median CTR for a Facebook ad on the newsfeed was 1.11% – compared to .47% for Google Display ads in the same time period.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of Google Ads</h2> \n<p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://economicimpact.google.com/methodology/\">Google estimated</a> that for every dollar a business spends on ads, it earns $8 in profit. Let's see why that may be and how the platform can be useful for brands.</p> \n<p>Google Ads, formerly known as Google Adwords, initially offered only very simple text-based ads on the search engine. Now, it's evolved to include features that can drastically improve clickthrough rates, such as reviews, detailed contact information, a shopping function, and mobile optimization.</p> \n<p>In Q1 of 2020, <a href=\"https://www.smartinsights.com/internet-advertising/internet-advertising-analytics/display-advertising-clickthrough-rates/\">Smart Insights</a> found that Google search ads had the highest CTR at 1.55% when compared to display ads and Facebook ads. This is likely because Google prioritizes ads based on relevance.</p> \n<p>While you do have to bid on keywords, the highest bid doesn't necessarily always win. Your bid gets your foot in the door, your ad's relevance to the keyword the user's search intent gets you in the house.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns\">Remarketing</a>, which is reconnecting with users who have interacted with your brand before, is now much easier using Google Ads. So, let's say someone visited your site and added something to their shopping cart but didn't complete their purchase. You can now re-engage users as they search on Google, watch a YouTube video or navigate a site within Google's Display Network.</p> \n<p>In addition, the platform's simple interface and advanced features like search term report, ads editor and auction insights make it easy to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns\">build, launch and track campaigns</a>.</p> \n<p>With Facebook Ads and Google Ads, one isn't inherently better than the other.

Then you’d leave the mall and think about it the whole drive home, wondering if you made the right decision until you forgot about it. That was until you saw someone else with the exact item we wanted. Ah, the good ol’ days.</p> \n<p>Today, you can’t leave an item in your cart without it following you <em>everywhere</em> online. Who do we have to thank for that? Technically, a lot of people – marketers, retargeting tools, Al Gore’s internet – but for the purpose of this article, we’ll focus on one: dynamic ads.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Download Now: Free Ad Campaign Planning Kit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08.png\" /></a></p> \n<p>Dynamic ads allow brands to change the ads shown to users based on their behavior.</p> \n<p>Let’s dive into what exactly dynamic ads are, their benefits, and how to use them on social media platforms like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-content-marketing\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-paid-ad-checklist\">Facebook</a>.</p> \n<p>Dynamic ads are often used in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-content-remarketing-campaigns\">remarketing campaigns </a>to reach users who have already interacted with a brand. More on that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/dynamic-ads#remarketing\">here</a>.</p> \n<p>Static ads, on the other hand, do not adapt based on external data, so they tend to target broader audience groups for brand awareness or product launches.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/banner-ad-clicks\">A banner ad</a> can look like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dynamic-ad-website-example.jpg?width=300&amp;name=dynamic-ad-website-example.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Or like this:</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dynamic-ad-facebook-example.jpg?width=300&amp;name=dynamic-ad-facebook-example.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example on facebook\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>They range in size and placement depending on the platform on which they’re displayed.</p> \n<h2>The Benefits of Dynamic Ads</h2> \n<p>Ad personalization is one of the biggest advantages of using dynamic banner ads. In a <a href=\"https://info.innovid.com/2020-consumer-attitudes\">2020 study by Innovid</a>, 43% of respondents agreed that ads should be personalized.</p> \n<p>What’s more, 30% of respondents said they liked brands more when ads were personalized. It’s easy to understand why – there’s nothing more annoying than getting an irrelevant ad that doesn’t relate to you or your interests. In fact, it’s a major reason why people get adblockers.</p> \n<p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.audienceproject.com/resources/insight-studies/attitude-towards-advertising-and-use-of-ad-blocking-2/\">AudienceProjects surveyed</a> people in the US, UK, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland and found that avoiding offensive or irrelevant ads was the second most popular reason why they got adblockers.</p> \n<p>The more personalized the ad, the better the chances it will resonate with the audience. This brings us to the next benefit of dynamic ads: relevance.</p> \n<p>While an ad may be personalized, it may not be relevant to that user’s current stage in the buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p>For instance, imagine you’ve heard of a brand but aren’t exactly sure what they do or what they offer. Getting an ad to request a product demo may be too big of a jump. You may need more nurturing before you reach that level of interest in their products.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, dynamic ads can help you only present ads that will meet the user where they are. Doing so can move them further down the funnel and help generate more revenue for your brand.</p> \n<p>This brings us to return on investment (ROI). Because of the reasons outlined above, your dynamic ads can optimize your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/return-on-ad-spend\">return on ad spend</a> (ROAS) because they are more targeted and relevant to each user.</p> \n<h2>How Dynamic Search Ads Work</h2> \n<h3>What are dynamic search ads?</h3> \n<p>Dynamic search ads (DSAs) are dynamic ads that show up on search engines like Google and Bing based on the content of your website, not keywords.</p> \n<p>When marketers set up <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-engine-marketing\">search campaigns</a>, they bid on specific keywords and create ads that match the intent behind the keywords. For instance, let’s say you’re a website operations company and you want to rank for the keyword \"best WebOps platforms,\" you’ll need to bid on it and win to show up on the search engine when a user searches that keyword.</p> \n<p>With dynamic search ads, you don’t have to bid on the keywords. The search engine will analyze the user’s search query and scan your website for relevant content. If the search engine determines it’s a match for what the user is looking for, it will automatically generate the ad with a headline and text based on a relevant landing page from your website.</p> \n<p>The main benefit of using DSAs is that it allows marketers to target audiences who may fall outside of the keywords they’re already targeting in their campaign.</p> \n<p>Think of a dynamic search as a safety net; even a well-designed search campaign won’t target all of the keywords your user persona might search for. The dynamic ad identifies new targeting opportunities and fills that gap by aligning your content with the right users – earning you extra traffic and more reach.</p> \n<p>It’s also a time-saver. With dynamic ads, you don’t have to go through the process of mapping out keywords, setting up bids, and creating copy for every single ad.</p> \n<p>My latest browsing sessions have involved a lot of furniture and home decor websites. This is why my Facebook feed includes ads like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-dynamic-ad.jpg?width=400&amp;name=facebook-dynamic-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Dynamic Display Ad example on Facebook\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">And why I see ads like this when browsing online.</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/website-dynamic-ad.jpg?width=500&amp;name=website-dynamic-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Dynamic Display Ad on website\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">They work just as regular dynamic ads do, adapting their content to the user for better results.</img></p> \n<p>You can take your display ads one step further by creating responsive dynamic display ads. It’s a mouthful, I know but the concept is simple to understand: A responsive ad adjusts its size based on the space on the page.</p> \n<p>For example, you’re on a website and you minimize the page to make space for another window. A responsive ad would adapt its shape based on that new space – just like a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/responsive-design-list\">responsive website</a>.</p> \n<p>This creates a better user experience and ensures your ad will be displayed correctly no matter the screen size.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Dynamic Remarketing Ads</h2> \n<p>Let’s say I visit the <a href=\"https://sabai.design/\">Sabai Design</a> website to look at furniture. Then, I put a beautiful emerald green couch in my cart but don’t complete the purchase.</p> \n<p>If the brand sets up dynamic remarketing ads, I’d see that couch, and similar styles, as I’m scrolling through social media or browsing through websites over the next few days or weeks<em>. </em></p> \n<p>The way dynamic remarketing works is by pulling the product feed from your website and leveraging user data to show your visitors ads that will move them down your funnel.</p> \n<p>You can target various ad groups, ranging from visitors who’ve only visited your product pages to those who have already purchased items from you.</p> \n<p>Then, once you generate the ad copy and the offers, the ad platform you use will do the rest. This means pulling the relevant product information to show that specific user.</p> \n<h2>LinkedIn Dynamic Ads</h2> \n<p>When creating a dynamic <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-advertising-campaigns\">ad on LinkedIn</a>, you will target users based on their profile, including demographics such as location, work experience, company, and job title.</p> \n<p>There are three main formats to use when creating ads on the professional network:</p> \n<h3>Follower Ads</h3> \n<h3 style=\"color: #434343; font-size: 14px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/linkedin-dynamic-follower-ad.jpg?width=225&amp;name=linkedin-dynamic-follower-ad.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Dynamic Follower Ad\" width=\"225\" style=\"width: 225px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">If you want to gain more followers on your LinkedIn Company Page, create a Follower Ad. This will encourage users in your ad group to follow your Page and learn more about your brand.</img></h3> \n<h3>Spotlight Ads</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/linkedin-dynamic-spotlight-ad.jpg?width=225&amp;name=linkedin-dynamic-spotlight-ad.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Dynamic Spotlight Ad\" width=\"225\" style=\"width: 225px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>Want to drive traffic to your website or landing page? Use a spotlight ad. You can also use it to promote upcoming events, highlight your products or services, or gain new email subscribers.</p> \n<h3>Content Ads</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/linkedin-dynamic-content-ad.jpg?width=225&amp;name=linkedin-dynamic-content-ad.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Dynamic Content Ad\" width=\"225\" style=\"width: 225px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Content offers are great <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-generation-strategy\">lead magnets</a>. This dynamic ad format allows you to generate leads through downloadable offers. You can manage those leads in the LinkedIn Campaign Manager or export them to a CRM like the HubSpot <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ads\">Marketing Hub’s Ads Software</a>.</img></p> \n<p>You’ll notice that none of these ads show up as a carousel image, single image ad, video, or text ad. That’s because dynamic ads on LinkedIn are only formatted to show up on the right sidebar on desktop view. Like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/LinkedIn-dynamic-ad.jpg?width=500&amp;name=LinkedIn-dynamic-ad.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Dynamic Ad Example\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<h2>Facebook Dynamic Ads</h2> \n<p>On Facebook, things work a little differently. In this case, dynamic ads are ideal for brands with a large inventory of products and/or services. Unlike LinkedIn ads, when creating a dynamic ad on Facebook, you can choose any ad format, including single image, carousel, stories, or collection.</p> \n<p>Here’s how Facebook dynamic ads work: You can create a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-facebook-ad-types\">retargeting campaign</a> to reach consumers who’ve had previous interactions with your brand, or reach a broader audience that matches your user persona and may be interested in your products or services.</p> \n<p>To set up a dynamic ad on Facebook, you’ll need:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>A catalog </strong>– This contains the products and services you want to promote, with descriptions, prices, images, availability, and other relevant information.</li> \n <li><strong>Facebook pixel or DSK</strong> – You must install a Facebook pixel on your website or SDK for your mobile app to capture how your users are behaving on your webpages or app.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>From there, you will set up your campaign in the Ads Manager to outline your ad objectives, ad format, copy, and calls-to-action (CTA) by product set.</p> \n<p>Every time a user fits your targeting parameters, the machine learning program will use the pixel to gather user data and pick relevant products or services from your catalog to display the ad on mobile, tablet, or desktop.</p> \n<p>This saves marketers time, as they don’t have to create an ad for every single product or ad group.</p> \n<p>You may no longer need those drives home from the mall to decide if you <em>really</em> should have bought something. With dynamic ads, you get multiple chances to reconsider your decisions.</p> \n<p>Whether that’s a good thing varies from person to person, but from a marketing standpoint, it’s another opportunity to win over a consumer. Why not take it?</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=46d72524-f4a7-44e9-9af0-935be9bb3891&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \"
