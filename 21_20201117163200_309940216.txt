But when Vicky falls in love with Lermontov&#8217;s rising composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring) during the rehearsals for her debut as lead dancer in <em>The Red Shoes</em>, the ballerina begins to crack under the pressure to choose between her two passions: art or romance.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Essential Quarantine Viewing:</strong> There&#8217;s no question that <em>The Red Shoes</em> is one of the most gorgeous Technicolor films to ever grace the screen. Shot in three-strip Technicolor, a process that&#8217;s no longer used because of expense and technical complexity, <em>The Red Shoes</em> blazes with color and light and vibrancy to the point of being intoxicating. It culminates in the film&#8217;s famous 17-minute ballet sequence, an impressionistic piece of fantasia that would go on to inspire Gene Kelly&#8217;s ballet sequences in <em>Singin&#8217; in the Rain</em> and <em>An American in Paris</em>, and mark a cinematic high for director-writer duo Powell and Pressburger.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646118\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;Why do you want to dance?&#8221; Lermontov asks Vicky at a post-show party, after Vicky&#8217;s aunt tries to orchestrate an opportunity for her to dance in front of the ballet impresario. &#8220;Why do you want to live?&#8221; she replies. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know exactly why, but&#8230;I must,&#8221; a taken aback Lermontov says. &#8220;That&#8217;s my answer too,&#8221; Vicky quickly replies, instantly making an impression on the jaded genius.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a conversation that sets up the film&#8217;s grand ideas of artistic passion, and how quickly it can snowball into an all-consuming obsession with fatal consequences. <em>The Red Shoes</em> is the kind of epic tragedy that befits the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale that inspired it, but in Powell and Pressburger&#8217;s glorious Technicolor vision, it feels fresh, thrilling, and exhilaratingly cinematic.</p>\n<p>The central conflict in <em>The Red Shoes</em> is that of classic melodrama: duty or love? Career or family? Ambition or a life as &#8220;a faithful housewife with a crowd of screaming children and finish with dancing forever,&#8221; as Lermontov so cruelly puts it to Vicky while attempting to convince her to return to dance the lead part in <em>The Red Shoes.</em> A harsh reality for a woman in the 1940s, but an extreme vision of those who are wholly dedicated to their craft.</p>\n<p>Written, directed, and produced by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the duo behind <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-black-narcissus-is-full-of-pent-up-desire/\"><em>Black Narcissus</em></a> and other British classics, <em>The Red Shoes</em> is considered one of their greatest achievements: an ode to artistic ambition and a display of the intensity and artistry of dance that is still unmatched today. While its themes and twisted view of the pursuit of art would be touched on and expanded upon by other filmmakers <em>(</em>Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s <em>Black</em> <em>Swan</em> in particular comes to mind)<em>,</em> <em>The Red Shoes</em> is still unrivaled in its ecstatic command of color, and is the apex of what Technicolor could be.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-the-red-shoes/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;The Red Shoes&#8217; is Technicolor Passion Come to Life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7wGYgODGrtY:pg328GT4SIg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7wGYgODGrtY:pg328GT4SIg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7wGYgODGrtY:pg328GT4SIg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7wGYgODGrtY:pg328GT4SIg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7wGYgODGrtY:pg328GT4SIg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7wGYgODGrtY:pg328GT4SIg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7wGYgODGrtY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 15:00:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-red-shoes-1-e1605620305559-700x369.jpg","linkMd5":"46f38631a693fb9dc8990918174fc4fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_2/2020/11/17/16-31-55-728_2073409ac3bb9996.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":369,"sourceBytes":28305,"destBytes":15778,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-red-shoes-1-e1605620305559-700x369.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_2/2020/11/17/16-31-55-728_2073409ac3bb9996.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn99@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-57-309_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7wGYgODGrtY:pg328GT4SIg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn56@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-59-284_7ec9d61d7b363c21.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-57-279_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7wGYgODGrtY:pg328GT4SIg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn48@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-57-387_19ea0dd40659b654.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7wGYgODGrtY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn71@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-57-509_de789234640e1bd4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630654312},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:54","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:54","title":"‘His Dark Materials’ Enters a Brave New World With “The City of Magpies”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646106","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646109\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-1-700x370.jpg\" alt=\"his dark materials the city of magpies review\" width=\"700\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-1-700x370.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-1-360x190.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-1-768x405.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-1.jpg 968w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>His Dark Materials</em></strong> is going through some growing pains. The first season couldn&#8217;t quite meet its own <em>Game of Thrones</em>-sized ambitions, which hobbled the show before it could really find its footing. Was it a dark, serious epic fantasy? Or the whimsical YA adventure that <strong>Philip Pullman</strong>&#8216;s novels first presented as? <em>His Dark Materials</em> ended up falling somewhere in the middle, and while the first season was a far more respectful adaptation than the disastrous 2007 film <em>The Golden Compass</em>, it was a tonally confused series that didn&#8217;t seem to know where to place the pieces of whimsy in Pullman&#8217;s book within its larger narrative.</p>\n<p>While some remnants of its <em>Game of Thrones</em> ambitions remain in the first episode of <em>His Dark Materials</em> season 2, especially in the show&#8217;s insistence to show the epic sprawl of the growing ensemble, &#8220;City of Magpies&#8221; enters a brave new world: one where the show is much more confident as a rich religious fantasy epic that isn&#8217;t afraid to let out a laugh every now and then. But season 2&#8217;s premiere still finds itself stumbling over the spillover from season 1, taking a little too long to establish its setting and its characters before it can get to the real meat of the story.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646106\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646111\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-4-e1605589178247-700x352.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-4-e1605589178247-700x352.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-4-e1605589178247-360x181.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-4-e1605589178247-768x386.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-4-e1605589178247.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Lyra of the Flies</h2>\n<p>A witch&#8217;s prophecy casts an immediate shadow over the season: &#8220;It’s time to prepare&#8230;to draw sides,&#8221; the witch declares, as Asriel&#8217;s portal to another world sends everyone — witch, priest, an animal, alike — into a frenzy. There is a prophecy that follows this &#8220;tear in the sky,&#8221; the witches warn, of a young girl lost in another world. But unaware of the coming war and her prophesied part in it is Lyra (<strong>Dafne Keen</strong>), who wanders the warm climates of the new world while mourning her best friend Roger&#8217;s death at Asriel&#8217;s hand. It doesn&#8217;t take long before she finds the city in the sky that so captivated her when she saw it in Asriel&#8217;s pictures — a vibrant, Mediterranean city that is eerily empty.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s nice to see Lyra&#8217;s daemon Pan have an even stronger presence right off the bat in season 2 (after the show&#8217;s budget in season 1 allowed him a few key appearances before disappearing for random intervals), voicing Lyra&#8217;s thoughts as they wander the abandoned streets and acting as her conscience when Lyra&#8217;s bullishness gets the best of her. The latter comes into play when Lyra is suddenly approached by Will (<strong>Amir Wilson</strong>), the boy from our Earth who had wandered into the city through a window in the air. Lyra, still stung by Asriel&#8217;s betrayal and her part in Roger&#8217;s death, is unwilling to put her trust in this strange boy with no daemon, but Pan is oddly comfortable with him, speaking to Will for Lyra while she gives him the cold shoulder.</p>\n<p>Finally, we get to see our two protagonists interacting, and both Keen and Wilson&#8217;s performances are all the stronger for it. I still think it was a mistake to introduce Will in season 1 — writer <strong>Jack Thorn</strong>e was too eager to push up the story&#8217;s big game-changing twist of multiple worlds, and as a result, Wilson felt a little lost throughout the season. There&#8217;s no replacing the whopper of beginning <em>The Subtle Knife</em> from Will&#8217;s POV, only for Lyra to suddenly crash in like a feral child. But Keen and Wilson finally gel when they&#8217;re together, Keen loosening up her portrayal of Lyra a little and finding a little humor in the role, and Wilson finding a wild-card character to bounce his turmoiled YA hero persona off of. The two of them immediately strike up a wonderful little screwball dynamic, teasing each other and clashing with each other — whether over strategies (Lyra, always the type to dive headfirst into conflict, while Will is ever the mediator) or over the differences in their worlds. It&#8217;s embodied by the hilarious omelet two-part sequence, in which Will cooks an omelet for a suspicious Lyra, who sniffs it and eats it like a burrito before calling him a kitchen boy, then later attempts to cook an omelet for Will made mostly of cracked shells. I can&#8217;t exactly explain why this scene was so important to book fans (we willed it into being!) but it&#8217;s such a nice refreshing piece of levity in an otherwise heavy episode that shows that <em>His Dark Materials</em> is ready to lighten up a bit.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646110\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-3-700x332.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-3-700x332.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-3-360x171.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-3-768x364.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-3.jpg 1144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>A Question of Faith</h2>\n<p>The first episode of season 2 is very much an establishing episode, and that&#8217;s where &#8220;The City of Magpies&#8221; begins to drag. The series seems determined to show itself as a sprawling epic, so the check-ins on our disparate storylines à la <em>Game of Thrones</em> begins: there are the witch tribes congregating to discuss whether to follow the prophecy surrounding Lyra and join Asriel&#8217;s fight, or to wage war against the Magisterium, who has kidnapped one of their own. There is the Magisterium, debating whether to reject Asriel&#8217;s tear in the sky, and what information the captured witch can give them. While the witches and their dark fae design make them a least impressive to look at, the Magisterium subplot will never be interesting, no many British character actors smirk and chew scenery.</p>\n<p>The only saving grace of the Magisterium (leaning into their fascist designs even more this season, with a very Soviet-style submarine setting) is Mrs. Coulter, played by series MVP <strong>Ruth Wilson</strong>. Ever so chilling and unpredictable, Mrs. Coulter volunteers to torture the witch for information, resulting in one of Wilson&#8217;s standout scenes of the show. By simply removing her rings and earrings while talking clinically to the witch, Mrs. Coulter strikes a terrifying figure, which only becomes more frightening as she clicks a pair of tweezers while approaching her subject. Mrs. Coulter pulls the cloud pine from the witch&#8217;s back as the witch screams in agony — it&#8217;s not as gnarly as the finger-snapping torture of the book, but it&#8217;s a dash of body horror that may be even more effectively disturbing. The scene escalates as Mrs. Coulter realizes that the prophecy refers to Lyra, and Wilson once again puts her whole body into her performance: her voice becoming deep and hoarse as she becomes desperate for answers about her daughter. But the interrogation is cut short by witch queen Ruta Skadi (newcomer Jade Anouka) who stabs the captured witch before she can reveal more, and cuts a bloody streak through the Magisterium submarine.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646108\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-700x350.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-700x350.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-201.jpg 1584w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Spectre of Adolescence</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyra and Will discover that they&#8217;re not so alone as they thought, spotting two young girls who immediately run away upon being seen — Lyra, in classic hotheaded fashion, taking off after them while Will takes a more strategic route to corner them. One of the girls is played by none other than <em>Game of Thrones</em> alum <strong>Bella Ramsey</strong> (little Lyanna Mormont), as salt-of-the-earth and quick-witted as her past famous role. Ramsey&#8217;s Angelica reveals to Lyra and Will that the city of Citagazze had been invaded by Spectres, soul-sucking creatures who only attacked adults. Their parents and most of the adults in the city were killed, while the rest fled, leaving only the children to roam the empty streets — until they came of age. &#8220;That one&#8217;s close,&#8221; she nods to the visibly older Will, on the cusp of adolescence. But after raiding a bakery with Will and Lyra, Angelica and her sister Paola (Ella Schrey-Yeats) remain evasive about what they were there to do, and run off, leaving Will and Lyra to ponder this strange new world they&#8217;ve found themselves in, and what to do next.</p>\n<p>But upon realizing that the two both hail from two different Oxfords, worlds apart, Lyra insists that Will take her back to his world so that she can find out more about Dust, to which Will reluctantly agrees.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>Subtle Sidenotes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keen has found a knack for physical comedy: first her accidentally dropping an egg and rubbing it into the floor with her shoe, then her sniffing herself when wondering whether she needs a &#8220;standing bath.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong> makes his best attempt at noble anxiety, but feels enormously out of place in the witch&#8217;s council.

The eighth installment of the series follows Jason as he stalks a group of high school graduates on a ship en route to New York City.</p>\n<p>The film’s musical score was composed by <b>Fred Mollin</b>, who worked with longtime <i>Friday the 13th</i> composer <b>Harry Manfredini</b> on the previous installment, <i>Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Jason Takes Manhattan</i> was the first film in the series not to feature Manfredini credited on the score. Navigating away from traditionally used strings and horns, Mollin’s score to <i>Jason Takes Manhattan</i> is electronic based and utilizes digital keyboards and synthesizers popular of the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-646103 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fridaythe13-part8-vinyl-gatefold-discs-700x587.jpg\" alt=\"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Vinyl Soundtrack\" width=\"700\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fridaythe13-part8-vinyl-gatefold-discs-700x587.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fridaythe13-part8-vinyl-gatefold-discs-360x302.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fridaythe13-part8-vinyl-gatefold-discs-768x644.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fridaythe13-part8-vinyl-gatefold-discs.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The score was sourced from the original master tapes from the Paramount Pictures vaults, and it&#8217;s been restored and remastered on the 2xLP record on NYC Grime and Hot Pink Flying V colored vinyl.

Steven Caple Jr. only has two feature films on his resume: his breakthrough indie project <em>The Land</em>, and the <em>Rocky</em> spin-off sequel <em>Creed II</em>. The latter was a solid sequel to the rejuvenating <em>Creed</em>, but many felt it didn&#8217;t quite measure up to the greatness that director Ryan Coogler brought to the franchise. But even so, it proves that Caple Jr. can craft a serviceable sequel with established characters.</p>\n<p>Even though Steven Caple Jr. is now boarding the project, we still know next to nothing about what this movie will be. The report mentions that Paramount Pictures is charting a new course for the series, but we&#8217;re not sure if that means this is a hard reboot that ignores the rest of the movies, or a soft reboot that picks up sometime after the events of <em>Bumblebee</em>, a movie which somewhat rebooted the franchise by taking the story back to the 1980s and using the original G1 character designs.</p>\n<p>When the two new <em>Transformers</em> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/transformers-reboot-two-new-movies-paramount/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">projects were announced</a>, it was said that Paramount Pictures wanted them to &#8220;build out multiple arcs and to also expand the <em>Transformers</em> universe.&#8221; That presumably means that any of the human characters previously introduced would have been left behind. While one of the scripts was said to be set in the same universe as the previous movies, the other was said to be a &#8220;grand-scale reimagining.&#8221; And here&#8217;s where things get confusing.</p>\n<p>The other script being written by <strong>James Vanderbilt</strong> was said to be based on <em>Transformers: Beast</em> <em>Wars</em>, with a story set in the future of the &#8220;original&#8221; <em>Transformers</em> continuity and followed the clash of the Maximals and the Predacons, descendants of the Autobots and Decepticons. So if the <em>Beast Wars</em> movie is set in the future of the &#8220;original&#8221; <em>Transformers</em> continuity, then that could be the one set in the same universe as the previous movies. That would mean Harold&#8217;s script could be the &#8220;grand-scale reimagining,&#8221; and we could be heading into total reboot territory.</p>\n<p>The <em>Transformers</em> movies already have quite the convoluted timeline, especially when it comes to their history with Earth. So all of this confusion is par for the course with the franchise. Keep in mind that in addition to these two movies, <em>Toy Story 4</em> director Josh Cooley is still <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/animated-transformers-prequel-director-josh-cooley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">working on an animated <em>Transformers</em> film</a> focusing on Cybertron and the origins of the war between the Autobots and Decepticons. And that&#8217;s separate from the rest of the <em>Transformers</em> movies.</p>\n<p>Obviously the <em>Transformers</em> franchise is a high priority for Paramount Pictures, and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what they do with these characters after relying on the universe that Michael Bay built for so long.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/steven-caple-jr-to-direct-the-next-transformers-movie/\">&#8216;Transformers&#8217; Franchise Embarking on a New Course with &#8216;Creed II&#8217; Director Steven Caple Jr.</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=m2nNuP9kHww:NSu1bNgtYAU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=m2nNuP9kHww:NSu1bNgtYAU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=m2nNuP9kHww:NSu1bNgtYAU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=m2nNuP9kHww:NSu1bNgtYAU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=m2nNuP9kHww:NSu1bNgtYAU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=m2nNuP9kHww:NSu1bNgtYAU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/m2nNuP9kHww\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 15:32:29 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/transformers-1-700x293.jpg","linkMd5":"faeeb31af3d54f2a4df0babf640ac19f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn8@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-12-912_0ebd539b9b920ca2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":293,"sourceBytes":57048,"destBytes":44690,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/transformers-1-700x293.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn8@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-12-912_0ebd539b9b920ca2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn99@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-57-309_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=m2nNuP9kHww:NSu1bNgtYAU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn52@2020_2/2020/11/17/16-31-57-278_8da4249262fedb8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-57-279_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=m2nNuP9kHww:NSu1bNgtYAU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn88@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-57-256_d1ec017765392d00.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/m2nNuP9kHww":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-57-329_9876afa1206d1051.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630654311}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:54","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:54","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:30:54 +0000","fetchMs":131,"handleMs":684,"totalMs":66991,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"ab22ccae49a680c841ff007fee8203b8","hostName":"europe-23*","requestId":"1c48c4c20e4c4fb695962d5c131c73ec_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":352654,"bgimgsTotal":5,"bgimgsGithubTotal":5,"articlesImgsTotal":28,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":28,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1,"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx7":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx6":1,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx4":1,"myreaderx32":1,"myreaderx3":1,"myreaderx11":1,"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx30":2,"myreaderx31":1,"myreaderx18":1,"myreaderx19":1,"myreaderx":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx22":1,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx24":1,"myreaderx5oss":1,"myreaderx29":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
