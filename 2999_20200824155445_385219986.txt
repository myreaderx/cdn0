It requires you to put a lot of smart work and hard work in place to make any sizable income.</p> \n<p>But if you are aware of some robust marketing strategies that almost always deliver the results, your job can become a bit easier, and you can gain many customers easily. We know this, so we are going to share our knowledge and experience with you. In this article, we will introduce you with eight best eCommerce marketing strategies you can implement to boost your sales. Let us get started!</p> \n<h2>1. Utilize the power of Google Shopping Ads</h2> \n<p>In today’s time, there can be no better place to get your visitors than Google. The traffic coming from it converts more than any other traffic source, and it is also quite cheaper than the traffic from other marketing channels. However, the ranking will take time in Google’s search results. If you do not have that much patience, you can harness the power of Google Shopping Ads that appear on the top of the search pages whenever someone searches for a product. They look something like this:<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unnamed-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113373\" />\n</figure> \n<p>As you can see, these ads not only allow you to occupy the top of a search results page but also will enable you to hook your visitors by showing a price, an image, and other relevant information right there on the search page itself. So, whoever visits your site by clicking these ads is more likely to convert into a customer, and you pay only when they click – which means a very high return on investment.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>2. Use SML (schema mark-up)</h2> \n<p>SML stands for Structured Mark-up Language. This language, also known popularly as Schema, helps search engines in better crawling and understanding of your site. By adding SML to your product pages, you can ensure that they are crawled and indexed correctly by Google and other search engines. While&nbsp;it doesn’t directly impact your search rankings, it does so indirectly by making your pages appear with information-rich snippets that entice people to click on your link instead of other links. And when that happens, it increases your Click-Through-Rate (CTR), which is an important ranking signal used by Google in its algorithms. As a result, you start moving up in search results from a steady pace.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>3. Upsell your products</h2> \n<p>In case you are not aware of it, upselling refers to selling a more premium or better version of your product than the customer is willing to buy. By doing this, you can increase your revenue without necessarily acquiring new customers, and that is precisely what makes this strategy cool. The strategy works because many times; the customer is not fully aware of what options – better or worse – are available in the market other than the product that (s)he is going to buy. If you can offer a better deal on your product pages by upselling relevant products, it can become a win-win situation for both you and your customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>4. Protect your site with an SSL certificate&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>Since we are about security, it is also important to discuss another security-related element that can turn visitors away from your site if it appears. If your website lacks an SSL certificate and therefore loading over default HTTP protocol instead of the more secure HTTPS, web browsers show a&nbsp;<em>“Not Secure”</em>&nbsp;label before your URL in the address bar. Something like this:</p> \n<p>You can imagine what such a label appearing before your URL can do damage to your brand. The visitors to your site will feel that something is seriously wrong with the security of your website (which would also be true, given the importance of SSL) and immediately hit that dreaded Close Tab button. If you want to ensure that it does not happen, install an SSL certificate on your site. In case you are clueless about which certificate to buy,&nbsp;there are many SSL certificates out there in the market like Comodo certificate, DigiCert certificate, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xpY2tzc2wubmV0L2dlb3RydXN0LXNzbC1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0ZXMtYXV0aG9yaXplZC1yZXNlbGxlcg%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113372\"><strong>GeoTrust SSL certificates</strong></a>&nbsp;are among the best ones in the industry.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>5. Pay attention to site speed</h2> \n<p>The speed of your site matters a lot when you are selling something. Nobody likes waiting nowadays – especially if they are looking to purchase something. If your site is slow to load, they will close it and want to buy from somewhere else. Do not let that happen – increase your site speed by following the steps outlined below:</p> \n<p>Enable caching on your site.</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Eliminate unnecessary elements from your product pages (i.e., excess javascript/CSS, images/media loading from external sources, multiple widgets, etc.)</li>\n <li>Choose a reliable web hosting company</li>\n <li>Check your site with&nbsp;the Google Page Speed Insights&nbsp;tool and implement the steps suggested to boost your Page Speed score.</li>\n <li>These steps can help you enough in ensuring that your site loads faster.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul> \n<h2>6. Leverage email marketing</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam90Zm9ybS5jb20vZW1haWwtbWFya2V0aW5nLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113372\">Email marketing</a> may sound like an old technique in an all-social media-driven world. However, it still works wonders for many businesses. Especially if you are running an eCommerce business, you can leverage its power in many ways. You can start a blog that sends customers to your product pages after they’re educated enough to purchase your product, you can also use email addresses of your users to inform them about a product that was out of stock as soon as it’s back in stock. Last, but certainly not least, you can also tell your customers about various sales offers you are running through emails.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>7. Use Trust Seals on your checkout page</h2> \n<p>Often when people do not buy from your site, it is not something wrong with your marketing, but with the security, elements included, or not included in your website.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xpY2tzc2wubmV0L2Jsb2cvYmlnZ2VzdC1zZWN1cml0eS10aHJlYXRzLWZvci1hbi1vbmxpbmUtYnVzaW5lc3M%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113372\"><strong>Security threats for an online business</strong></a>&nbsp;are among the top concerns in your mind and in the minds of your potential customers, which is why they do not purchase from sites that do not make them feel safe. If you want to make your visitors feel safe on your website, include some Trust Seals from reputed brands on your site (especially your checkout page), as shown above. You will need to purchase some security-related products from these brands to display these seals, but that is worth it because it will also boost your sales revenue.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>8. Use videos in your product pages and marketing strategy</h2> \n<p>Finally, use the power of video to improve your product pages and boost your marketing. On product pages, videos can be used to provide your customers with a better understanding of the product they are buying. Off the product page, they can be used as a marketing tool to send visitors to your site through video sharing platforms like YouTube and other social media channels. It would help if you crafted a solid marketing strategy around it, and you can drive tons of traffic and sales to your eCommerce site through this one marketing medium alone.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4> \n<p>So, these were eight best eCommerce marketing strategies you must implement to boost your sales. It is easy to implement them and necessary because, without these strategies, you cannot get the best ROI out of your marketing campaigns.

This is down to the level of confidence that visitors will need prior to enrolling with you or signing up for more information.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With this in mind, let’s take a deeper look into the relationship between content and digital education organisations. Here are five key reasons why quality content is key to the success of online learning platforms:</p> \n<h3><strong>Demonstrate Your Credibility</strong></h3> \n<p>When it comes to online learning, one of the most significant ways of building conversions is through demonstrating your credibility.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Online courses, in particular, can be significantly time-consuming and demanding challenges for users, and it’s of the utmost importance that they know their efforts will be rewarded with a recognisable qualification in return for their hard work.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To entrust you with their contact information (not to mention bank details), visitors will <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmljY2EuY28udWsvYmxvZy8xMi1yZWFzb25zLXdoeS1jb250ZW50LW1hcmtldGluZy1pcy1hbi1pbXBvcnRhbnQtcGFydC1vZi15b3VyLW1hcmtldGluZy1taXgv&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113098\">need to have confidence in your platform’s credibility</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9zb2x2aWQuY28udWsvaG93LXRvLXN0YXJ0LWEtYmxvZy8%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113098\">creating content for an on-site blog or news feed</a>, you have a large canvas in which to not only build keywords and backlinks but to also build trust in your services and forge some levels of confidence in your platform.</p> \n<p>Content marketing can influence users by showing that your education website is well run and possesses a great deal of industry expertise.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s also possible to make content from testimonials and product reviews as a means of getting the message across that your company is a great choice for customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The topic of education is a tricky one to demonstrate credibility in. While pass rates and satisfaction scores can help to show that your courses are successful, it’s only from content that interested visitors will gain a better understanding of exactly what you’re offering.</p> \n<h3><strong>Make Your Platform Visible</strong></h3> \n<p>Content gets you noticed. Search engine optimisation forms the cornerstone to great content and carries the power to drive traffic to your website as well as high-quality do-follow backlinks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Primarily, your learning platform needs to be visible to the right audiences at the right time. Because so many users look to Google to find the things they’re looking for online, it can be easy to create content that utilises searchable keywords.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Simply speaking, if you can build articles that use the right blend of keywords and on-page SEO, you can make your platform much more visible at the top of Google’s results pages, as opposed to vying for space among rival organisations with advertising campaigns.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The best thing about optimising your content is that it can create a steady stream of traffic over time, rather than the more short-term approaches of PPC advertising campaigns.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>Generate Awareness</strong></h3> \n<p>Creating awareness of your organisation and brand can run up expensive PR bills. Content marketing, however, could be significantly more cost-efficient and every bit as expensive for your target audiences.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here, it could be written content, video-based insights into your office environment, or copy optimised for social media, as long as it helps potential customers to feel more familiar with your company it can be a great asset.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When you produce on-site content, always make sure you talk of your business as if it were a living organism, as opposed to conveying yourself as an independent author. Readers can identify with a personable approach and build a level of trust in your organisation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While brand awareness isn’t typically easy for companies to actually quantify, it’s an integral goal for marketing departments to get some form of branding under the noses of target audiences in order to build familiarity. High-quality and engaging content is one of the most effective and non-intrusive ways of developing branding.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>Accommodate Niche Audiences</strong></h3> \n<p>The great thing about content is that it can appeal directly to your readers’ wants and needs. The better you know your target audience, the more specific your content can be in appealing to their motivations. While sales and service pages need to be appealing in a more general sense, content pieces can cherrypick specific talking points among groups that you’ve identified as among the most likely to enrol into your learning platform.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s important to note that this approach requires a significant level of pre-planning and audience knowledge. If you can identify the needs of your target market, it should be down to your company to satisfy them through your content.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It may seem counterintuitive to pigeonhole your content to appeal to niche audiences, but in this current age of saturated content and hyper-competitivity, it’s effective to step back from your goals and look at where you can fine-tune your approach.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>Call Your Visitors to Action</strong></h3> \n<p>Fundamentally, the most effective benefit that content has over other forms of marketing is the discreet way in which calls-to-action (CTAs) can be added to your copy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For an online learning platform, this is especially useful to encourage visitors to access further information or fill out sign-up forms.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The process of signing up to an online course can take a little time, so it’s vital that platforms can build enough levels of interest in visitors before asking if they’re willing to follow up on their interest online.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Be sure to supply your target audience with a healthy level of information and confidence-building copy before inviting them to sign up to a newsletter or share their email address for alerts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Remember that online education involves plenty of effort and commitment for digital students. It’s only fair that online learning portals share the same level of enthusiasm. </p> \n<img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113098\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"display: none;\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:51:31 +0000","feedId":2999,"bgimg":"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nick-morrison-FHnnjk1Yj7Y-unsplash-1024x768.jpg","linkMd5":"6c619ccbd9ab959693e02259fc1567a4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn14@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-51-38-127_2149a7647e923cfb.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":768,"sourceBytes":327380,"destBytes":53962,"author":"Peter Jobes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nick-morrison-FHnnjk1Yj7Y-unsplash-1024x768.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn14@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-51-38-127_2149a7647e923cfb.webp","https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113098":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn62@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-51-46-175_fb2fadd04505c7b0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598284297221},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","title":"5 Steps to Improve Your Logo Design","link":"https://www.noupe.com/?p=113294","description":"<div>\n <img width=\"1000\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-1-3.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" />\n</div> \n<p class=\"opener\">As you move forward in your career, your logo designing skills should be honed as well if you keep practising it. However, to come up with something extraordinary, that would create a striking impression; simply practising is not enough.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Listed below are 5 steps that can help you improve your logo designing skills and <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm91cGUuY29tL2Rlc2lnbi9ob3ctdG8tZGVzaWduLWFuLWljb25pYy1sb2dvLmh0bWw%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113294\">create a logo</a> that leaves a lasting impression on the minds of your target audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Conduct In-depth Research</strong></h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm91cGUuY29tL2Rlc2lnbi90aGUtZG9zLWFuZC1kb250cy1vZi1sb2dvLWRlc2lnbi5odG1s&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113294\">Logo design</a> is not about mixing and matching a few colours and making it look pretty. It may sound clichéd but a logo is the face of your brand and thus it should have all the correct elements that would click with the audience. Thus, in-depth research is extremely important. From your client to their brands and their competitors, as a logo designer, you need to keep your game up and see what you can do to come up with a dynamic logo or may improve their existing one.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Thorough research means that you understand the company and the brand and what it does. Similarly, you need to be aware of the competition as well. Research of all the related sources from their website to social media platforms, everything should come under your scrutiny. You must be wondering why to study social media platforms? Well, it is the best place to learn about the targeted audience and what they want from your client.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>2. Deep &amp; Probing Questions</strong></h3> \n<p>If you are working on your logo yourself or you have been asked to improve an existing logo of a brand, the second most important thing after the research is to ask deep and probing questions that would help you create their <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9mdWxsc3RvcDM2MC5jb20vbG9nby1kZXNpZ24%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113294\">custom logo</a>. Probe deeply and find out the vision behind the brand and what exactly do the leaders in the company perceive about it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>From the target audience to the ideas for growing the business, you need to ask everything. Ask about the brand’s competition, long-term goals and even if some questions seem irrelevant, it is essential that you ask the questions anyway as it will only add to the improvement in designing a custom logo.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Mobile-Oriented</strong></h3> \n<p>The third most important step when it comes to logo designing or tweaking is; that it should be customized for the mobile phones. Whether you are designing a logo from scratch or improvising an old one, both should be customized according to the requirements of the mobile phones. When you are conducting the research, you will realize that many companies have simplified and flattened their logos to make it easier to see on the mobile screens. From Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft and eBay and many more have adopted this strategy and <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm91cGUuY29tL2Rlc2lnbi9kZXNpZ24tdGlwcy15b3UtY2FuLXVzZS10by1lbWJyYWNlLW1pbmltYWxpc3QtbWFya2V0aW5nLWRlc2lnbi5odG1s&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113294\">minimalized</a> their logos.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The reason behind all tech giants adopting this element is that mobile phones have become more popular for online navigation than desktops and laptops and too complex designs can lose their impact on the mini-screens of cell-phones. To keep the logo recognizable, it is of utmost importance to keep the logo identifiable and minimal for the small mobile screen.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Step Out from Comfort Zone</strong></h3> \n<p>Want to phenomenally improve your <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/design/the-dos-and-donts-of-logo-design.html\">logo design</a> or polish up your skills to an extraordinary level? Then, the font that you use can make all the difference. A unique and distinctive font can become your brand’s identity and set it apart from the competition. Take the example of the Harry Potter franchise. The unique font that was introduced in the first Harry Potter movie more than twenty years ago is a trademark for the brand. The audience automatically associates that particular font with everything that has to do with HP franchise. New fonts are being introduced every now and then, and you can also find one that really identifies with the brand you are working on.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you think that you will have to pay for the new fonts, then it is a misconception. With tools like <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL3RyL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2lsbHVzdHJhdG9yLmh0bWw%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113294\">Adobe Illustrator</a>, you can tinker with various font styles without having to spend money on them. Some others even offer trial services before you purchase the actual thing. So, go ahead and experiment with fonts for some inspiration. You don’t have to necessarily spend a lot of money to take advantage of new fonts, either.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>5. Study the Maestros</strong></h3> \n<p>When you go online, there is myriad of logo designs and there are galleries full of it. However, not all these designs are done by gurus in the field. In fact most of them are the creation of students and amateur designers. To get true inspiration, you must study the maestros in the field and only then will you be able to improve your logo design.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When it some to learning, do not compromise; learn from the most phenomenal maestros in the field – the big brand logos. Don’t settle for less than the best when it comes to logo designs and get your inspiration from those who have managed to persist even after the arrival of all the new technology.&nbsp;Whatever you do, you need to remember that when it comes to log design, your targeted audience will never pay attention to its minute details. On the contrary, they will just glance at it for milliseconds and that’s the time you have to make an impression. Keeping your designs minimal yet impactful, it needs to touch a chord with the subconscious human instincts at their most primal level. Whatever you do, always design or improvise the designs keeping the human audience in mind. They are no experts of all the intricacies in your design. They need to connect with the brand on a psychological level with a few milliseconds.</p> \n<p>This is what you can see when it comes to the logos of famous brands like Nike, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s or even the tri-petal design of Adidas. Simply put, try to understand the psychology of the audience you are targeting and you will be able to establish yourself as an extraordinary logo designer and improve your logo designs phenomenally.&nbsp;</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly91bnNwbGFzaC5jb20vQGpkaWVnb3BoP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dW5zcGxhc2gmYW1wO3V0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmYW1wO3V0bV9jb250ZW50PWNyZWRpdENvcHlUZXh0&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113294\">Diego PH</a> on <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly91bnNwbGFzaC5jb20vcy9waG90b3MvZGVzaWduP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dW5zcGxhc2gmYW1wO3V0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmYW1wO3V0bV9jb250ZW50PWNyZWRpdENvcHlUZXh0&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113294\">Unsplash</a></p> \n<img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113294\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"display: none;\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 11:18:14 +0000","feedId":2999,"bgimg":"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-1-3.jpg","linkMd5":"87efefab67c78613353c36fab3eb581d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-51-38-881_31325dd2cc7e532b.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":471,"sourceBytes":252064,"destBytes":14716,"author":"Hammad Dogar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-1-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-51-38-881_31325dd2cc7e532b.webp","https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113294":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn10@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-51-45-593_2e3330b0763cc778.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598284297212},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","title":"4 Essential Ways to Check Your Website’s Health","link":"https://www.noupe.com/?p=113280","description":"<div>\n <img width=\"1000\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-1-2.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" />\n</div> \n<p class=\"opener\">Many website owners falsely think that their websites are going to work perfectly forever. However, in reality, all websites eventually break.</p> \n<p>This happens because sites are running out of date, plugins stop working, or as a result of a cyberattack. If you want to avoid these issues altogether, the solution is rooted in regular digital health checks. In this article, I’ll focus on the simple and inexpensive website health check ways that will help your website run flawlessly!&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>What is a website health check and why do you need one?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>A website health check implies breaking down the anatomy of your website to evaluate the functionality, performance, and design of your web pages. Here’s why it’s important to conduct regular website health checks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Any change that you make on your pages somehow affects the overall health of your site. Let’s say, you’ve decided to add a second Spanish version of your website. This can influence the speed and overall performance of your site. That’s why designing and implementing a regular website maintenance check is an absolute must.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Not particularly sure where to begin your site’s health check? No worries, we’ve got you covered. Here’s a list of the four essential factors to make sure your website is healthy.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>1. <strong>Performance testing&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpbmt3aXRoZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRpbmctcmVzb3VyY2VzL2RhdGEtbWVhc3VyZW1lbnQvbW9iaWxlLXBhZ2Utc3BlZWQtbmV3LWluZHVzdHJ5LWJlbmNobWFya3Mv&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113280\">53% of users</a> will leave your website if it doesn’t load within 3 seconds? Moreover, studies show that website speed directly impacts business’ profitability.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113281\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Image Source: </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlLmdvb2dsZWFwaXMuY29tL3R3Zy1jb250ZW50L29yaWdpbmFsX2ltYWdlcy9tb2JpbGUtcGFnZS1zcGVlZC1uZXctaW5kdXN0cnktYmVuY2htYXJrcy0wMS0yMS5wbmc%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113280\"><em>https://storage.googleapis.com/twg-content/original_images/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks-01-21.png</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>This way, your website’s speed and performance are the key factors contributing to the revenue generated and your overall success.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Performance testing is considered a part of a website’s health check and one of the most challenging testings. Performance testing is executed to test the responsiveness, speed, scalability, and throughput of your website.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are many ways to carry out performance testing. For example, you can use dedicated online tools and browser extensions.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. <strong>SEO testing&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is another important aspect of your website. Your site’s ranking and discoverability in search engines can play a major role in the overall success of your website and your business in general. That’s why you want to ensure your SEO is in place as a part of the website health check.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Regular SEO testing will help you identify the best SEO tactics for your business. In the meantime, simple SEO practices will help you keep your site healthy. For example, by regularly updating your web pages and images, you can boost your ranking on Google and get rid of the outdated content.&nbsp;<br /></p> \n<h3>3. <strong>Security checking&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>As more businesses are operating online, there is a growing threat of cyberattacks. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZW50dXJlLmNvbS9fYWNubWVkaWEvUERGLTk2L0FjY2VudHVyZS0yMDE5LUNvc3Qtb2YtQ3liZXJjcmltZS1TdHVkeS1GaW5hbC5wZGYjem9vbT01MA%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113280\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">studies show</a> that 68% of business leaders feel that cybersecurity risks are increasing. That’s why ensuring security is a crucial step towards a healthier website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As much as we all rely on the web, it’s not exactly the safest place. Your website may be exposed to cyberattacks by accident or by mistake. For example, you can install a plugin without even knowing that it’s carrying malware. In the meantime, the faulty plugin is infecting your website and puts the entire system at risk.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To keep your website safe and keep off cybercriminals, you need to check and update your website regularly. Use website security checking tools that can enable you to do the following:</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Detect viruses and malware</li>\n <li>Detect phishing attacks, ActiveX attacks, buffer overflow, and other vulnerabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n <li>Check user IPs against various spammer databases&nbsp;</li>\n <li>Detect whether or not your SSL certificate expires soon</li>\n <li>Manage regular website updates&nbsp;</li>\n</ul> \n<h3>4. <strong>Broken links testing</strong></h3> \n<p>Besides performance, SEO, and security checking, there is another aspect commonly overlooked when checking website health – links.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The web consists of a plethora of links that are used to locate and connect pieces of information. A single website can have hundreds and even thousands of links. However, when these links become broken, it will affect your website’s speed and overall performance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Links do so much more than just sending users to your website. They are accountable for displaying graphics, data, and various applications.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here’s a list of links you should keep an eye for when checking your website health:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul>\n <li>External links to other websites&nbsp;</li>\n <li>Internal links to your images&nbsp;</li>\n <li>Internal links to pages&nbsp;</li>\n</ul> \n<h3><strong>Tools for website health checks&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>Gathering required information that can show you the problem areas is the first step of the website health checking. Once all of the needed data has been collected, the next step is to take the required actions to fix the problems.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here are some tools you can use to check your website’s health.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4><strong>Google Search Console&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image1-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113282\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Image Source: </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9nbGltcHNlLm1lZGlhL3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDIwLzA0L2dvb2dsZS1zZWFyY2gtY29uc29sZS1sb2dvLTEyMDB4Njc1LnBuZw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113280\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>https://glimpse.media/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/google-search-console-logo-1200×675.png</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Google Search Console is a free tool that helps you monitor, maintain, improve your website’s presence in Google Search results.

In this matter, you can say that smooth video editing is much more than just straight cutting. It’s creating an enticing story and vision.</p> \n<p>When it comes to video editing, you don’t need a master’s film degree to be an editor. Even if you’re a graphic designer, you can still sit in the editing room, working with the directors and sound engineers.</p> \n<p>Whatever your background is, there are some pretty definitive ‘rules’ that you should stick to in order to get the videos right. Get them wrong, and your videos end up looking very flat and boring, making them look unprofessional.</p> \n<p>Below are some basic <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9icmVhZG5iZXlvbmQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3ZpZGVvLWVkaXRpbmctdGlwcy8%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113329\">video editing tips</a>, especially for graphic designers, to produce the most enjoyable video for the viewers.</p> \n<h2>Graphic Designers and Video Editing: How It’s Related</h2> \n<p>But, before we get into the nitty-gritty, it’s important to understand why you can’t actually separate video editing and graphic design.</p> \n<p>Graphic designers and video editors might be two different professions, but they are short of interconnected with one another. Graphic design is all about creating images using the composition of colors, lines, textures, and shapes. Meanwhile, video editing is “designing” the video by creating a story using a combination of footage, color, typography, symbols, and more.</p> \n<p>It means that it’d be much helpful if you have design skills while editing videos. Those kinds of skills will help add value to your works and excel in your field, leading to more opportunities.</p> \n<h2>Video Editing Tips for Graphic Designers</h2> \n<p>Since films or videos are also very much designed in the same way that you design posters or brochures, we mostly focus on the editing tips that have a strong element of design.</p> \n<h3>1. Utilize the Best Video Designing Tools</h3> \n<p>Thanks to the internet — now you can easily use software and any other <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9icmVhZG5iZXlvbmQuY29tL3ZpZGVvLW1hcmtldGluZy90b29scy8%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113329\">video tools</a> you need to help you create well-edited, stunning videos. There is a bunch of software out there, and they basically offer you basic editing features for standard video edits.</p> \n<p>In this case, you can choose the right ones for you based on your preferences and needs. So, you need to pay attention to their usability, digital interface, and features. Make sure all of them match your editing capabilities and style.</p> \n<p>Some of the most popular <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/essentials/video-editing-software.html\">video editing software</a> are After Effects, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, and more.</p> \n<h3>2. Master the Hotkeys</h3> \n<p>Keyboard shortcuts might sound nerdy. After all, you’re not an IT director that needs this thing the most.</p> \n<p>However, since video editing takes already long enough, you can speed up the process by mastering some keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These combinations of keys on the keyboard help you perform a certain task within a program faster and more comfortably than by using a mouse. In other words, it bridges the gap between effort and action, helping you save more time to move from point A to point B efficiently.</p> \n<p>What’s more, mastering hotkeys also allows you to fine-tune details in your audiovisual projects. Therefore, you can create a compelling video without taking too much time spent on the point-and-click method.</p> \n<h3>3. Think About Color Corrections</h3> \n<p>Color is such a crucial element when it comes to video graphics. It sets the mood and helps convey the overall message. And in most video production, even with the help of good light settings or excellent scenery conditions, the raw footage you have still tend to be over-saturated and bland at first.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Therefore, you need to balance them out with color corrections by adjusting the levels of particular colors within it — which every graphic designer has been dealing with.</p> \n<p>Color corrections help your final product to have a consistent color palette. It ensures that no detail is lost when your video is watched on the viewers’ screen.</p> \n<h3>4. Add Stunning Graphics and Effects</h3> \n<p>Graphics can make a bigger difference to your video production. In this case, there are many different types of graphics you can add to your video to make it more engaging and captivating.</p> \n<p>For instance, you can add motions to make the viewers more focus on the content. You can add logos to make great branding enhancements. You might also add some typography or titles to make it easier for viewers to digest the content.</p> \n<p>The key to adding graphics here is to help your audience to quickly recognize and seamlessly connect emotionally with you and your video.</p> \n<h3>5. Understand the Lingo</h3> \n<p>Just like any other industry, video editing has a language all its own. And one thing that can make your <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/what-is-workflow.html\">workflow</a> much easier is understanding that language. Remember, editing not only comprises “the cut” since there’s no single way to edit footage.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In this situation, understanding video editing terms won’t only help you edit an astounding video and make it easier for you to communicate with other editors or clients.</p> \n<p>From transition to jump cut, learning the lingo and speaking the post-production team’s language can spark your creativity and improve your editing skills.</p> \n<h3>6. Strive for Clarity</h3> \n<p>Both design and editing are fundamentally about striving for clarity. So, even though it’s great to know a lot of editing techniques and design skills, it’s crucial to keep it clean and easy on the eye.</p> \n<p>More techniques applied to the editing process doesn’t always mean a better final result. Make sure you don’t go overboard with your editing. It will make your video chaotic, and the viewers will have a hard time understanding what you are talking about.</p> \n<p>Try to only add the elements that will improve your video and avoid using unnecessary ones. With clear and simple editing, the viewers are left in no doubt about what’s being discussed in the video.</p> \n<h4>Wrapping Up</h4> \n<p>Video editing is such a key process in production since it’s not all about stunning visuals, but it’s also about making the viewers feel emotionally connected. Your editing goal should always be to deliver an enticing story that can evoke your viewers’ emotions.</p> \n<p>Sometimes that means you need to break some industry standards to make your video unique and stand out among the rest. That’s why design skills can help you to improve the final results.

But video allows you to say a lot more,” says Randall Harp, creator in chief at <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9jaGFwZWxoaWxsbWVkaWEuY29tLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">Chapel Hill Media</a>. This idea captures the sentiment behind<em> </em>video marketing.<em> </em>To be more concrete about it, video marketing is a modern content marketing tactic businesses use to generate interest in their products and services.</p> \n<p>Video marketing lets you communicate a lot more information to prospects and customers in less time than written content, and it helps audiences connect with your brand in a more engaging way.<strong> </strong>Below we answer a few questions to help solidify the concept of video marketing.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"> \n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"> \n  <img src=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-is-video-marketing-03-700x544.png\" alt=\"video marketing\" class=\"wp-image-295057\" /> \n </figure> \n</div> \n<h3>3 FAQs about video marketing</h3> \n<h4>Why video marketing?</h4> \n<p>Harp calls out two key reasons why video marketing has become such a popular tactic for marketers:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Culture shift.</strong> People tend to be visual, so it’s not surprising more people are choosing to watch instead of read since video is more commonplace today. <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHN5Y2hvbG9neXRvZGF5LmNvbS91cy9ibG9nL2dldC1wc3ljaGVkLzIwMTIwNy9sZWFybmluZy10aHJvdWdoLXZpc3VhbHM%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">Studies show</a> that people receive and remember information better when it’s visual. “Plus, we live in a fast-paced culture where we’re very conscious of time, and reading takes more of it. That’s why video is such a great way to reach people rather than expecting them to sit and consume pages of text,” he explains.</li> \n <li><strong>Technology.</strong> The ability to produce and consume video has become much easier thanks to easier-to-use creator tools, smartphones, and social media. “While high-quality, well-scripted videos are easier to make, not every video has to be a Hollywood production. You can use your smartphone to record, then quickly and easily upload it to any social platform,” he says.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How is video marketing being used?</h4> \n<p>While consumers tend to create videos for nonmonetary reasons, Harp notes that companies, of course, use video marketing to benefit their business. Specifically, they use it to</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Sell products.</strong> Many businesses use popular social platforms like Instagram, which focuses on visuals, to showcase their products. These social posts can then help drive people to a brick-and-mortar store or send them directly to an online shopping site.</li> \n <li><strong>Increase brand awareness.</strong> Businesses can also use videos to promote their brand or corporate identity, though Harp says this is typically reserved for larger companies with equally large budgets — for example, Coca-Cola and Apple.</li> \n <li><strong>Share information.</strong> Today’s digital landscape has spawned a knowledge culture that’s willing to pay for information. People such as Instagram influencers and business coaches often capitalize on this by engaging with viewers through videos and live streaming to create a following of people who may eventually convert to customers — purchasing courses, diet and exercise plans, sales training, and so on.</li> \n <li><strong>Promote company culture.</strong> From a different perspective, businesses also use video marketing to attract new talent. By giving prospective employees a look behind the scenes, businesses can open the door to their company culture and spur a desire to work there.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Tips for getting started with video marketing</h4> \n<p>If you’re just beginning your video marketing journey, Harp has several <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam90Zm9ybS5jb20vYmxvZy92aWRlby1tYXJrZXRpbmctdGlwcy8%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">video marketing tips</a> you can use to start off right:</p> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><p>Each video should have a clear purpose</p><p></p></li> \n <p>To maintain clarity, always ask these three questions before making a video:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Who is your target audience?</strong> Pinpoint your audience for each particular video. Be as specific as possible. For example, if you’re selling a diet plan, are you speaking to people with a particular health concern — losing weight, building muscles, developing six-pack abs, etc.? Knowing your audience makes it easier to both speak to them <em>and</em> measure the effectiveness of your video.</li> \n  <li><strong>What do you want them to feel?</strong> Stats are nice, but people likely won’t remember them. They will, however, remember how your video made them feel. Maybe you want them to feel hopeful, peaceful, energized, etc. This will spur them to the next part.</li> \n  <li><strong>What do you want them to do?</strong> Give them something to do, a next step. Make it as easy as possible. For example, have them call a number or visit a website — be sure to provide a URL to a page that talks specifically about what you covered in the video to maximize effectiveness. Get them in the pipeline and start them on the journey of becoming a customer.</li> \n </ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><p>Understand the importance of quality</p></li> \n <p>“Many people don’t know this, but audio quality is actually more important than video quality,” Harp advises. People will endure bad visual quality over bad audio quality. If they can’t hear what’s being said, they lose patience quickly. But if a video has good audio and not-so-great visuals, people tend to be more willing to stay in hopes that the video will improve.</p> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><p>Be consistent</p></li> \n <p>Make sure the videos you’re producing are consistent compared to one another and with your overall brand. For example, try to use the same intro for each video — the sound and style of graphics should be the same.</p> \n <p>“This lends itself to the <em>know, like, and trust</em> factors of sales,” Harp says. “For example, consider how GEICO and Progressive insurance have used the same spokespersons for their companies for years. They often even use the same colors, sounds, props, wardrobe, and set for their videos.”</p> \n</ol> \n<p>Now that you understand video marketing as a concept, let’s get into the benefits you can expect to receive from it.</p> \n<h2>Video marketing benefits, ROI, and social media</h2> \n<p>For years marketers have been shouting, “Content is king!”</p> \n<p>Why?</p> \n<p>Because content has helped many companies bring in more business. And given the rise in video consumption in recent years — <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9iaXRlYWJsZS5jb20vYmxvZy90aXBzL3ZpZGVvLW1hcmtldGluZy1zdGF0aXN0aWNzLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">55 percent of people view online videos every day</a> — video might be the front-runner for favorite type of content.</p> \n<p>There are plenty more stats where that came from, but in this chapter we’re looking at the reason those stats exist. So if you’re still on the fence about video marketing, the points below will ensure you’re aware of its upsides.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"> \n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"> \n  <img src=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Benefits-of-video-marketing-04-700x544.png\" alt=\"Video marketing benefits, ROI, and social media\" class=\"wp-image-295097\" /> \n </figure> \n</div> \n<h3>The importance of video marketing</h3> \n<p>“Video marketing gives you the opportunity to provide valuable information to businesses you want to work with,” says Ken Kerry, executive creative director at <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zY3JpcHR0b3NjcmVlbi5jb20v&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">Script to Screen</a>. This information may be answers to specific questions your target audience has, advice about unique challenges they’re facing, or even clarifications regarding myths that could be holding potential customers back from making decisions.</p> \n<p>Kerry’s own video content marketing serves as a first impression of Script to Screen for a company that might be considering their services. His strategy is to provide content that not only shows his company’s capabilities (such as with an awareness video), but his team’s ability to address challenges or needs similar to the prospect’s (such as with a case study video).</p> \n<p>“Our belief is that, by presenting our expertise with tangible business results first, we create the ability and the permission to explore how we can best serve new clients,” Kerry says.</p> \n<h3>Benefits of video marketing</h3> \n<p>Aaron Nix,<a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hYXJvbm5peC5jb20v&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\"> </a>assistant professor of art, video producer, and <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hYXJvbm5peC5jb20v&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">filmmaker</a>, has helped conceptualize and create many videos. He calls out several key benefits of video marketing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Improved engagement.</strong> Video gives you the ability to engage your target audience using more than just words. Higher engagement translates to more people watching more of your video, extending their interaction with your brand. “With video, your audience is more involved. Instead of just reading or quickly scrolling past an image, you capture their attention and engage their senses for an extended period of time,” he explains.</li> \n <li><strong>Increased brand awareness.</strong> “People are always looking to engage with other people’s stories and events. It’s a part of our social culture now,” he says. Since video is easily accessible in our media-saturated culture — live events, streaming, social media, etc. — people expect video and are drawn to it. While they may scroll past an image, video makes them pause. Using video gives you the opportunity to share your brand with more people, instead of being ignored.</li> \n <li><strong>More compelling storytelling.</strong> “The more senses you can engage, the more interesting you can make the story,” Nix explains. Video is much more dynamic than text or still images, which means you can communicate complex subject matter in a simpler way and convey important aspects like tone. People connect with stories, so creating a compelling one can help endear people to your brand.</li> \n <li><strong>Greater trust.</strong> “People are time-sensitive, so asking them to take even 30 seconds out of their day can be a big ask,” he says. If you’re able to give them something they like and engage with — whether it’s emotional, comedic, or something else — that builds trust with your brand.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Social media and video marketing</h3> \n<p>The average person spends <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhdGlzdGEuY29tL3N0YXRpc3RpY3MvNDMzODcxL2RhaWx5LXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS11c2FnZS13b3JsZHdpZGUv&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">144 minutes per day on social media</a> — nearly two and a half hours — and that number is trending upward every year. Is it any wonder that many experts recommend including social media as part of your video marketing efforts?</p> \n<p>“People’s eyes are constantly on their feeds, but there’s a massive amount of noise people have to wade through every day,” Nix explains. In addition, the digital intelligence of the average user has increased as people become more social media savvy. They expect more from video, so getting your target audience’s attention requires a well-produced, extremely relevant social media video they can connect with.</p> \n<h3>Achieving ROI with video marketing</h3> \n<p>Video ROI comes in many forms — it really depends on the type of business you operate. Nix shares a few example goals:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Recruiting people.</strong> Whether you’re looking to attract students, athletes, or employees, awareness is a big part of this goal, and it doesn’t always have clearly trackable metrics. Useful proxies are social media <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam90Zm9ybS5jb20vYmxvZy92aWRlby1tZXRyaWNzLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">metrics</a>, such as a growing following. You can also use more direct means like sharing a video on social that links to a <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/what-is-a-landing-page.html\">landing page</a> and tracking performance. “Notably, video engagement is typically higher than any other post type on our social media pages,” says Nix of the college where he works.</li> \n <li><strong>Generating donations.</strong> Donations are a significant boon to nonprofits and colleges. A video/landing page combo comes in handy here, too, as you can share videos that speak to the causes donors care about. Nix says his college may share a video aimed at former students to elicit their support. “We typically have a specific campaign, such as for the annual day of giving, where we track performance for a specific class year to see how many responded versus donated.”</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now you know how you can benefit from video marketing. Next, we walk through the main types of marketing videos you can make.</p> \n<h2>Types of videos</h2> \n<p>We’ve discussed a lot of concepts about video marketing, but now we move into the really interesting part — namely, the main types of videos you can create. Each has unique attributes you should be aware of to maximize their effectiveness.</p> \n<h3>6 video content types</h3> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Educational</h4></li> \n <p>Educational videos provide your audience — typically people who are already your customers — with information about your products, such as technical details or how best to use them in different situations. These types of videos are often used by software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies to instruct users how to navigate through the product to accomplish a specific goal.</p> \n <div class=\"wp-block-image\"> \n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"> \n   <img src=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Types-of-videos-700x544.png\" alt=\"education video marketing\" class=\"wp-image-295407\" /> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p>Lance Cummins, president of <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbnl2b28uY29tLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">Anyvoo</a>, explains that such <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam90Zm9ybS5jb20vYmxvZy9qb3Rmb3JtLTQtdmlkZW8tdHV0b3JpYWxzLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">tutorial videos</a> are most effective when they</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Sound conversational. </strong>People are fine being led, but they don’t necessarily want to be instructed. Tutorials should make users feel like someone is helping them accomplish something, not like they’re learning a lesson. “A conversational tone aids in making the experience real and genuine,” Cummins explains.</li> \n  <li><strong>Employ screen sharing. </strong>When you can hold a product in your hand, it’s a lot easier to reference specific parts of it in, say, an instructional manual. However, SaaS products tend to have lots of screens that look nearly identical to the average user, so it’s important that users be able to follow along — screen by screen — with a guide. Cummins points out that the mouse should be visible and screens should load in real time, as opposed to cutting these transitions. “You want the user to have a real experience — like they hopped on a screen share with someone from your company who’s walking them through the task.”</li> \n </ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Announcement</h4></li> \n <p>When your business has big news to share — for example, an upcoming merger or acquisition — this calls for an <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam90Zm9ybS5jb20vYmxvZy81LW1pbGxpb24tdXNlcnMv&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">announcement video</a>. However, Cummins cautions against focusing on your business as part of the presentation. “I’m a big proponent of framing any announcement to focus on the person hearing the message — your prospects, customers, and so on.”</p> \n <p>When writing the script for your announcement, Cummins suggests that you ask yourself</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>What is this news going to do for my audience?</li> \n  <li>Why will they care?</li> \n  <li>How does this help them?</li> \n </ul> \n <p>“If you can’t answer these questions, then you should rethink doing the video in the first place,” Cummins says.</p> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Product launch</h4></li> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g%2Fdj1sTGtlWjdraFN4dw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">Product launch videos</a> can be considered a type of announcement video since they announce when you’ve created or redesigned a new product, whether it’s tangible, such as a new car model, or intangible, like software. Whatever the case, your goal is to generate interest in your product. “You do this by helping your audience picture themselves using or experiencing what you’ve created,” Cummins says.</p> \n <p>He recommends producing a series of product launch videos, rather than just one. Multiple videos help people see a product from different perspectives, as well as consistently expose them to your product.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“Avoid just listing out features you think they’ll like, for example, the fact that a new line of glasses is made from Titanium. Instead, focus on evoking emotions from your audience — for example, they may want to feel smart. Make a clear connection between those emotions and your product,” says Cummins.</p> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Company culture</h4></li> \n <p>Company culture videos are typically used to provide an inside look at your business — how the business works, what employees think about working there, etc. These videos can also be used to engage current employees at workplace events. “If you’re showcasing your company culture at an annual get-together, by all means brag on yourself and share inside jokes.”</p> \n <p>In contrast, Cummins notes you should take a different approach if your company culture video is meant to help recruit new employees: “As with announcement videos, your culture video should focus on how your company culture would benefit a newcomer in the organization. And be sure that, when people speak, they are conversational. You don’t want anyone to sound like they’re reading from a teleprompter — it comes off as stiff.”</p> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Q&amp;A</h4></li> \n <p>Q&amp;A videos give you the opportunity to address questions from users or prospects. For example, you may get a lot of questions from customers on ways your product can be used. You can quickly collect and keep track of these customer questions with <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam90Zm9ybS5jb20v&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">JotForm</a>, an easy-to-use form builder.</p> \n <p>Cummins recommends setting up Q&amp;A videos interview style, with one person asking questions and the other one answering. To make the video more dynamic, you can place text on either side of the scene.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“This will help emphasize the question being asked,” Cummins says. “It will also help viewers who are watching the video for a specific question to easily find what they’re looking for.”</p> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Case study</h4></li> \n <p>Case study videos enable you to showcase how your organization has helped past clients overcome a particular challenge. For example, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g%2Fdj1UZkhzUHBkckNGayZhbXA7dD0zcw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">this case study video</a> walks through how one JotForm client uses the platform to make her <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/what-is-workflow.html\">workflow</a> easier — from collecting client consent forms to collecting client payments.</p> \n <p>“With case study videos, you definitely want the client to be a part of it,” Cummins advises, though that may mean you give up some degree of control. Still, the value in having a client speak to your organization’s capabilities will go a long way.</p> \n <p>In addition, case study videos can be a boon to video <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/email-marketing.html\">email marketing</a>. If you use email as a marketing tactic — cold <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/the-ultimate-cold-email-outreach-guide.html\">outreach</a>, automations, etc. — incorporating a case study video can help elicit a reply.</p> \n</ol> \n<p>With the different types of videos covered, we’ll discuss creating a video marketing strategy.</p> \n<h2>How to create a video marketing strategy</h2> \n<p>Developing a video marketing strategy isn’t too different from developing other marketing strategies, but the underlying medium naturally creates some distinctions — after all, video requires more time and money to produce than text or images. We discuss these distinctions below, along with steps you can take to develop a video marketing strategy of your own.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"> \n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"> \n  <img src=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/video-marketing-strategy-06-700x544.png\" alt=\"steps you can take to develop a video marketing strategy\" class=\"wp-image-295267\" /> \n </figure> \n</div> \n<h3>5 steps to creating a video marketing strategy</h3> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Define your business objective</h4></li> \n <p>“When you first start thinking about video, stop thinking about video. Instead, think about what you’re doing as a business,” says Robert Weiss, president of <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWx0aXZpc2lvbmRpZ2l0YWwuY29tLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\">MultiVision Digital</a>. Are you launching a new product? Are you moving into a new line of business? Your video goals should support these initiatives.</p> \n <p>For example, you wouldn’t want to focus on corporate overview or culture videos if you’re announcing a new product — your spend should go to product launch videos. “Video works best when it’s integrated into a thoughtful plan. And that plan can certainly evolve over time as your objectives change,” notes Weiss.</p> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Understand your target audience</h4></li> \n <p>As with any marketing-focused effort, knowing who you’re speaking to is critical. You’ve no doubt already defined your target audience, but ensure you have an in-depth understanding of who they are and what they want.</p> \n <p>According to Weiss, knowing your audience inside and out is important for your production efforts and the costs associated with them. “It’s about added efficiency,” he says. “You can output multiple videos that speak to different audience segments while using the same basic video components. Just make a few changes and you have a whole new video — without scheduling a whole new shoot.”</p> \n <p>For example, consider an insurance company that wants to produce videos featuring experts talking about insurance. The information will be largely the same, but different customers look for specific insurance products or coverage.</p> \n <p>“The company can share the same insurance knowledge, but change up the talking points and visuals to focus on aspects that newlyweds or retirees care about most,” Weiss explains.</p> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Identify distribution channels</h4></li> \n <p>The <em>where</em> of your video marketing strategy is another important component. You have to decide how best to reach your target audience with your videos. “The exact mix of distribution will differ depending on your business and the types of videos you make,” explains Weiss.</p> \n <p>Here are a few channels you may decide to use:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, etc.)</li> \n  <li>Social media (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.)</li> \n  <li>Google Ads networks</li> \n  <li>Your website</li> \n </ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Develop a video production budget</h4></li> \n <p>“I recommend starting small. You can test a monthly budget of around $1,000 until you’re satisfied with the results,” says Morten Storgaard, creator of <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXNzaXZlaW5jb21lZ2Vlay5jb20v&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113318\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PassiveIncomeGeek</a>. Then build up from there. A good video marketing budget is one that gives a promising return. As you add more to your budget and keep testing, you can further refine the idea of <em>good</em> and <em>acceptable</em> ROI.</p> \n <p>As far as what you’ll need to consider, Weiss calls out a few key elements:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Time and talent to write the script</li> \n  <li>Cameras and other equipment</li> \n  <li>Production and editing time</li> \n  <li>Motion graphics and color correction</li> \n  <li>Labor and experience of the crew</li> \n </ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;\"><h4 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Create your videos</h4></li> \n <p>Video branding is essential to establishing yourself with your audience. Make sure to include elements like your logo, slogan, and brand colors within the first five to 10 seconds of each video, especially if the video is an ad.</p> \n <p>Remember that users can typically skip video ads after a few seconds, or scroll past them on social. “Unlike traditional video ads for TV and streaming platforms, you can’t afford to tell the story first and then expect the viewer to watch to the end to find out who you are,” Storgaard explains.</p> \n <p>Also consider <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/why-are-videos-essential-to-seo-in-2020-and-beyond.html\">video SEO</a> optimization to ensure your content is ranked and seen. Weiss says one video likely won’t cut it — you’ll need several, just like with blog posts in traditional content marketing. And speaking of content marketing, Weiss notes that adopting a video-first strategy can help achieve greater video optimization: “This strategy is about creating content for video, then turning that content into supporting blog posts, social media images, emails, and so on.”</p> \n</ol> \n<p>Creating your own video marketing strategy may seem like a big challenge, but the above guidance should give you a great foundation to start.</p> \n<h3>Meet your video marketing guides</h3> \n<h4>Aaron Nix</h4> \n<p>Aaron Nix currently serves as an assistant professor of art and video producer at Concordia University, Nebraska in Seward, where he leads courses in film production, film criticism, digital media, and photography.

Whether you’re aiming to impart knowledge or simply inform students about upcoming events, your website should provide your community with any information they’re seeking.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The best education websites support your goals by incorporating solid design principles. To help, we’ll walk through these three design elements that can make your school stand out to students and families:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Develop engaging learning opportunities.</li>\n <li>Create a well-organized navigation bar.</li>\n <li>Offer straightforward forms.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>To easily incorporate these strategies, you’ll first need an intuitive content management system (CMS) built specifically for the education sector.

Develop engaging learning opportunities.</h2> \n<p>For the past several years, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm91cGUuY29tL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL3R1dG9yaWFscy1pbnNwaXJhdGlvbi90ZWNobm9sb2d5LWluLXRoZS1jbGFzc3Jvb20uaHRtbA%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\">the growing prevalence of technology in the classroom</a> has been a major consideration for schools. Now, due to the pandemic, schools and educators are having to reevaluate how they communicate with students, hold classes remotely, and keep students engaged while at home. With many schools making the shift to remote learning, educators are scrambling to figure out how to provide an engaging learning experience online.</p> \n<p>Through your school’s website, you can provide valuable learning opportunities and stay connected with students at a safe social distance. Let’s explore three primary learning opportunities you can offer through your school website:</p> \n<ol>\n <li><strong>Offer eCourses. </strong>With the shift to virtual learning, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9hcnRpc2FuZWxlYXJuaW5nLmNvbS9jdXN0b20tZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQ%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">eCourses</a> allow teachers to continue sharing knowledge with students from a safe distance. Upload these lessons directly to your school’s website. With a website builder that offers a student portal, you can ensure only designated individuals access these courses.</li>\n <li><strong>Create online assignments.</strong> Quizzes and assignments are an essential part of the learning process. Especially as schools shift away from paper assessments, it’s important to incorporate e-learning tools into your curriculum. Using <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam90Zm9ybS5jb20vZm9ybS10ZW1wbGF0ZXMvY2F0ZWdvcnkvcXVpei10ZW1wbGF0ZQ%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\">an online form builder with templates</a>, your teachers will be able to quickly create these quizzes, which will then be automatically graded as students complete them. </li>\n <li><strong>Run a blog.</strong> Blogging enables you to share news and updates with your website visitors. While your marketing team will primarily run the blog, you may also consider allowing your students and faculty members to take charge and craft some of the posts themselves. Work with your team to determine which approach your school will take in advance.</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Morweb_Noupe_School-Website-Best-Practices-Designing-for-Success_news-blog.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113360\" />\n</figure> \n<p>Going virtual doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice quality. In fact, it gives your educators the opportunity to completely rethink the learning experience for students. Encourage your faculty to keep the above in mind when developing assignments and other educational content. Explore the concept of shifting to online learning further with <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm91cGUuY29tL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL3R1dG9yaWFscy1pbnNwaXJhdGlvbi9lZHVjYXRpb25hbC10ZWNobm9sb2d5Lmh0bWw%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\">this educational technology guide</a> to make the most of virtual classrooms.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Morweb_Noupe_School-Website-Best-Practices-Designing-for-Success_Header-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113361\" />\n</figure> \n<h2>2. Create a well-organized navigation bar.</h2> \n<p>When you’ve taken the time to develop engaging content, you’ll want to ensure that your website visitors can find it. By developing a clear navigation bar, your audience will be able to locate whatever information is most relevant to their immediate needs. On the other hand, if they <em>can’t</em> find the desired information within a reasonable amount of time, they may become frustrated and leave your school’s website altogether.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Morweb_Noupe_School-Website-Best-Practices-Designing-for-Success_navigation-menu.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113362\" />\n</figure> \n<p>Consider your target audience. This likely includes your prospective students, your current students and staff members, and your alumni. When visiting your school’s website, these three groups have different intentions behind why they’re there. Because of this, it’s important to create the correct framework to help them find what they’re looking for. Let’s take a look at these three perspectives:</p> \n<ol>\n <li><strong>Prospective students:</strong> These individuals want to start with an overview of your school. This includes information such as its location and offered courses. From here, they may dive deeper to learn more about available programs and extracurricular activities. Otherwise, they may continue their search for education elsewhere.</li>\n <li><strong>Current students and staff members:</strong> This group is already familiar with your school, so you’ll need to take a slightly different approach for their experience with your navigation. These visitors will likely want to learn more about ongoing events (whether in-person or virtual), access a community program, or log into your student and faculty portal. This way, they can maximize their learning experience.</li>\n <li><strong>Alumni:</strong> For high schools and higher education institutions, individuals who have already graduated have a different set of needs altogether. They return to your school’s website looking to stay updated on any progress, engage in career networking opportunities, and possibly donate to their alma mater. Help them accomplish these goals by creating dedicated alumni pages, clear fundraising appeals, and accessible donation forms.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>From here, you’ll want to determine which information is most pertinent to each of these audiences, which will be used to form the information architecture within your navigation bar. Don’t include everything in your navigation bar, though. Instead, only feature your high-value pages, such as those discussed above.</p> \n<p>Often, you’ll see schools include button CTAs such as ‘Donate’ and ‘Enroll’ in the navigation bar as well. According to <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29hcGJveGVuZ2FnZS5jb20vYmxvZy8xODkxLWRvbmF0ZS1idXR0b24%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Soapbox Engage’s donate button guide</a>, each button’s design can play an important role in generating conversions, so take the necessary time to create a straightforward design that stands out. If your CMS offers it, you can include a search bar to help visitors navigate to your other content.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Overall, remember that your navigation bar will be visible across your entire website. Whether a visitor lands on your <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm91cGUuY29tL2Rlc2lnbi9ob21lcGFnZS1kZXNpZ24tcHJhY3RpY2VzLmh0bWw%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\">homepage</a> or a blog post, they should be able to quickly locate whatever they need using your navigation bar, whether it’s your donation form or information about upcoming events.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Morweb_Noupe_School-Website-Best-Practices-Designing-for-Success_Header-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113363\" />\n</figure> \n<h2>3. Offer straightforward forms.</h2> \n<p>Chances are, your school employs various types of forms, such as those for donations, health information, and applications. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9qb3Rmb3JtLmNvbQ%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\">online form builders</a>, you can now make yours available online. By placing these valuable resources directly on your school’s website, visitors will find them much easier to locate and will be able to fill them out without making an extra trip to your school. Not to mention, you won’t have to worry about organizing this data on your own later on.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Morweb_Noupe_School-Website-Best-Practices-Designing-for-Success_donation-form.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113364\" />\n</figure> \n<p><strong>Forms that are difficult to locate and navigate will turn users away.</strong> Instead, make sure they’re user-friendly, so you can effectively drive people through the process. Keep these best practices in mind to <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm91cGUuY29tL2Rlc2lnbi81LXdlYi1kZXNpZ24tZWxlbWVudHMtdGhhdC1pbXByb3ZlLXVzZXItZXhwZXJpZW5jZS5odG1s&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\">improve the user experience</a> and boost form conversions:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Determine what information you’d like to collect. </strong>When someone clicks through to one of your forms (whether they’re looking to enroll, register for an event, or donate), dozens of fields will seem overwhelming. Then, they may choose to leave before ever starting. Instead, limit the number of fields to the basics. <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9yd2ViLm9yZy9Qb3N0L2RvbmF0aW9uLXBhZ2UtZGVzaWduLXRpcHMtZXhhbXBsZXM%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\">For your donation page design</a>, this means name, contact details, and payment information. Each additional field will give the visitor another chance to leave the process.</li>\n <li><strong>Make sure it’s mobile-responsive.</strong> In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9xdW9yYWNyZWF0aXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21vYmlsZS1tYXJrZXRpbmctc3RhdGlzdGljcw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">80% of online users</a> used a mobile device to search the internet, making it an important consideration in your school’s web design strategy. When it comes to your forms, each element (e.g. fields, images, text) should automatically resize itself based on the user’s screen size. This will make it easier for users to fill out the fields and complete the form on mobile devices, which is important since your students are primarily younger and rely heavily on mobile devices.</li>\n <li><strong>Brand it to your school.</strong> Sticking to the same font as well as two or three colors will make sure your forms are consistent with the rest of your website. You’ll want to include your school’s logo as well. These subtle elements can make a big difference in reminding users of why they’re there. If your forms look drastically different from the rest of your website, visitors may think they’ve somehow ended up on an untrustworthy third-party site.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>Once you’ve created <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam90Zm9ybS5jb20vZm9ybS1kZXNpZ24v&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113358\">well-designed forms</a>, you’ll want to ensure they’re visible across your school’s website. As we mentioned earlier, your high-value forms should be featured in your navigation bar for quick access.

When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.” — Lao Tzu</em></p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Konnichiwa, and welcome to the overview of the digital product design trend emphasizing the beauty of Japanese minimalism in the modern digital world. Here old art traditions combine with digital technologies, and the ancient stays side by side with innovation. This incredible cohesion of styles and technologies has given birth to a new trend in product user interface design — Japanese neo-minimalism. Let’s dive deeper into the history of the concept and see incredible samples of this style implemented in UI design for mobile apps and websites.</p> \n<h2>Minimalism Deep-Rooted in Japanese Art</h2> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-1024x769.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113117\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Illustration by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvOTM1OTczMy1Ja2lnYWk%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Ani Chitishvili</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>When thinking of minimalism, Japanese interior and graphic design are likely the first things coming to mind. Japanese minimalism takes roots in traditional Zen Buddhism aesthetics, the minimalist movement that carries the mission of keeping life simple and uncluttered by focusing on the bare essentials.</p> \n<p>At the heart of it is MA (lit., “gap”, “space”, “pause”), a Japanese cultural concept meaning the love to not things but space between them. It is all about the negative space, emptiness, and clearness. MA is usually considered as space where the absence of things means more than the presence of them. It is filled with nothing but energy and feeling. Ma means silence as opposed to sound and lack as opposed to excess.</p> \n<p>This concept moves us away from modern consumerism and helps re-connect with simplicity, naturalness, and functionality. It’s relished in interior design, architecture, art, music, and other Japanese life aspects. It has also become one of the most significant sources of inspiration for digital product creators worldwide. Today, you can see many examples of <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9maXJlYXJ0LnN0dWRpby9ibG9nLzUtcmVhc29ucy10by1hcHBseS1kaWdpdGFsLWlsbHVzdHJhdGlvbi1pbi13ZWItZGVzaWduLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">digital illustrations in web design</a> featuring Japanese minimalist aesthetics.</p> \n<h2>Principles of Japanese Minimalist Aesthetics in UI Design</h2> \n<p>Let’s think of Google. The world’s top brand has implemented all principles of Japanese minimalism in its memorable yet straightforward design. It is full of emptiness and meaning at the same time. It is clear and simple. It celebrates the beauty of contrast and bold typography. And it keeps a focus on the most important.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113118\" />\n</figure> \n<h3>The Use of Negative Space</h3> \n<p>In this case, negative is positive. The negative space (or white space) is the emptiness between elements in the user interface design. Modern brands leverage the power of negative space in web design and mobile app design to emphasize the importance of existing things. Using negative spaces helps avoid cognitive user overload and keep design intuitive.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The white space is a friend of user-friendliness in UI design for digital products. It allows emphasizing the most important and focusing attention on the essential content. By removing all the necessary things, we remain the most important and help the user easily find it in an interface. The most successful products are mostly easy-to-use, minimalist, and have a lot of negative space in the UI.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113119\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>UI App Animation by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvMTI2OTY4MDEt&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Movica</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113120\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>The concept for Sushi Delivery by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvMTM5OTEzMDctQ29uY2VwdC1mb3Itc3VzaGktZGVsaXZlcnk%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Yevhenia Tsmokalenko</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h3>Simplicity &amp; Clearness</h3> \n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n <p><em>“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.” — Steve Jobs</em></p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Simplicity is not only about how it looks but also how it functions. Let’s consider simplicity from the UX perspective. A simple user interface design empowers users to navigate between the web pages or app screens easily. It makes them enjoy interacting with the UI and gives them confidence that they can quickly accomplish tasks and goals they’re using your digital product for.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Japanese minimalism implies the absence of the cluttering details and decorations but keeping everything simple, elegant, strict, and clear. An excellent example of this is a mobile app design below.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113121\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Uniqlo E-Commerce App Animation by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvNDM2NjA3My1VbmlxbG8tRS1Db21tZXJjZS1BcHAtQW5pbWF0aW9u&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Michal Skvarenina</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h3>Contrast</h3> \n<p>Japanese minimalism is in love with the art of contrasts. Traditionally, it uses red &amp; white and white &amp; black combinations the most often. The frequent color combination is also red-blue-white. The monochromatic and high-contrast palette reveals the elegance of a digital product and gives it a fresh and modern look.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, high-contrast design increases the content readability and enables users to consume information more easily. The UI clarity, understandability, and ease of use are key goals of intelligent UX design, and a contrast color palette may help achieve them faster. The two examples below show how you can apply it to mobile app design.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113122\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Self-Motivation App by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vRmlyZWFydC1k&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Fireart Studio</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113123\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Design by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvNTU4Nzk5MS1UZWEtQnJlYWs%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Mathilde Glib</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h3>Dramatic Typography</h3> \n<p>We often associate the Japanese culture with Kanji, the adopted logographic Chinese characters used in the Japanese writing system. Inspired by Kanji’s distinguishable beauty, digital designers often create typography of a similar mood and look.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Japanese minimalism tends to use bold typography, and we can see the same tendency in the UI design of many new digital products. Large Japanese typography implemented in high-contrast palette creates a feeling of drama and intrigue. It helps shape an unforgettable online brand image and lasting impression from a website or mobile application. Are you looking to build a memorable brand for your digital product? Just try adding a bit of dramatism to its design by leveraging high-contrast color and bold typography, like Japanese art senseis have done it for their masterpieces.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113124\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Logo by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvNTg2OTIzOS05MC0xMDAtRGFpbHktU21hcnQtTG9nby1DaGFsbGVuZ2U%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Insigniada&nbsp;</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113125\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>UI Web Design by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vZHJld3Jpb3M%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Drew Rios</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113126\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Web Design for the Japanese Restaurant by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvMTIyMDUyMTUtSmFwYW5lc2UtUmVzdGF1cmFudA%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Sofia Pham</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h3>The Focus on Essentials</h3> \n<p>Japanese people are thought to be masters of concentration since all the local religious and philosophical movements say about the importance of this human ability. Are they? Probably, we’ll never know until visit Japan in reality. However, local art brightly demonstrates it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Japanese design is usually ultra-minimalist and focuses the viewer’s attention on one or several elements located in the center. There are no distracting details and unnecessary decorations in the user interface. This design is most often concentrated on the functionality first, and the visual part after. Mobile app designs presented below are great examples of this peculirity.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113127\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Signup Screen by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvNDUxNDM1NC1TaWduLXVw&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Oleg Frolov</em></a>\n  <br />\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/13.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113128\" />\n <figcaption>\n  <em>Sakana App by </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcmliYmJsZS5jb20vc2hvdHMvNjE5NjI3Mi1TYWthbmEtQXBwLUN1c3RvbS1UcmFuc2l0aW9ucw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113116\"><em>Yury Kirsanov</em></a>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h2>Less is More Today</h2> \n<p>Less is more. “More” may feel too cluttering and obtrusive for the user’s overloaded mind in the noisy modern world. Minimalism remains the optimal option for digital products. Rooting in Japanese culture and widely spread around the globe, the art of minimalism has conquered the hearts of millions of people today. It has become a continuous trend bringing a fresh look and ease of use to digital products. I hope that this article will help you reinforce your inner creative engine and inspire you to produce even more amazing minimalist designs for your next projects.<br /></p> \n<img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113116\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"display: none;\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:42:03 +0000","feedId":2999,"bgimg":"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-1-1.jpg","linkMd5":"6e8cc0db6bd98ad12c641342548403ee","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn9@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-51-38-079_d8dc462df098bc7d.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":471,"sourceBytes":38215,"destBytes":8216,"author":"Dana Kachan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-1-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn9@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-51-38-079_d8dc462df098bc7d.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-1024x769.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn93@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-51-40-409_e6b3f4fbea0c0d6f.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn45@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-51-47-672_79499f3c2458843f.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-51-47-763_6e4a434f67563000.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-1024x768.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn98@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-51-47-259_20f6b4c05f611392.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn57@2020_6/2020/08/24/15-52-05-826_cda7e0724fde94b0.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-1024x768.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn98@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-51-43-716_84f9aa1116ac8624.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn50@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-51-40-815_5e5a5785392a444f.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn29@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-51-40-280_7a8c4d6c8922dd3b.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn34@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-51-44-710_933c853a3de9e4f5.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/11.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn86@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-51-42-129_a89f362166ecb2a8.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn73@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-51-45-515_53daa8de9b419780.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/13.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-51-46-948_1589c240380419d0.webp","https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113116":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn5@2020_6/2020/08/24/15-51-41-667_3bcb6dd169df5180.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598284297220},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","title":"8 Project Management Tips for Your Next Web Development Project","link":"https://www.noupe.com/?p=113324","description":"<div>\n <img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" />\n</div> \n<p class=\"opener\">Here’s the thing: No matter how great your web development idea is, you are likely to fail without the right management system.</p> \n<p>To become a successful web developer, you need to be effective in managing your web development projects. Doing so allows you to deliver a project on time.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In case you are not aware, your revenues do not grow overnight. It would be best if you come up with the proper plan to execute your strategies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here are the eight project management tips that you can apply on your next web development project:</p> \n<h2>Create a detailed and actionable plan</h2> \n<p>The key to a successful project is breaking it up into smaller tasks.</p> \n<p>According to one episode of the <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJvamVjdC1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXBvZGNhc3QuY29tLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113324\">PM Podcast</a>, a project plan allows you to succeed. This is where Agile project management could come in handy.</p> \n<p>This project management approach provides you with a clear picture of what direction you are heading. It also gives you an insight into the impact of your actions, the risks involved, and how this will help you.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It also has four primary components:</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Why or the Project Vision</li>\n <li>What or the Project Mission</li>\n <li>Who or your team members</li>\n <li>Success Criteria&nbsp;</li>\n</ul> \n<h2>Get to know your team</h2> \n<p>It is common to work with a team when doing a web development project. Your team is composed of developers and designers who you rely on to complete a project.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Your team will be the one who will take your project from start to finish.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Team members that work with one another are the most effective. So, you need to invest your time getting to know them. This includes understanding their workflows, personalities, usual schedule, and so on.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Doing so allows you to communicate effectively with them. And when it is easy for you to establish communication, you can plan and organize tasks, set milestones, and enjoy working with your team.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Organize a kickoff meeting</h2> \n<p>A meeting aims to create a foundation for your project. It’s also a fantastic opportunity for you to inspire and energize your team.</p> \n<p>The main goal of having a kickoff meeting is to align everyone in your team with your main project objectives. This is also a great time to discuss any misunderstandings or problems with your project.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>During the meeting, you should <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ViZnguY29tL2Jsb2cvd2ViLWRlc2lnbi93ZWItZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQta2lja29mZi1tZWV0aW5nLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113324\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">discuss your project’s primary purpose</a> with your team. This includes the essential success factors, goals, deliverables, start and end date, your project or communication plans, and so much more.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Invest in a reliable project management software</h2> \n<p>To make your project management tasks run smoothly, you should create a centralized source of information that your team can access anytime.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This also makes communication with everyone in your team a lot easier.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A great solution to this is to research a <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVld2l0cy5jb20vd2ViLWRlc2lnbi1wcm9qZWN0LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc29mdHdhcmUv&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113324\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">great project management software</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Project management software allows your team to stay connected as you work on a project. This helps avoid any unnecessary confusion and enables you to get things done a lot quicker.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Create a hub for organizing everything</h2> \n<p>If you’re working on a web development project, it is not surprising that you will need documentation. That’s because your documentation can only help you <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2l0ZXBvaW50LmNvbS9vcmdhbml6ZS1wcm9qZWN0LWZpbGVzLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113324\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">organize it well</a>, and it’s easy to locate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That’s why you need to use a tool that will allow sub-folders and let you house various assets, like Dropbox and Google Drive.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You can visit this weekly to help you organize folders as you create new documentation, allowing any member of your team to navigate them with ease.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you’re using JIRA or Trello, use quick links on the documentation stored on this hub. You can also create a shared document with quick links that store things like designs, notes, and wireframes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Doing so allows you to access the whole project easily. Remember, what’s crucial to the design team may not be as essential to the development team. Thus, you might need to create different versions of this project document.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Communicate with your team</h2> \n<p>It would help if you communicated your needs and expectations to your designers and developers. Although this might be challenging since project managers, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/design/web-developer-portfolio-examples.html\">web developers</a>, and designers come from different spectrums.</p> \n<p>Project managers are often known to be the “idea people,” while developers and designers are more on the technical side.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That’s why you need to focus on communicating the right idea and paint a clear picture of the type of software solution that you want developers and designers to build.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Come up with a risk management plan</h2> \n<p>Risks can hurt the success of your project. That’s why you need to know the risks that can come up early on.</p> \n<p>The key here is to anticipate the risks that can happen and how it can impact your web development project.</p> \n<p>High impact risks are usually the most severe. Meanwhile, low or unlikely chances can post the least threat.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It would be ideal for creating a <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9ydWJ5Z2FyYWdlLm9yZy9ibG9nL3Jpc2stbWFuYWdlbWVudC1pbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudA%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113324\">risk mitigation plan</a>. Doing so allows you to decrease the impact of a risk or prevent it from happening. You can start with the high impact risks and deal with the medium and low threats a little later.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It also helps that you regularly review these risks, and then add new ones later.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Focus on one milestone at a time</h2> \n<p>While it can be easy to get ahead of yourself, especially if the project is successful in the early stages, this can be damaging in the long run.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Think about it- you can’t come up with seating for your restaurant if you don’t create a kitchen first. Similarly, you shouldn’t develop the frontend of your software if your backend is missing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The key here is to achieve one milestone at a time. Slow and steady wins the race. Start by making small goals while you stay focused on the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Remember that web projects are not easy. But it does not mean that they can’t be fun and rewarding. It may be daunting at first, but with the right strategies and tools, you will end up a winner in the long run.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly91bnNwbGFzaC5jb20vQGFsdmFyb3JkZXNpZ24%2FdXRtX3NvdXJjZT11bnNwbGFzaCZhbXA7dXRtX21lZGl1bT1yZWZlcnJhbCZhbXA7dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9Y3JlZGl0Q29weVRleHQ%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113324\"><em>Alvaro Reyes</em></a><em> on </em><a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly91bnNwbGFzaC5jb20vP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dW5zcGxhc2gmYW1wO3V0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmYW1wO3V0bV9jb250ZW50PWNyZWRpdENvcHlUZXh0&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113324\"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p> \n<img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113324\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"display: none;\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 11:07:15 +0000","feedId":2999,"bgimg":"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash-1024x683.jpg","linkMd5":"3128737438471239c22091c7499bb385","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn2@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-51-38-911_f7bfa38c06c32592.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":683,"sourceBytes":265308,"destBytes":42736,"author":"Andi Croft","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash-1024x683.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn2@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-51-38-911_f7bfa38c06c32592.webp","https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113324":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn86@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-51-40-660_8c3a3ae0a805e0a9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598284297208},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","title":"Cues to Master Drawings of People","link":"https://www.noupe.com/?p=113332","description":"<div>\n <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BvgAmfNCEAE0F8B.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"eye drawing with tears\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" />\n</div> \n<p class=\"opener\">For artists who are just beginning to draw people portraits, it may seem quite intimidating.</p> \n<p>In principle, the time you spend on drawings of people is directly parallel to the degree of life-likeness of your creation. As you devote more hours to a drawing you can naturally dive deeper into details and use your brush or pencil in a more cautious manner. </p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/minutes-1.jpg\" alt=\"eye drawing\" class=\"wp-image-113349\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Just like anything that needs some experience, mastering drawings of people takes time and only gets better when you practice enough in the long run. Refining your craft is not limited to the amount of practice only, there are some tips and tricks that will help you get there faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Don’t forget that there are countless different ways to draw people, so it is important to develop your own by combining these best practices.</p> \n<h3><strong>Study face proportions carefully</strong></h3> \n<p>Face proportions can make or break your drawing. This fundamentally important factor is quite hard to achieve. However, it is the structure of your drawing so you have to get it right.<br /><br />A face that is oddly proportioned will look wrong and disturb anyone who looks at it. That is why you have to pay close attention to the distance between eyes, ears, nose, and mouth and their general ratio on the face in order to please the eyes. </p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/proportions.jpg\" alt=\"facial proportions\" class=\"wp-image-113354\" />\n</figure> \n<h3><strong>Understanding the bone structure&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>Scaling<strong> </strong>the ratio of facial bones, the length of the chin, forehead, and the width of the face, cheekbone alignment is also difficult to get it straight. When you are drawing a face from scratch, careful examination of the relationship between key facial features will lead to more realistic drawings.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bone.jpg\" alt=\"drawings of different kinds of noses\" class=\"wp-image-113340\" width=\"572\" height=\"786\" />\n <figcaption>\n  by Giovanni Civardi\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Focusing on one feature at a time will help you read the facial anatomy more carefully. After you dig out which details to look for you will intuitively know how to capture these lines in your drawing.</p> \n<h3><strong>Use shadows for maximum impact </strong></h3> \n<p>Getting the face proportions and bone structure right is important. However, it is not enough to make your artwork look three dimensional and realistic. That’s when the shadows come into the light. Talk about a bad pun! Joking aside, shadows and shades will save your drawing from looking just flat.&nbsp; </p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_5596.jpg\" alt=\"process of shading an eye drawing\" class=\"wp-image-113339\" width=\"562\" height=\"764\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>First, you need to understand how lighting works in order to reach the ultimate level of mastering drawings of people. Creating the illusion of flow by skillfully acquiring basic lighting and shading techniques will help you discern the primary characteristics of the natural human form.</p> \n<h3><strong>The bigger, the better</strong></h3> \n<p>When you look at realistic drawings of people, you will realize that usually using paper or a canvas of a bigger dimension results in hyper-realistic artworks.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arms.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113351\" width=\"594\" height=\"702\" />\n</figure> \n<p>You can fit a head both into a letter-sized paper or an A1 paper. However, the amount of details that you can include while drawing on a smaller canvas is limited.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eyebrows.jpg\" alt=\"drawings of eyes\" class=\"wp-image-113346\" width=\"592\" height=\"1051\" />\n <figcaption>\n  by Nadia Coolrista\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>On a smaller paper, you cannot draw skin pores, or let’s say 150 eyebrow hair in a way that turns your creation into a realistically rendered one. This doesn’t mean that a smaller drawing is not a success however it certainly limits your capacity and talent.</p> \n<h4>Now it’s time to take a look at some successful examples of drawings of people to better understand which areas to focus on:</h4> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/drawing.jpg\" alt=\"eye drawing\" class=\"wp-image-113335\" width=\"591\" height=\"1050\" />\n <figcaption>\n  by Carrie Stuart Parks\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dreameraddict.jpg\" alt=\"girl drawing\" class=\"wp-image-113336\" width=\"579\" height=\"705\" />\n <figcaption>\n  by Dreamer Addict\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/male-face.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113353\" width=\"586\" height=\"733\" />\n <figcaption>\n  by Ani Cinski\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NIL-Tech.jpg\" alt=\"girl drawing 2\" class=\"wp-image-113337\" width=\"590\" height=\"743\" />\n</figure> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/e793893c17c97b5248eb105c3d8be4e7.jpg\" alt=\"lip drawings\" class=\"wp-image-113338\" width=\"592\" height=\"871\" />\n</figure> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/old-man.jpg\" alt=\"old man portrait\" class=\"wp-image-113355\" width=\"551\" height=\"726\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8eef6653f319edf2f7ffd3b9d44d596e.jpg\" alt=\"a portrait drawing of a girl\" class=\"wp-image-113341\" width=\"515\" height=\"801\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   by AaronGriffinArt\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0fe58c3b34c0a0734b64fedec7019c19.jpg\" alt=\"eye drawings\" class=\"wp-image-113343\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-21-at-15.17.10-953x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113348\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   by Gabriel Vinicius\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Knowing the human body and face is the key to master drawings of people.

In fact, tattoos are deeply embedded in human history and play an important role in many cultures and traditions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The oldest evidence that tattooing existed comes from the Upper Paleolithic period in Europe, where there are tools that signal people got inked 40,000 years ago. The earliest solid proof is found on Otzi the Iceman, who lived somewhere between 3300-3100 BC.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So, in this article, we wanted to go over some of the traditional tattoo styles that still endure to this day. We’ve searched far and wide to find the best examples of each. It’s important to remember that, when people refer to traditional tattoos, they are usually talking about traditional American tattoos, but we thought that it wouldn’t do justice to other traditional tattoo styles.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So in this article, we’ll be going over Japanese tattoos, Nordic tattoos, Polynesian tattoos, and traditional American tattoos.&nbsp; So, without too much delay, let’s get right into it.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>American Traditional Tattoos</strong></h2> \n<p>While we’re not a huge fan of traditional American tattoos, their popularity cannot be denied. Traditional American tattoos are defined by their symbolism and bright colors. They are usually rather small tattoos but there are larger versions or combinations of various different designs. </p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter\">\n  <img

Inking has been outlawed for the last 200 years but still, people carry the vibrant and iconic Japanese style tattoos all over their bodies proudly. Tattooing in Japan has been carried mostly by underground artists, or a rare few who had a medical license to do so. Traditional Japanese tattoos include cultural symbols, a vibrant color palette, and are usually large tattoos that can cover an entire limb or even the whole body. Most iconic designs usually include the Koi fish, dragons, tigers, oni (Japanese devils), and Lotus themed designs. </p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img

The Polynesian triangle is the home of many island tribes such as the Samoans, Hawaiians, the Maori, Tahitians, Cook Islanders, Marquesans, and Tongans. While there are slight cultural variations between tribes such as some variances in languages, inking remains a central and irreplaceable aspect of all Polynesian cultures. In fact, it was so important that tribe members who shied away from getting inked were shunned from the community and people who had incomplete tattoos would carry them as a reminder of their weakness for the rest of their lives. Traditional Polynesian tattoos are a bit different than the rest of the tattoo traditions on this article and don’t fall under tribal tattoos as their symbolism comes from patterns and the body parts they are inked on. A tattoo that is on the chest or arm means something entirely different than a tattoo on the lower body even if the designs might seem similar. </p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure

used and the symbolism behind them. The intricate nordic themed patterns woven together with mythological signs make up for great tattoos that both are good looking and hold meanings behind them. </p> \n<figure

consistent improvement and emphasis at each phase of the task. It starts with clients laying out how the finished result will be utilized and what issue it will resolve.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is Scrum?</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113305\" />\n</figure> \n<ol>\n <li>Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and one of the most widely used one.</li>\n <li>It’s not a process or methodology.</li>\n <li>Easy to understand.</li>\n <li>Based on Empiricism which means that scrum artifacts should be transparent to everyone in the team.</li>\n</ol> \n<h2><strong>Principles of Agile</strong></h2> \n<ol>\n <li>To fulfil the client through right on time and continuous use of important software.</li>\n <li>To cater to changing requirements, even late in <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbnRlcnByaXNlLmFmZmxlLmNvbS9tb2JpbGUtYXBwLWRldmVsb3BtZW50&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113299\">app development</a>.</li>\n <li>Delivering working software frequently.</li>\n <li>Stakeholders work with the scrum team together throughout the project so as to avoid any communication gaps.</li>\n <li>The most efficient way of communicating information within the team is face-to-face conversation.</li>\n <li>The progress of work is measured by working software.</li>\n <li>Continuous attention is paid to technical excellence.</li>\n <li>Due to the self-organizational team structure, the best architectures, designs, and ideas come up.</li>\n</ol> \n<h2><strong>Empiricism</strong></h2> \n<ol>\n <li><strong>Transparency:-</strong> All artifacts of the process should be visible to the stakeholders and the scrum team. Due to transparency, they can inspect the current state of the project and take necessary action if needed.</li>\n <li><strong>Inspection:-</strong> Having regular inspections of artifacts will help the stakeholders to incorporate changes in order to achieve the goal.</li>\n <li><strong>Adaptation:-</strong> Improvements can be made by adjusting the process based on the inspection results.</li>\n</ol> \n<h2><strong>Scrum is Iterative and Incremental</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image5-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113300\" />\n</figure> \n<p><strong><em>First one – Incremental</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Second one – Iterative</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Incremental:-</strong> This type of development is to build small increments of the entire product. Each increment adds more features to the product. After multiple increments, you will get the complete product.</p> \n<p><strong>Iterative:- </strong>This development is to build something, take some <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/constructive-feedback.html\">feedback</a>, and then refining to make it better. This will keep happening until we receive the product of good quality.</p> \n<h2><strong>The Scrum Team:</strong></h2> \n<ol>\n <li>The Product Owner.</li>\n <li>The Development Team.</li>\n <li>The Scrum Master.</li>\n</ol> \n<h2><strong>The Product Owner</strong></h2> \n<p>The product owner is liable for augmenting the estimation of the product and work of the development group.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image1-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113301\" />\n</figure> \n<ol>\n <li>Clearly describing the Product backlog items.</li>\n <li>Responsible for managing the product backlog.</li>\n <li>To ensure the PBI is visible and clear to all.</li>\n <li>To ensure the requirement is understood by all to the level it is required.</li>\n <li>Accountable for building high-value products.</li>\n <li>Ordering of Product backlog items to achieve the best goals.</li>\n <li>Responsible for understanding and answering all questions pertaining to the product domain.</li>\n <li>Responsible for tracking the release progress.</li>\n <li>Liable for making and dealing with the release plans.</li>\n <li>Liable for making and building up the product vision.</li>\n <li>Enhancing the estimation of work done by the development team.</li>\n</ol> \n<h2><strong>The Development Team</strong></h2> \n<p>The Development Team comprises experts who accomplish crafted by conveying a conceivably releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint.</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Cross-functional and self-organizing.</li>\n <li>Participates in all scrum events.</li>\n <li>Responsible for creating the product increment.</li>\n <li>Collaborates with the Product Owner for optimal value.</li>\n <li>Responsible for identifying and eliminating technical debts.</li>\n <li>Liable for creating and coordinating the sprint backlog.</li>\n <li>Responsible for implementing good engineering practices.</li>\n <li>Helps product owners in backlog management by explaining the technical constraints.</li>\n <li>Answerable for learning all the functions required to convey a product increment.</li>\n <li>Answerable for following the advancement of the sprint.</li>\n</ol> \n<h2><strong>The Scrum Master:</strong></h2> \n<p>The scrum master is responsible for ensuring that Scrum is understood and enacted by all. He ensures that the scrum team adheres to Scrum practices and rules.</p> \n<ol>\n <li>He is a servant- leader to the scrum team.</li>\n <li>Responsible for building the product fast by eliminating impediments.</li>\n <li>Goes about as a change agent that builds the <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/inspiration/productivity-the-ultimate-guide.html\">productivity</a> of the scrum team.</li>\n <li>Mentors the development team for self-organization and cross-functionality.</li>\n <li>Helps the product owners prioritize the work and teaches stakeholders value-based prioritization.</li>\n <li>Facilitates Scrum events as requested or required.</li>\n <li>Finds and teaches techniques for effective product backlog management to the product owners.</li>\n <li>Enables workers and partners of the association to comprehend and institute Scrum and experimental product development.</li>\n <li>Assists with streamlining the outside connection with the scrum group to amplify the value created.</li>\n</ol> \n<h2><strong>Scrum Events</strong></h2> \n<p>All occasions are time-boxed occasions, with the end goal that each occasion has a maximum duration. When a Sprint starts, its span is fixed and can’t be abbreviated or extended.</p> \n<p>The remainder of the events may end at whatever point the explanation behind the event is accomplished, ensuring an appropriate proportion of time is spent without allowing waste at the same time.</p> \n<h2><strong>The Sprint</strong></h2> \n<p>The core of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, usable, and possibly releasable product Increment is made.</p> \n<ol>\n <li><strong>Sprint Planning:- </strong>&nbsp;A time-boxed event that occurs at the beginning of every sprint where the team determines the product backlog items they will work on during the sprint.</li>\n <li><strong>Daily Scrum:-</strong> It’s a brief time-boxed occasion for the development group to synchronize exercises and make an arrangement for the following 24 hours.</li>\n <li><strong>Sprint Review:- </strong>This is again a time-boxed event that occurs at the end of every sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed.</li>\n <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:-</strong> This occasion gives a chance to the team to review itself and make an arrangement for enhancements to be done in the following sprint</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113302\" />\n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Scrum Artifacts</strong></h2> \n<p>Scrum Artifacts speak to work or incentive to give transparency and chances to investigation and transformation. Artifacts have been planned with a reason that everyone has a similar comprehension of the artifact.</p> \n<ol>\n <li><strong>Product Backlog:-</strong> An arranged rundown of everything that may be required in the product which is the single wellspring of necessities for any progressions to be made to the item. The Product Owner is liable for the Product Backlog, including its content, accessibility, and ordering.</li>\n <li><strong>Sprint Backlog:-</strong> The arrangement of Product Backlog things chose for the Sprint alongside an arrangement for conveying the item increase and understanding the run objective.</li>\n <li><strong>Product Increment:-</strong> The whole of all the Product Backlog things finished during a Sprint and the estimation of the additions of every past Sprint is called item increase.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Product Backlog Refinement:-</strong> The ongoing product backlog refinement takes place within each sprint to refine items to be ready for future sprints.</li>\n</ol> \n<h2><strong>Scrum Values</strong></h2> \n<ol>\n <li><strong>Commitment:-</strong> It is a team activity where you and your team are accountable to work together and confirm your team commitments. The scrum teams must be committed to progress and stick to the goal of the project.</li>\n <li><strong>Focus:-</strong> Once the requirements are clear and the target is set, one should be goal-oriented which motivates you for delivering faster and better.</li>\n <li><strong>Openness:-</strong> Colleagues ought to be open about their work, progress, what they realized and the issues they are confronting. Additionally, you ought to be available to work with partners, perceiving people to be people, and not resources, robots, or replaceable bits of equipment.</li>\n <li><strong>Respect:-</strong> As a piece of the Scrum group, you should regard partners, their choices, and their experience. You should regard your partners by not building anything in which individuals are not intrigued.

In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2Vic2l0ZXBsYW5ldC5jb20vYmxvZy9mcmVlbGFuY2Utc3RhdHMv&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113101\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">35% of Americans were working as freelancers</a>, up by 7 percent since 2013. 28% of Americans were doing this full-time, which is up by 17% from 2014.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All this to say, if you’re interested in becoming a freelance software developer, you’ve chosen an interesting time to do it. Demand is high for software developers, but you’ll also have plenty of competition in the freelancing space. To succeed, you’ll need to market yourself effectively and stand out from the crowd.</p> \n<h2>Identify Your Audience</h2> \n<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is narrow down your audience. As a software developer, you could work for practically any industry. However, if you try to market yourself to all of them, you’ll have a harder time making a name for yourself. Instead, you should focus on a specific niche and build your marketing strategy around them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are a few things you can do to narrow down your audience. First, look at your past clients if you have any. In what niches have you produced your best work? Having some strong examples of your past work in a niche will give your marketing efforts an immediate boost.</p> \n<p>You can also think about where your own interests lie. What are your own passions? For example, if you’re someone who likes to spend your free time at the gym, the audience you target could be businesses in the health and wellness industry. By targeting an audience you’re familiar with, you’ll be able to speak their language and you’ll have more passion for the projects.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Change Your Mindset</h2> \n<p>The next thing to work on is changing your mindset. Too many freelancers find themselves in an employee mindset. The result is that they end up taking any work they can get at any price. When you’re a freelancer though, you’re not an employee – you are your own business.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When you think about your relationship with your clients, do you find yourself thinking that you work “for” them or “with” them? If it’s the former, you’ll want to shift your mindset to the latter. Start thinking of yourself as a business that is offering its services to another business. You should focus on changing your mindset from the start, as it will end up impacting how you market yourself to the world in the subtlest of ways.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Establish Your Credentials</h2> \n<p>Credentials are a big reason why anyone will hire you. Most businesses won’t take a chance on freelancers who cannot demonstrate their expertise, especially when it comes to large and important projects like software development. Working as a freelancer is all about establishing trust with prospective clients, and to do this you need to have some credentials.</p> \n<p>Start with your professional credentials. If you have a degree in software development, you’re off to a great start. Another thing you can get is certifications related to software development – <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9jb21wdXRlcnNjaWVuY2Vtcy5jb20vcmVzb3VyY2VzL2NvbXB1dGVyLXNjaWVuY2UvdG9wLWNlcnRpZmljYXRpb25zLWZvci1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113101\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here are some good ones to consider</a>. Other things you can use as professional credentials are previous customer testimonials and examples of your work. The more evidence you can provide of your software development proficiency, the better.</p> \n<p>After that, focus on your personal credentials. Landing clients is about more than having a good resume. You also need to be someone that your clients enjoy working with. In every interaction with your audience – including emails, your website, and social media – you need to display your positive, authoritative, and trustworthy personality. When you’re responding to an email from, or on the phone with, a potential client it may not feel like you’re still marketing yourself, but you are.</p> \n<h2>Create an Online Presence</h2> \n<p>With all of this groundwork laid, now it’s time to create your online presence. It will do a lot of marketing for you, so you should give it plenty of attention.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>A Website</h3> \n<p>The most obvious place to start is with a website. A website is where prospective clients can come to learn about you and where you can display your best, most professional self.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unless you’re an excellent web designer, hire someone to create a website for you. If money is tight, look for some <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmFtZXNpbG8uY29tLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113101\">cheap domain names</a> to help offset the cost. A great website goes a long way though, so put as much into it as you can.</p> \n<h3>Social Media</h3> \n<p>Besides a website, you’ll also want a strong <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/social-media/social-media-presence.html\">social media presence</a>. You should have accounts on the largest social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Once you’re set up, make sure you use these accounts regularly. Always act professional, but allow your personality to shine through as well. Talk about things related to your niche and showcase your latest work. When someone finds your social media profile, this will be their first impression of you, so make it a good one.</p> \n<h3>Freelancing Websites</h3> \n<p>Lastly, you can establish yourself on freelancing websites. You can use sites like Upwork or Freelancer to create a professional profile and find clients who might need your services. You can also use sites that are specifically for finding software developers, such as Codementor. By creating an account on Codementor you can begin to attract some clients when you’re first starting out and build out your profile. For more information on this site, you can read this <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYW5jZXJyZXZpZXcuY29tL3Jldmlldy9jb2RlbWVudG9y&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113101\">Codementor review</a>.</p> \n<h2>Make Connections</h2> \n<p>Finally, you should focus on making connections with others, and here are a few easy ways to do this:</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Look for networking events in your area where your audience might be attending</li>\n <li>Find some online groups you can join to discuss software development or the niche you’re targeting</li>\n <li>Whenever you meet someone new, be sure to mention what it is you do for a living</li>\n <li>Ask past or current clients to refer you to anyone looking for a software developer</li>\n</ul> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unsplash-7rXu_HJO9D8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-113106\" />\n</figure> \n<p>You’d be surprised at how much work can come your way just by making a simple connection with someone. <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/business-online/word-of-mouth.html\">Word of mouth</a> and previous clients combine for <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2Vic2l0ZXBsYW5ldC5jb20vYmxvZy9mcmVlbGFuY2Utc3RhdHM%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113101\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">79 percent</a> of how most freelancers find new work, so start connecting with as many new people as you can.</p> \n<p>Once you make these connections, you’ll need to nurture them. Everyone you meet won’t be ready to become a client 10 minutes later. The best thing you can do is simply let everyone know what value you provide, then let them come to you. If you are too pushy with your sales tactics, it will likely turn people away. <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmh1YnNwb3QuY29tL21hcmtldGluZy83LWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1sZWFkLW51cnR1cmluZy10YWN0aWNz&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113101\">This guide</a> provides some additional tips on how you can nurture your leads.</p> \n<h2>Get Started with Your Freelance Software Developer Career</h2> \n<p>A lot of freelancers hate the marketing aspect of their business. This often happens because they are not doing it right. When done correctly, marketing yourself should be an enjoyable experience, as it allows you to make meaningful connections and help others using your skills and experience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Both the need for software developers and the popularity of working as a freelancer will continue to rise in the coming years. If this is something you’ve been considering, there’s no better time than the present. Start laying a solid foundation by picking your target audience and changing your mindset.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After that, it’s just a matter of making connections and showcasing your unique strengths. It may take some time for your marketing strategy to pick up steam, but once in place, you’ll have more clients than you know what to do with.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly91bnNwbGFzaC5jb20vQHBlcmxvb3Y%2FdXRtX3NvdXJjZT11bnNwbGFzaCZhbXA7dXRtX21lZGl1bT1yZWZlcnJhbCZhbXA7dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9Y3JlZGl0Q29weVRleHQ%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113101\"><em>Per Lööv</em></a><em> on </em><a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly91bnNwbGFzaC5jb20vP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dW5zcGxhc2gmYW1wO3V0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmYW1wO3V0bV9jb250ZW50PWNyZWRpdENvcHlUZXh0&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113101\"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p> \n<img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113101\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"display: none;\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 16:12:05 +0000","feedId":2999,"bgimg":"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/per-loov-_1Z4zsEXUSk-unsplash-1024x768.jpg","linkMd5":"8df9ed697dbf73b29417b39032ced027","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-51-38-905_536207402016c916.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":768,"sourceBytes":325957,"destBytes":56250,"author":"David Schneider","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/per-loov-_1Z4zsEXUSk-unsplash-1024x768.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-51-38-905_536207402016c916.webp","https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unsplash-7rXu_HJO9D8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn90@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-51-42-188_91b27bee03764e50.webp","https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-post-id=113101":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn98@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-51-40-253_aac988dc73deed9a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598284297220},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:51:37","title":"How to Convert PDF Files to Other Formats?","link":"https://www.noupe.com/?p=113275","description":"<div>\n <img width=\"825\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.noupe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/convert-pdf-pillar-FCBF57.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" />\n</div> \n<p class=\"opener\">Working with a PDF document can be significantly easier and more convenient that working with an original document created in a program such as Microsoft Word.</p> \n<p>If you’re working in the legal profession, and you need to exchange documents with clients or other lawyers, a PDF provides several advantages. For example, for a digital document to be admissible in court, that document needs to be in a format that cannot be altered without leaving a digital record of what changes were made. </p> \n<p>The human resources department of any company provides prospective and current employees with a variety of documents, forms, and other paperwork. Additionally, a business can create brochures, training manuals or even invoices and forward a PDF file. While the original source document may have been created in Microsoft Word, it’s far more efficient to send copies as a PDF file. This eliminates compatibility issues that may arise due to different versions of Word, missing fonts or different operating systems, such as Mac or Windows, or iOS and Android.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter\">\n  <img src=\"https://cms.jotform.com/uploads/image_upload/image_upload/annabel/67490_tyler-franta-589346-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Here’s five reasons why you should distribute PDF documents rather than an original.</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Retain formatting. You may be using special fonts and formatting. </li>\n <li>Platform agnostic. PDF can be read on any device and operating system, including mobile and tablets.</li>\n <li>Security. You may want people to only read your document, and not change the content of your PDF. Plus, you can easily password-protect a PDF document.</li>\n <li>Multiple versions of software. People receiving your document may not have the latest version of Microsoft Word, which means it’s possible the document can’t be accessed. This isn’t an issue when using PDF.</li>\n <li>Free PDF readers. There’s a wide-variety of free PDF readers available for every operating system and platform. </li>\n</ol> \n<h3>How to Create a PDF on Mac</h3> \n<ol>\n <li>Open the document</li>\n <li>Select File &gt; Print</li>\n <li>Choose the PDF popup menu and select “Save as PDF”</li>\n <li>Choose a name and location for the PDF file. Enter the information you want in the Title, Author, Subject, and Keywords fields.</li>\n <li>Select Save</li>\n</ol> \n<p>Apple makes it very easy to create a PDF from any type of software program by mimicking the same steps you would take to print a document. The process is baked into the operating system. </p> \n<p>To create a PDF, just follow the steps provided above.</p> \n<h2>How to Convert PDF to Word – Word to PDF</h2> \n<h3>How to Convert PDF to Word</h3> \n<ol>\n <li>Open the file you want to convert in Acrobat.</li>\n <li>Click on the Export PDF tool in the right pane.</li>\n <li>Choose Microsoft Word as your export format.</li>\n <li>Click Convert.

Unfortunately, that’s labor intensive and might mess up the formatting.</p> \n<p>To retain the formatting, convert the PDF to a PowerPoint (PPTX) file. Adobe Acrobat Pro lets you convert all the pages of a PDF into PowerPoint quickly. Alternatively, you can export just the information you need.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Note that the Acrobat XI Standard has Microsoft Office conversion tools for Word and Excel, but you need the Pro version for PowerPoint. Also, this feature is not available in older versions of Adobe Acrobat.</p> \n<p>Here are the steps:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Open Adobe Acrobat, go to <strong>Tools, </strong>and<strong> </strong>then select <strong>Export PDF.</strong></li>\n <li>Choose <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint</strong> as your export format, select the PDF file that you want to export to PowerPoint, and then click the Export button.</li>\n <li>In the Save As window, name the PowerPoint file and save it to your desired location.</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/pdf_to_pptx.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3><strong>How to Convert</strong> <strong>Powerpoint (PPTX) to PDF</strong></h3> \n<p>Converting your PowerPoint slides into a PDF file is a quick way to produce a presentation that can be printed or shared. Share it with your clients so they can view the PowerPoint slides even if they don’t have Microsoft PowerPoint installed on their computer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"featured snippet\">With Microsoft PowerPoint, you can directly export the PowerPoint slides to PDF without losing the formatting.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To do that, follow these steps:</p> \n<ol>\n <p><li>Open Microsoft PowerPoint, and then select <strong>File</strong> <strong>Export</strong></li> </p>\n <p><li>Click <strong>Create PDF/XPS Document,</strong> and then click <strong>Create PDF/XPS.</strong><p></p></li></p> \n <p><li>In the <strong>Publish as PDF </strong>dialog box, choose a location to save the file.</li></p>\n</ol> \n<p>That’s it! The converted PDF should open automatically.

There’s absolutely no need to type text manually. Adobe Acrobat can convert PDF into plain text instantly and take care of the optical character recognition for you. You can edit the text, make further changes, or copy and paste text to any external apps.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Follow these steps:</p> \n<p>1. Open Adobe Acrobat, go to <strong>Tools, </strong>and<strong> </strong>then <strong>Export PDF.</strong></p> \n<p>2. Select <strong>More Formats </strong>and<strong> </strong>then <strong>Text (Plain).</strong></p> \n<p>3. Select the PDF file that you want to convert, and then click the <strong>Export </strong>button.</p> \n<p>4. Select the folder where you want to save the file.</p> \n<p>5. After conversion, the text should open in Notepad or your default text viewing application.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/05282019_Q8PZu8I4Zj.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3>How to Convert TXT to PDF</h3> \n<p>A text document has no formatting, such as italics, links, and bullets. If you need the text for complex purposes, you may want to convert it to a standard format like PDF.</p> \n<p>The easiest way to convert a text file to PDF is to create a PDF file using Adobe Acrobat.</p> \n<p>Follow these steps:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Open Adobe Acrobat.</li>\n <li>Click <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Create </strong>&gt; <strong>PDF From File.</strong></li>\n <li>Select the Text (TXT) file that you want to convert to a PDF.</li>\n <li>Save the PDF, and that’s it!</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/05282019_uwcwSnjMcT.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<div class=\"featured-snippet\"> \n <h3>How to Convert RTF to PDF</h3> \n <ol> \n  <li>Open your word processor software</li> \n  <li>Open the file</li> \n  <li>Click “Choose File” and “Print”</li> \n  <li>Choose Adobe PDF as the printer in the Print dialog box</li> \n  <li>Click Print</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich Text Format (RTF) is a proprietary</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">document file format that was created in the late 1980s by Microsoft. The purpose was to create a file standard so users could exchange Microsoft documents between Mac and Windows. &nbsp;Most word processing software can read and write some versions of RTF, however it’s not a perfect process.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of wrestling with RTF documents, it may be easier to send it as a PDF.</span></p> \n<h3><strong>How to convert</strong> <strong>PDF to ODT</strong></h3> \n<p>OpenDocument Text Document (.odt) are the files created by the free OpenOffice Writer word processor program. ODT files are very similar to the popular DOCX file format used with Microsoft Word.</p> \n<p>If you want the PDF to be opened on OpenOffice Writer, you need to convert the PDF to ODT or to any <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93aWtpLm9wZW5vZmZpY2Uub3JnL3dpa2kvRG9jdW1lbnRhdGlvbi9PT29BdXRob3JzX1VzZXJfTWFudWFsL0dldHRpbmdfU3RhcnRlZC9GaWxlX2Zvcm1hdHM%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113275\">document format that’s supported by OpenOffice Writer</a>. In this guide, we will tackle PDF to ODT conversion.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There’s no direct conversion of PDF to ODT using Adobe Acrobat. The best method is to convert a PDF to a Word document, and then save the Word document to OpenDocument format.</p> \n<p>Follow these steps:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Open <strong>Adobe Acrobat, </strong>and<strong> </strong>then go to <strong>Tools </strong>&gt; <strong>Export PDF.</strong></li>\n <li>Select <strong>Microsoft Word</strong> format, and then select the PDF file.</li>\n <li>Click the <strong>Export </strong>button, and then select the destination folder.</li>\n <li>After conversion, the file should automatically open in Microsoft Word. If not, open the converted file in Microsoft Word, and save it as <strong>OpenDocument</strong> (ODT).</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/pdf_to_odt.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3><strong>How to convert ODT to PDF</strong></h3> \n<p>OpenDocument Text (ODT) is the default format for OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice. If you want to share your file, ensure that it’s easily accessible on any device, and ensure the security of the content, consider converting it to PDF.</p> \n<p>You can convert ODT to PDF in seconds using Microsoft Word. Follow these three simple steps:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Open the<strong> OpenDocument Text</strong> (.odt) file in <strong>Microsoft Word.</strong></li>\n <li>Go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Export </strong>&gt; <strong>Create</strong> <strong>PDF/XPS Document</strong> &gt; <strong>Create</strong> <strong>PDF/XPS.</strong></li>\n <li>Select the destination folder, and then click the <strong>Publish </strong>button.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>The file will automatically open in your default PDF viewer. Here’s a visual guide:</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/odt_to_pdf.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3><strong>How to convert PDF to HTML</strong></h3> \n<p>How do you display the content of a PDF in all browsers without running into any compatibility issues? You can simply embed the PDF on your website, or you can convert the PDF to HTML. While the latter may not produce the cleanest result, you can customize the HTML.<br /></p> \n<p>For instance, if you want to convert a brochure that’s in PDF format into a website, but you don’t have strong design or development skills, converting your PDF to HTML might be the quickest solution.<br /></p> \n<p>We recommend using the Adobe Acrobat application for PDF to HTML conversion. In addition to flexibility and functionality, you will get the best results when you work with the app that created the PDF.<br /></p> \n<p>Follow these steps to convert a PDF to HTML using Adobe Acrobat: <br /></p> \n<ol>\n <li>Load your PDF into <strong>Adobe Acrobat,</strong> and then go to <strong>Tools.</strong></li>\n <li>Select <strong>Export PDF,</strong> then <strong>HTML Web Page.</strong></li>\n <li>Click the <strong>Export </strong>button, and then choose your file destination.</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/Convert_PDF_HTML_process.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<p>4. Preview the converted HTML.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://www.noupe.com/?p=113275/\thttps://shots.jotform.com/elton/Convert_PDF_HTML_view.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3><strong>How to Convert HTML To PDF</strong><br /></h3> \n<p>Converting the HTML from a web page into a PDF file is easy with Adobe Acrobat. The result behaves much like the original web page. The layout, formatting, images, and links — including CSS styles, HTML5 tags, and even JavaScript forms — are preserved. If the HTML contains a form, the form in the converted PDF will be submittable and will work the same way it does on the web page.<br /></p> \n<p>Follow these steps:<br /></p> \n<ol>\n <li>Open <strong>Adobe Acrobat,</strong> and then go to the <strong>Tools </strong>tab.</li>\n <li>Select <strong>Create PDF,</strong> <strong>Web Page,</strong> and then enter the website URL that you want to convert to PDF.</li>\n <li>Click the <strong>Create </strong>button.</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/convert_html_to_pdf_acrobat.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3>How to Convert <strong>PDF to XPS</strong></h3> \n<p>XPS (XML Paper Specification) is an alternative file format for PDF (Portable Document Format) that was developed by Microsoft. Like PDF, the XPS file format is also frequently used for final documents that need to be shared. Examples are contracts, financial reports, tax returns, resumes, flyers, and other legal documents.</p> \n<p>If you want a less expensive file format that’s compatible with Microsoft Office, consider using XPS instead of PDF. If you have Microsoft Office 2010 or newer, you can already open a PDF file directly in Microsoft Word and export it to XPS format. Follow these steps:&nbsp;</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Open Microsoft Word, and then go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Open.</strong> Browse to the PDF file that you want to convert to XPS.</li>\n <li>After the PDF loads in Microsoft Word, go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Export </strong>&gt; <strong>Create PDF/XPS Document </strong>&gt; <strong>Create PDF/XPS.</strong></li>\n <li>Select the folder where you want to save the file, and then change the format to <strong>XPS Document.</strong> You can rename the file if you want. Click the <strong>Publish </strong>button to save the XPS file.</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/xps_to_pdf.gif \" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3>How to Convert <strong>XPS to PDF</strong></h3> \n<p>If you prefer PDF over XPS, follow the steps below to convert XPS to PDF:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Open Microsoft Word, and then go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Open.</strong> Browse to the XPS file that you want to convert to PDF.</li>\n <li>After that, go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Print </strong>&gt; <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF.</strong></li>\n <li>Enter a name for your PDF, and then click the <strong>Print </strong>button to save the PDF file.</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/xps_to_pdf.gif \" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3>How to Convert <strong>PDF to DjVu</strong></h3> \n<p>DjVu file format has advanced compression technology intended for scanned images, similar to a PDF. A DjVu file can contain compressed yet very high-resolution images of scanned documents, digital documents, and photographs.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, DjVu format is not as widely supported as PDF. Adobe Acrobat does not export directly to this file format. The easiest and most convenient way to convert PDF to DjVu is through an online <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGp2dS1wZGYuY29tLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113275\">converter</a> that’s designed to convert PDF to DjVu and vice versa.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The guide is pretty straightforward. Here are the steps:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Go to <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGp2dS1wZGYuY29tLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113275\">https://www.djvu-pdf.com/</a>.</li>\n <li>Select the PDF to convert to DjVu. The conversion will automatically start and will redirect you to a download page afterward.</li>\n <li>Click the download link to download the DjVu file.</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/pdf_to_djvu.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure> \n<h3>How to Convert <strong>DjVu to PDF</strong></h3> \n<p>If you come across DjVu files and want to make them more useful, you can convert them to PDF. PDF is more widely known and supported than DjVu, and it’s easier to create and edit PDFs.</p> \n<p>To convert PDF to Djvu quickly, you can try one of the same online converter tools listed in the <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGp2dS1wZGYuY29tLw%3D%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113275\">PDF to DjVu guide</a>. However, the following process works better and retains the file’s formatting and quality.</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Download and install the light and open-source Djvu Viewer app, <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93aW5kanZpZXcuc291cmNlZm9yZ2UuaW8v&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113275\">WinDjView</a>.</li>\n <li>After installation, open WinDjView, and then go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Open.</strong> Browse to the DjVu file that you want to convert to PDF.</li>\n <li>Next, go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Print, </strong>and<strong> </strong>then select any PDF printer in the Printer list, e.g., <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF. (</strong>If you don’t have a printer installed, you can install this free <a href=\"https://www.noupe.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94aXRzb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20vcGRmLXJlYWRlci8%3D&amp;feed-stats-url-post-id=113275\">Foxit PDF Reader</a>, which adds a printer to the list.) Click the <strong>Print </strong>button to save the DjVu file as a PDF.</li>\n</ol> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <img src=\"https://shots.jotform.com/elton/djvu_to_pdf.gif\" alt=\"\"
