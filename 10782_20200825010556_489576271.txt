I&#8217;m also co-founder of a bar consulting and staffing company. I&#8217;m gradually taking over operations for my Dad&#8217;s auto parts business, and I do some marketing and automation consulting on the side.</p><p>In my downtime, I try to eat enough to stay alive.</p><p><strong><em>What is the backstory that ignited you to get started on becoming more productive?</em></strong></p><p>It isn&#8217;t so much a well-defined backstory as it is a tale of gradual self-awareness that, humorously, mirrors the stages of grief.</p><ol><li>Denial &#8211; I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;ll just work late. I&#8217;ll catch up on the weekend.</li><li>Anger &#8211; Why am I so busy but nothing gets done? I&#8217;m sick of running in place!</li><li>Bargaining &#8211; I&#8217;ll sell my soul for enough magic to tackle 1/2 of my to-do list overnight.</li><li>Depression &#8211; Maybe it&#8217;s me. Maybe I just don&#8217;t have the drive or focus of my peers. I can&#8217;t change the fact that I&#8217;m ADHD.</li><li>Acceptance &#8211; Maybe, just maybe, productivity is a skill that can be learned.</li></ol><p><em><strong>What was the wall or problem that you ran into that stopped you from accomplishing what you wanted?</strong></em></p><p>I identified with my khakis.</p><p><em><strong>What was the epiphany you experienced and discovered?</strong></em></p><p>&#8220;You are not the contents of your wallet. You are not your (expletive) khakis.&#8221; Ah &#8211; one of my all-time favorite quotes. While that Fight Club line is open to interpretation, to me, the obvious conclusion is that you shouldn&#8217;t build an identity based on material possessions.</p><p>Several years ago, in a completely unrelated conversation, I asked my friend Jessica about her work as a speech therapist. I used the phrase &#8220;autistic child&#8221;. She immediately corrected me. &#8220;We say a child with autism. You don&#8217;t define someone by their condition.</p><p>&#8220;The slight change of phrasing caught me off guard. The lightbulb went off. I began to see a deeper meaning in Fight Club. We&#8217;re not the collective sum of our possessions, nor are we defined by our condition in life. I realized that I defined myself by my ADHD and my seemingly inherent disorganization.</p><p><em><strong>What was the transformation that you experienced?</strong></em></p><p>I was freed from paralysis. 2 years ago I was wallowing in self-pity, largely living off my parents&#8217; generosity. Today I&#8217;m proud of starting 2 profitable businesses, proud to be able to continue my Dad&#8217;s business, and proud to have a day job with an incredible team. The best part? I do it all from home in my PJs.</p><p><em><strong>If you have one piece of productivity advice for someone who is struggling to make progress towards their goals, what would it be?</strong></em></p><p>Wherever you&#8217;re at just remember 1) productivity is a skill that can be learned and 2) you are not your khakis. You&#8217;re not defined or limited by your challenges or situation in life. What defines you is your ability to overcome those obstacles and make your dreams a reality. It all starts with your mindset. The rest can be taught.</p><p>Thank you, Branden, for sharing!</p><p>Branden is a great example of what we refer to in our community as a “productivity champ” — someone who continuously looks for ways to become better or someone who has a <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/171-growth-mindset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growth mindset</a>.

If you haven’t yet, make sure you complete <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-2-daily-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Day 2</a> to create the right mindset and environment for working from home.</p><p>Now that you’re set up, today’s challenge is all about making time to work on the important things you need to do. It’s not easy at the best of times, but it’s even more difficult when you’re at home!</p><h2>The Invisible Triggers</h2><p>You may not realize this, but when you go to work at an office, your day is filled with invisible triggers telling you that it is time to work.</p><p>Get in the car or on the train? Enter the building? Get in the elevator? Grab your hot beverage? Sit down at your desk and start up your computer?</p><p>All triggers that you are (or at least <em>should</em>) be switching from home mode to work mode.</p><p>Coworkers heading to the food court for lunch? Trigger for break mode.</p><p>Walking back into the building <em>after</em> lunch? Trigger to get back to work.</p><p>Time to catch your train home and coworkers packing up? Trigger to wrap it up and head home.</p><p>This can all go out the window when you work from home. You don’t have these built-in triggers and time buckets to get work done and make progress on projects and goals.</p><h2>The problem with working from home &#8211; distractions!</h2><p>Here are just a few things that are working against you when you work from home:</p><ul><li>Family members in the house with you</li><li>Laundry, dishes, and assorted housework you see when you walk through the house</li><li>People not understanding that you’re <em>working</em>, and not just on an enforced vacation</li><li>Random FaceTimes from out of town relatives stuck at home too</li><li>No coworkers around that can see your screen, so no extrinsic pressure not to slack off</li><li>All communication moved to Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. So your day becomes a never-ending barrage of coworker DMs, @mentions, and Zoom meetings</li></ul><p>If you don’t take proactive measures, your day can slip away from you. Sure, you’ve been busy, but what have you accomplished?</p><h2>Be intentional with your time</h2><p>The key is to be intentional with your time. To know what you should be working on today, and then making time to actually work on it. Then, you need to defend yourself against distractions during that time.</p><h3>Know what you should be working on</h3><p>If you’re not careful, you will end up spending your day putting out fires and dealing with whatever urgent issue has popped up this week.</p><p>Sure they’re urgent, but are they important?</p><p>What about the things that are important but aren’t screaming for your attention right now? Will you get to them “when you can?”</p><p>(Spoiler alert — that time will never come.)</p><p>If you’ve spent time reading the AE blog in the past, you’ll be familiar with this image, called <em>The Eisenhower Box</em> or <em>The Eisenhower Matrix</em>:</p> <figure><img src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eisenhowerbox.png\" /></figure><p>When you look at your week, the key is maximizing the time spent in the top-right of the matrix. To be working on things that are important, but not hugely urgent.</p><p>When you evaluate your week and your day, you want to try to prioritize those “important but not urgent” activities and create the time to do them consistently.</p><h3>Make time to work on your important activities</h3><p>Here’s how you make sure you have time for your important activities: put them on your calendar now, or when you are planning your week and your day.</p><p>These are called <strong>focus blocks</strong>.</p><p>Not just put them on your calendar, but do what you need to do to make sure that when the time comes, you stop what you are doing and switch over to your scheduled activity.</p><p>It can be tempting to not treat these focus blocks as “real” appointments, because they are appointments with yourself. If you skip the appointment, who is going to know?</p><p>As you practice keeping these focus blocks and treating them seriously, you’ll be building the muscle and creating a habit that says: the appointments I make with myself are the most important ones of the day.</p><p>Maybe you do this with alerts all over the place. Perhaps you do it with accountability — have a friend or colleague check in with you and see if you accomplished what you said you would. Do whatever you need to do.</p><p>Here’s an example: let’s say you have a focus block scheduled this morning to write an article about working at home and focus.</p><p>And let’s say (hypothetically *cough*) that a colleague pings you and asks you to review a PDF they made.</p><p>What do you do? You want to be helpful, and clearly, people are waiting for that PDF.</p><p>If writing that article is your important task for the day, and if you have time blocked off for it, then one approach is to say:</p><p>“I’m happy to review the PDF. But I’m tied up with something right now, but I’ll be able to get to it in an hour. Will that work?”</p><p>If an hour works, great. If not, they can hopefully get someone else to do it. If there is no one else, then you can decide whether you want to stick to your focus block (the ideal situation), or if you have to review it now (not perfect, but it happens sometimes!) At least then it is an intentional choice.</p><p><em>We have more strategies for dealing with distractions when working from home coming up in a new resource we’re building. If you want to hear more about that, make sure you enter your details in the box below if you haven’t already.</em></p><h2>Exercise</h2><ul><li>Look at your calendar for the rest of the week.</li><li>Put a focus block on the calendar of at least 30 minutes as soon as you can. Tomorrow is best.</li><li>Repeat for the rest of the week.</li><li>Let us know in the comments when you’re done!</li></ul><div class=\"post-optin-wrapper\"><div class=\"inline-fields short-fields feature optin-form text-center post-optin\"><h2>Enter the Work From Home Challenge Giveaway</h2><p>Get 5 daily emails about the Work From Home challenge and get a chance to win great prizes:</p><form class=\"km-optin\" data-location=\"post\" data-offer=\"\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://forms.ontraport.com/v2.4/form_processor.php\" method=\"post\"><fieldset> <input class=\"text-input\" type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Your First Name\" /> <input class=\"text-input\" type=\"email\" name=\"email\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Your Email Address\" /> <input class=\"text-input\" type=\"tel\" name=\"sms_number\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Phone (optional)\" /> <input class=\"submit-button optin-submit\" type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" value=\"Enter Now\" /></fieldset> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"uid\" value=\"p2c7816f158\" /></form></div></div> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 11:00:12 +0000","feedId":10782,"bgimg":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/focus-page.jpg","linkMd5":"ebed2ffc8045f629f5bf923a28a6cd2d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn78@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-11-304_c6a31ae7086aae7a.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":643,"sourceBytes":74195,"destBytes":26438,"author":"Brooks Duncan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/focus-page.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn78@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-11-304_c6a31ae7086aae7a.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eisenhowerbox.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn47@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-49-784_8662c55b1a696f3c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317508240},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","title":"Your GTD Weekly Review: Be Consistent And Achieve “Mind Like Water” Each Week (TPS311)","link":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/?p=16267","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10360\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TheProductivityShow_FB-e1482589435887.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"363\" /></p><p>If you&#8217;ve tried David Allen&#8217;s Getting Things Done methodology, you&#8217;ve probably run into this scenario: You start doing your Weekly Review, and then you miss one, and then you miss another one, and before you know it, things are starting to slip.</p><p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be that way — in this episode, we are going to talk about doing an effective and efficient Weekly Review, and we are going to talk about how to be CONSISTENT.

It&#8217;s true for us too. Our life&#8217;s story is made great by how we managed to pull ourselves up.</p><p>Talking about failures is not easy especially if it&#8217;s personal. It&#8217;s harder to talk about if you&#8217;ve not managed to rise above it. This is a topic that hits very close to home because I&#8217;ve had my share of failures to fill out an entire sheet of paper. Perhaps even more.</p><p>Whatever type of failure you go through, one thing is for certain&#8211;your initial feeling is that of helplessness and &#8220;oh sh*t&#8221; moments. There might have been times when you ended up just lying on your bed and just staring into open space and not being productive at all. I get it. I&#8217;ve been there more than once. You then experience a lul wherein you just don&#8217;t feel like doing anything. It&#8217;s normal. Give yourself that time. But do not dwell on that feeling for too long. You need to get yourself out of that rut and be better than yesterday.</p><p>Here in Asian Efficiency, we&#8217;ve helped over 13,000 people become productive but that didn&#8217;t happen overnight. It took us years to get to where we are and we&#8217;ve had our share of failures too. Over the years, we&#8217;ve learned, as a team, some strategies that you can also use to bounce back from failure. These are also strategies that we have personally used, not just in Asian Efficiency but also in our personal lives.</p><h2>What are failures?</h2><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16103 size-full\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-in-blue-and-brown-plaid-dress-shirt-touching-his-hair-897817.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5760\" height=\"3840\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-in-blue-and-brown-plaid-dress-shirt-touching-his-hair-897817.jpg 5760w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-in-blue-and-brown-plaid-dress-shirt-touching-his-hair-897817-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-in-blue-and-brown-plaid-dress-shirt-touching-his-hair-897817-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-in-blue-and-brown-plaid-dress-shirt-touching-his-hair-897817-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5760px) 100vw, 5760px\" /></p><p>You have set out to do something and you ended up not reaching it is the simplest way to describe what a failure is. My first BIG failure was setting out a goal to earn my degree in 4 years but instead, it took me 5.5 years. It might not mean a lot at first glance but it meant losing my scholarship. I was a straight-A student and was part of my university&#8217;s honor roll and in just one semester, I just decided to drop my system administration class. I don&#8217;t even remember why but I do remember the feeling of regret that followed and living through the consequences after. I was 18 and already feeling like a total failure&#8211;that nothing could top that. How wrong I was.</p><p>We all have our idea of success. We have it ingrained in our brains since we were young. It starts when our parents would tell us what they would like us to be when we grow up. Then when we&#8217;re older, our idea of success is reaching our dreams. What we lacked is the idea of failure because it&#8217;s something that we don&#8217;t want to talk about.</p><p>&#8220;Failure is not an option.&#8221; We hear this quite a lot. It might not be an option for you and me, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s never going to happen. It has happened to very successful people like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, JK Rowling, Walt Disney, and so many more. When you think about those people I have just mentioned, you don&#8217;t think about their failures because their success is so much bigger than their failures. That there is your true option&#8211;to be bigger than your failure.</p><h2>Here are 3 simple strategies on how you can bounce back from failure</h2><h3>1. Do not let your failure define who you are</h3><p>Simply put, you are not your failure. Do not dwell or beat yourself up when you fail. It happens even to the best of us. Instead of telling yourself &#8220;If only I did this&#8221;, tell yourself &#8220;Next time, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do.&#8221; The difference between the two phrases is worlds apart. One focuses on the failure while the other focuses on opportunities for growth.</p><p>When you let your failure get the best of you, this is when you feel pathetic that you are not capable of succeeding. It paralyzes you into doing nothing. So you lost a promotion to someone else. Does that mean that you shouldn&#8217;t aim for that next promotion? Of course not. It should mean that there are some things that you still need to work on or areas for improvement. You weren&#8217;t able to sign on a client? Ok. Work on the next one and see what you can improve on.</p><p>Just because you failed once doesn&#8217;t mean that you will fail the next time. Failure teaches us that there is a way for us to improve.</p><h3>2. Make changes to your environment</h3><p>When you make changes to your environment, the people you hang out with, the places you go, the music you listen to, helps rewire your brain. It can help you see things in a different light.</p><p>Take time to work outside your usual working environment. Do your thinking time in a park or work from a coffee shop or public library. Make that change.</p><p>Talk to people who might have experienced the same failure as you. Ask them how they managed to turn things around and if they are not there yet, figure it out together.</p><p>Did you go through a bad break up (or even an okay one)? Go to a new place to eat. Don&#8217;t go back to the usual places or else you&#8217;re just going to mope.</p><h3>3. Strive to be happy</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16102 size-full\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/group-of-people-having-fun-together-under-the-sun-708392.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5090\" height=\"3393\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/group-of-people-having-fun-together-under-the-sun-708392.jpg 5090w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/group-of-people-having-fun-together-under-the-sun-708392-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/group-of-people-having-fun-together-under-the-sun-708392-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/group-of-people-having-fun-together-under-the-sun-708392-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5090px) 100vw, 5090px\" /></p><p>Happy people are productive people. This is arguably one of Thanh&#8217;s favorite phrases because it&#8217;s true. The happier you are the more productive you&#8217;ll be.</p><p>You might think that it&#8217;s impossible to be happy after failing at something. It is impossible if you manage to forget the things that make you happy.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with this question: what makes you happy?</p><p>Whatever those are will be one of the reasons why you will bounce back from failure. More than a decade ago, my friends and I decided to build our own BPO. Unfortunately, our investors backed out during our 2nd year and we had to close it down. I was in a rut for two months. I would have to admit that I didn&#8217;t handle it well. I isolated myself from the people who mattered most. When I finally got tired feeling pathetic, I reached out to my friends. They were my happiness (still are). Finding my happiness brought me to where I am right now.</p><p>Things happen for a reason. That reason is growth. Each failure is a chance for growth. Embrace it and bounce back.</p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>Write down what makes you happy and put it somewhere that you can see every single day. Remember, when you&#8217;re happy you are productive.</p> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 02 Jun 2020 11:00:48 +0000","feedId":10782,"bgimg":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/success-1123017_1920.jpg","linkMd5":"24c6156d9ebee3bf6b32c415cb606670","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn38@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-12-112_65501fef9b66279e.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":323932,"destBytes":50636,"author":"Marmel Becerial","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/success-1123017_1920.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn38@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-12-112_65501fef9b66279e.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-in-blue-and-brown-plaid-dress-shirt-touching-his-hair-897817.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn92@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-51-227_c160e04b9d84e53f.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/group-of-people-having-fun-together-under-the-sun-708392.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-53-447_ade3e1a397419c86.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317508239},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","title":"Are You Making This GTD Mistake?","link":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/?p=16261","description":"<p><img src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thanh-gtd.jpg\" /></p><p>I first learned about GTD back in 2008 when I picked up a paperback at the local bookstore. A few weeks earlier I got promoted at work and I was overwhelmed. Deadlines were getting missed, my workload went up and I had no way of handling this.</p><p>Then I remembered my uncle, a successful entrepreneur, telling me about GTD and how it helped him. He was someone I looked up to so I decided to get my own copy of <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/gtd-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getting Things Done</a> by David Allen.</p><p>It helped me get a system place for handling my day-to-day. For the first time since my promotion, I was on top of everything and I felt like I had a new superpower.</p><p>Fast forward to today, after starting Asian Efficiency, <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/gtd-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I&#8217;ve learned a lot about the GTD methodology</a>. I was a purist for a few years until I developed my own productivity system that we now teach to our clients. Through Asian Efficiency, we&#8217;ve helped thousands of people be more successful with the Getting Things Done methodology.</p><p>After helping so many clients we&#8217;ve noticed that there&#8217;s one common mistake that we see most new GTD users make. Are you making this mistake?</p><h3>#1 Mistake New GTD Users Make</h3><p>Many years ago, I met this smart and beautiful woman in Las Vegas. We were both single and flirting with each other. She asked me what I did for a living and I said that I was blogging about productivity.</p><p>&#8220;You must be a GTD user too,&#8221; she said.</p><p>&#8220;Yes, I am. I doubt you are.&#8221;</p><p>Playfully she replied, &#8220;Excuse me? Are you doubting me that I don&#8217;t know what GTD is?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yes I do. What&#8217;s the most important step in Getting Things Done?&#8221;</p><p>Only someone who is a GTD practitioner and follows the methodology on a regular basis would be able to answer this question. A few seconds later, she said:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the review step. Without it, the whole system falls apart.&#8221;</p><p>(That&#8217;s when I fell in love with this woman. We ended up dating for a few years.)</p><p>She&#8217;s right. The review step, which sometimes is referred to as the Reflect step, is the most important step of the whole GTD framework. Without it, you cannot be on top of everything that&#8217;s going on. Especially if you&#8217;re in a situation where you have many things going on at work, hundreds of emails to deal with, and many meetings to attend.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/quick-capture-primer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It&#8217;s easy for pieces of information, tasks, and reminders to get scattered all over the place</a>. Organizing that is important (which is why it&#8217;s one of the steps in GTD) but reviewing everything is crucial to get yourself focused on the right things coming ahead of you.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/David-Allen-and-Thanh-Pham-480x640.jpg\" /></p><p>The biggest mistake I see that new Getting Things Done users make is that they are not consistently doing their reviews. Out of the five steps in the GTD methodology, this is the most neglected step. Without the review step, you might end up focusing your time and energy on the wrong thing. That&#8217;s not productive, is it?</p><p>So why do people struggle with this step so much? Based on my experience, there are a couple of reasons why:</p><ul><li>It can be very tedious the first few times you do it</li><li>It can take a long time to do (an hour or two)</li><li>You have to make it a habit <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/149-gtd-setup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which is already hard to do on top of everything else you have to learn</a></li></ul><p>The tricky thing with the review step, which the book recommends you do weekly, is that when you skip it you don&#8217;t immediately see the negative effects of it. The flip side is also true when you do review your projects and lists you feel temporarily that you have a grasp of what&#8217;s coming up. However, that feeling might only last a few minutes and then it&#8217;s gone. So you might not make it habitual because you don&#8217;t see the big benefit of it.</p><p>When you skip it a few times and don&#8217;t experience any repercussions, it&#8217;s easy to keep on skipping it and not realize you&#8217;re slowly getting to a place of overwhelm. It&#8217;s a slow process that will creep up on you.</p><p>Once you hit the tipping point that&#8217;s when you feel overwhelmed, deadlines are getting missed, and you start to procrastinate more often. You hit the point of wanting to do &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/116-getting-things-done-mistakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GTD all over again</a>&#8221; because your projects, lists, and inbox are cluttered and all over the place.</p><p>That could have all been prevented when you did your review regularly. You have to think of it as cleaning your home on a regular basis. If you don&#8217;t do it you can still be a clean freak but eventually, it&#8217;ll get messy.</p><p>Imagine that you want to have people come over for dinner. What do you do? You probably start cleaning first, putting stuff away, organizing your home, and making sure everything is in the right place before you start cooking and setting the dinner table.</p><p>Imagine for a moment that you already had a clean house. Everything was dusted, there are no clothes on the floor and the dishes were clean. Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier, stress-free, and more fun to start preparing for dinner and having friends come over?</p><p>That&#8217;s possible for your life too when you regularly review everything. You don&#8217;t have to do all the cleaning, moving, and organizing before you do think about how to have a fun dinner party. It&#8217;s already nice and tidy! All you have to focus on is to &#8220;do the work&#8221; and you make it easy for your future-self to get started. No more procrastination, feeling overwhelmed or feeling behind.</p><p>Now you&#8217;re on top of everything and you can focus on what matters in front of you.</p><h3>How Often Should You Review?</h3><p><img src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gtd-640x511.png\" /></p><p>To continue the house cleaning analogy, some people are messier than others. Personally, I&#8217;m a very messy person which is why I have a housekeeper coming by every week. Without her help, my place would look like a refugee camp where my parents were in the 80s.</p><p>(Fun fact: I was born in a refugee camp in the Philippines after my parents escaped the communist regime in Vietnam.)</p><p>Others aren&#8217;t that messy and keep their homes clean every day and it might take them a few weeks before it gets messy. They might need a housekeeper to come by once a month.</p><p>Everyone&#8217;s situation is different and the same is true for you with how often you need to keep your projects and lists in check. The GTD book recommends starting with once a week which is a great idea for most of us. After working with some clients, I&#8217;ve also discovered that a weekly review too long of the time period because they&#8217;re so busy and have many daily things to deal with that they needed a daily review. Some even do it twice a day because their lives are that hectic.</p><p>My recommendation is to start with once a week. If your life is so busy filled with lots of emails, meetings, requests, and daily new tasks you want to move to a daily review. Most of our clients find that doing it towards the end of the day helps them stay on top of everything.</p><p>If you&#8217;re like me and you only need a weekly review, here&#8217;s how to make it consistent: schedule it on your calendar and make it a ritual. For me, this is every Sunday at 6 pm. For newbies, it might take 30-60 minutes to do a review but you&#8217;ll get faster at it the more you do it.</p><p>Nowadays I can do mine in about 15-20 minutes. In fact, I have a very simple checklist that I follow in Evernote <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/technology/best-gtd-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of our recommended GTD apps </a>so I know exactly what I need to do each time (and not rely on my memory and start wandering off doing other things).</p><h3>Next Actions</h3><p>We have a podcast called The Productivity Show and we just released an episode on the <a href=\"http://theproductivityshow.com/309\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top 5 Mistakes Most GTD Users Make</a>. We go into more detail there too of other things you might be doing wrong and how to fix it.</p><p>If you want to get more productivity training and my checklist for a weekly review, you have to become a Dojo member.

Perhaps you’ve been working from home for years and love it, or maybe you are like the millions of knowledge workers who suddenly found themselves working from home thanks to the 2020 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Most of us who start working from home start with a less-than-ideal setup. Maybe you’re trying to do Zoom calls from a table in your bedroom. Maybe you’ve commandeered half the dining table as your “office,” or perhaps you’re like my wife’s colleague who does his Microsoft Teams calls from the garage because it is the only place he can get peace and quiet from the kids.</p>\n<p>If you’re lucky, you even have a room in your home with a door you can close to your home office (now that’s a modern luxury!)</p>\n<p>Either way, being productive while working from home can be a challenge if you don’t have the right tools. Over the years, we’ve helped tens of thousands of people with their productivity, and many of those people have been trying to work from home.</p>\n<p>We have found that those of you working from home have faced some common challenges: how do you get your work done in the time that you have, without it bleeding into “home life”? How do you separate the two? We’ve recorded several <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/297-work-from-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcasts about working from home</a> and have talked about <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/strategy-wfh-pandemic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the importance of self-care when working from home</a>, but this is a question that comes up over and over again:</p>\n<p>“What gear do you need to work from home productively?”</p>\n<p>By “gear,” we are talking about your physical tools — things like desks, chairs, technology, AND digital tools — things like desktop &amp; mobile apps.</p>\n<h2>Do you <em>need</em> special gear to work from home?</h2>\n<p>This might be a surprising answer, but no! You don’t <em>need</em> anything special to work from home. Many people work just fine with whatever table and chair they have around, and their laptop or tablet.</p>\n<p>So why bother upgrading?</p>\n<p>We have a lot of experience with this topic. Thanh, myself, and other members of the AE team have worked from home for more than a decade each. Combine that experience with the experience of AE customers, blog readers, and podcast listeners, and we’ve found that there’s a difference between <em>living with</em> a less-than-ideal setup and <em>thriving</em> by having a physical and digital work from home setup that helps you be more productive at home.</p>\n<p>It’s the difference between a setup that propels you forward instead of standing in your way.</p>\n<h2>Our Favorite Work From Home Gear</h2>\n<p>We’ve been asked so many times about the gear that we recommend for working from home that we put together this special resource for you.</p>\n<p>It is called <a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/home-office-hero-evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Office Hero</a>, and it is a super-quick, super-actionable resource that takes you through our top recommendations for working from home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/home-office-hero-evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to learn more about Home Office Hero</a>.</p>\n<p>I am currently car shopping, so I know how frustrating it is to wade through reviews and recommendations, most of which conflict, trying to figure out what will help you and what is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>If you’re building your work from home setup, you probably want someone just to say, “Here is what you need, and why.” That’s <a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/home-office-hero-evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Office Hero</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s the challenge: there are so many things that help us work from home, we have more recommendations that we couldn’t fit into Home Office Hero. We decided to share them with you here, so think of this article as an appendix to Home Office Hero.</p>\n<p>We’re going to share four physical tools and four digital tools, in no particular order.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started.</p>\n<h3>Physical Gear</h3>\n<p><strong>1. External Webcam</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16293\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-brio-2.jpg\" alt=\"Logitech Brio\" width=\"250\" height=\"232\" /></p>\n<p>You might be thinking: “my laptop already has a built-in camera. Why would I need another one?”</p>\n<p>A built-in webcam will work fine, but we like using an external webcam because it gives you more flexibility. The quality is usually better, and you can position it how you want.</p>\n<p>For example, having a webcam lets you use a large monitor and have it positioned in front of you. If you use your laptop’s camera, you need to have your computer in front of you, or you need to look off to the side when you want to look at the camera.</p>\n<p>Here are two options:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fZ5yXz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Logitech C920</a> — This is the camera that I have used for years and years. It is good quality, works with both Mac and Windows, and is affordable.</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jppogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Logitech Brio</a> — This is the webcam that both Thanh and I currently use. It shoots 4K video and is an upgrade over the C920.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. External Keyboard &amp; Mouse</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16294\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-k570-2.jpg\" alt=\"Logitech K750\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" />&nbsp;<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16295\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-mx-master-2.jpg\" alt=\"Logitech MX Master\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-mx-master-2.jpg 250w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-mx-master-2-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-mx-master-2-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></p>\n<p>Continuing the “flexibility is key” theme, having an external keyboard and mouse/trackpad lets you give you much more flexibility with your home office setup.</p>\n<p>Since you don’t need to type on your laptop’s keyboard, you can have your computer raised and/or off to the side, and set things up more ergonomically.</p>\n<p>Here are some options:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Logitech K750 (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WVWCur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows</a>) (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/30Ubt9M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mac</a>) Solar Powered Keyboard — this is the keyboard that Thanh uses</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hH87Om\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Logitech MX Master Mouse </a>— this is the mouse that Thanh uses</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://iqunix.store/products/f96-coral-sea-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=30308776837180\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IQUNIX F96 Coral Sea Wireless Mechanical Keyboard</a> — Mechanical keyboards are all the rage right now. <a href=\"https://shop.asianefficiency.com/dojo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dojo</a> member Luc recommends this one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Anti-Fatigue Floor Mat</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16299\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fully-stand-mat.jpg\" alt=\"Fully Mat\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fully-stand-mat.jpg 400w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fully-stand-mat-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fully-stand-mat-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p>\n<p>We recommend <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/202-home-office/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">using a standing desk</a> for your home office, at least part of the time. The problem with a standing desk is that your feet, knees, and back can become sore — especially when you are still getting used to it.</p>\n<p>If you work while standing, an anti-fatigue floor mat can make things much more comfortable.</p>\n<p>Here are some options:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.fully.com/accessories/standing-desk-mats/stand-mat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fully Stand Mat</a> — this is the mat that I use, which I bought with my standing desk.</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eMKH8r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anti Fatigue Comfort Floor Mat By Sky Mats</a> — a top-rated and affordable mat</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CIVfbJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ergodriven Topo Mini Floor Mat</a> — a compact non-flat mat to encourage movement, stretching, and massage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Purse Hanger</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16296\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tapp-purse-hanger-2.jpg\" alt=\"Purse Hanger\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tapp-purse-hanger-2.jpg 250w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tapp-purse-hanger-2-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tapp-purse-hanger-2-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></p>\n<p>An organized desk <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/how-to-design-your-environment-to-make-it-work-for-you-not-against-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contributes to focus</a>, but it is hard to have an organized office when you have headphones and cables all over the place.</p>\n<p>There are fancy and specialized tools for hanging headphones and organizing cables, but Thanh swears by this surprising solution: purse hangers.</p>\n<p>Traditionally they are used to hang expensive handbags on the side of tables and bars so that one doesn’t have to place them on the floor. They work just as well for hanging headphones and wrangling cables, and best of all, they are inexpensive so you can buy a few to use around your workspace.</p>\n<p>Here are some options:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/39z1hrg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swivel Top Purse Hanger</a> — The hook Thanh uses</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/?p=16290/%20https://amzn.to/2PdpgDb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hero Clip</a> — Dojo members Janeira and Phil recommends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Digital Tools</h3>\n<p>Your work from home setup doesn’t end with your physical gear. You can be more productive using your devices as well, and here are some tools that will help you do that.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Webcam Settings App</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16302\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/webcam-settings.jpg\" alt=\"Webcam Settings\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/webcam-settings.jpg 250w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/webcam-settings-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/webcam-settings-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></p>\n<p>If you are on camera a lot, your webcam settings might not be ideal. Maybe it is showing more than you want behind you, and you’d like to zoom in. Perhaps the color and light aren’t quite right, and you don’t look your best.</p>\n<p>Your Webcam may come with software to help, but if not, you may have some options:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Windows: Change the <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/17444/windows-camera-app-webcams-help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">settings in the Camera app</a></li>\n <li>Windows: If you are techy, there is <a href=\"https://github.com/jpalbert/webcam-settings-dialog-windows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a hack to access a Camera settings dialog from a shortcut</a>.</li>\n <li>Mac: I have used an app called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webcam-settings/id533696630?mt=12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webcam Settings</a> for years and years. It lets you have fine control over your webcam’s settings from any app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. File Sharing App</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16291\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dropshare.jpg\" alt=\"Dropshare\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dropshare.jpg 250w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dropshare-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dropshare-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></p>\n<p>If you are working from home, you will likely be sharing files, images, and other materials with colleagues. In some cases, you might do that with the built-in tools in Slack or Microsoft Teams, but there is a class of app that lets you quickly upload and share a file, and then automatically copy the link to your clipboard.</p>\n<p>This makes it fast and easy to collaborate and get feedback.</p>\n<p>Here are some options:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://droplr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Droplr</a>: This is a cross-platform Windows and Mac app.</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://dropshare.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dropshare</a>: This is the app that Thanh and I use. Best of all, it is part of SetApp, the “Netflix of Mac apps.” So if you are a subscriber, you don’t need to pay extra for it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Waterminder</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16297\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/waterminder.jpg\" alt=\"Waterminder\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/waterminder.jpg 250w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/waterminder-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/waterminder-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></p>\n<p>Between writing tool #2 and tool #3, I took a quick break to get up, stretch my legs, and refill my water. Why? Because the Waterminder app on my phone reminded me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waterminder.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Waterminder</a> is an iOS, Android, and Apple Watch app that tracks how much water you drink and reminds you when it is time to drink more.</p>\n<p>You can set a goal for how much water you want to drink per day (or it can suggest one), and then it helps you work towards it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16301\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/waterminder-screen.jpeg\" alt=\"Waterminder\" width=\"300\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/waterminder-screen.jpeg 300w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/waterminder-screen-293x500.jpeg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>This is a helpful tool when you work from home because it is so easy to just stay at your desk grinding away and to forget to take breaks and hydrate.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Screen Capture App</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16298\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zappy.jpg\" alt=\"Zappy\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zappy.jpg 250w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zappy-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zappy-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></p>\n<p>When you work with colleagues in an office, collaborating and getting feedback is easy. If you want to show someone something, you just grab them and ask them to come to your desk.</p>\n<p>If you want to help someone with something, you just walk over, sit beside them, and show them.</p>\n<p>When you work from home, collaborating and assisting becomes more complicated, but some tools can help.</p>\n<p>A screen capture app lets you record screenshots or quick videos and marks them up with arrows, text, etc.</p>\n<p>If a picture is 1,000 words, a helpful screengrab is 5,000.</p>\n<p>Here are some options:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://zapier.com/zappy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zappy</a> — Zappy is a free app from Zapier, but unfortunately, it is macOS only. Thanh uses it.</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snagit</a> — Snagit is available for Windows and Mac, and is what I use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Whether you only go through this list or pair it with <a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/home-office-hero-evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Office Hero</a>, our advice is the same:</p>\n<p>Don’t let analysis paralysis get you — just pick <strong>1</strong> piece of work from home gear to start.</p>\n<p>Even if none of these physical or digital tools grab your interest, look around: is there something about your setup that you’re “living with”? What can you improve that would make a difference? What is the next step to make that happen?</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 11:00:27 +0000","feedId":10782,"bgimg":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wfh-gear.jpg","linkMd5":"4185b6a12e8b6bb813d0a0534f432ad7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn69@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-11-145_bae9d5f5850f476c.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":174583,"destBytes":98184,"author":"Brooks Duncan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wfh-gear.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn69@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-11-145_bae9d5f5850f476c.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-brio-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-05-48-356_78226fa63678c466.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-k570-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-48-357_86c23254a5162ec0.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/logitech-mx-master-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-05-48-473_d021982db1839e1e.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fully-stand-mat.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-48-489_ae7441440fd92483.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tapp-purse-hanger-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn80@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-48-514_ca80923d06ad6f96.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/webcam-settings.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-49-033_e79d5a5997f28ae0.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dropshare.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn47@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-05-48-353_37437ab63bef2804.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/waterminder.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-05-49-263_caec3b793ebcefd2.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/waterminder-screen.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-05-49-701_76d1d2d7a3742c99.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zappy.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn15@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-05-48-335_163c1e11937acd1a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317508237},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","title":"Q1 Goal Check-In: How We’re Doing, And How You Can Stay On Track With Yours (TPS294)","link":"http://www.asianefficiency.com/?p=15974","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10360\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TheProductivityShow_FB-e1482589435887.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"363\" /></p><p>The first quarter of the year is done — how are you doing on your yearly goals?

Heck, our podcast The Productivity Show and the Asian Efficiency blog is all free and consumed by millions of people every year.</p><p>More information does not necessarily mean that you execute on it. Just because you read an article about the five steps to writing down an effective goal does not mean that you immediately implement it, right?</p><p>When we started Asian Efficiency, part of our brand promise was to make everything simple and actionable. Whether you listened to a podcast, read a blog post, or bought one of our courses &#8211; you could expect everything to be simple and actionable.</p><p>Over the years we have seen that more information is confusing people. There are a lot of conflicting ideas, thoughts, and pieces of advice out there. One person says you should do &#8220;x&#8221;, Asian Efficiency says do &#8220;y&#8221; and another podcaster says you need to do &#8220;z&#8221; if you want to be productive. When all these suggestions don&#8217;t overlap or conflict with each other, you get confused, paralyzed, and don&#8217;t take action.</p><p>Take for example the diet industry. If you&#8217;ve been trying to lose weight and thinking of switching to a different diet, you might have heard someone say to do keto, paleo or even the carnivore diet. They&#8217;re all popular but have conflicting ideas such as how many carbs you should eat. It&#8217;s so confusing and you end up doing nothing.</p><p>That&#8217;s a problem! Confusion leads to inaction. We&#8217;ve seen so many people struggle with implementing and executing in the last few years.</p><p>So when we thought about how we can best help people, we knew that putting more information out there is not the solution. We already do that with our podcast and blog. We&#8217;ve realized that there&#8217;s a lot of information in there and not enough value to help people EXECUTE and IMPLEMENT. To do the damn thing that people procrastinate on (which oftentimes are important tasks).</p><p>So we&#8217;re going to address that!</p><p>In 2015 we started the largest private productivity community and training library called the Dojo. This is where members can share ideas with each other and learn from other like-minded people. Every month you will also get a live coaching call with Asian Efficiency team members where you can ask questions and get answers. Members also received 6 new productivity courses a year that aren&#8217;t available anywhere else.</p><p>But we realized it was lacking something &#8211; there wasn&#8217;t enough focus on EXECUTION &#38; IMPLEMENTATION. It was the same model of &#8220;more information&#8221; but it wasn&#8217;t emphasizing enough implementation.</p><p>That had to change. Especially when we&#8217;ve seen so many people struggle with execution and implementation.</p><p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to announce the <strong>Dojo 2.0</strong> &#8211; the new and improved Dojo that is focused around EXECUTION and IMPLEMENTATION.</p><h2>Dojo 2.0</h2><p>What is <strong>Dojo 2.0</strong> and what does this mean to you?</p><p>Every month Dojo members will have a live implementation session called <strong>Do The Damn Thing</strong> (DTDT). Each month there&#8217;s a productivity topic and we will invite you to join us on the live implementation session. On the live session, we will teach for a little bit on the topic and then the rest of the time we will give you prompts and exercises to EXECUTE &#38; IMPLEMENT live on the call. By the time the hour is over, you will have implemented everything we&#8217;ve taught you on the live call.

What’s great about being part of the Dojo is that everyone has a similar goal. So you can bet someone in the community has already gone through what you are going through now and can provide guidance, advice and a few tricks.</p><p>As a freelancer, Jonathan quickly realized that time is gold. With no one telling him what to do he had to learn how to manage his own time with the work he was doing. That’s when a quick search on the internet led him to Asian Efficiency. He turned to the Dojo community and mini-courses to help him get organized. Now he has his systems in place and has more control over his life.</p><p>Read on and find out more about Jonathan’s productivity journey and why he is our productivity champ of the month.</p><h2>Introducing Jonathan Fisher</h2><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15855\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jonathan-Fisher.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"325\" height=\"331\" /></p><p><strong><em>Tell us a little bit about who you are and what you’re up to.</em></strong></p><p>I’m Jonathan Fisher. So I live in Cape Town, South Africa (the most beautiful city in the world!) where I work online as a freelance copywriter. I don&#8217;t have a website yet, but I am on <a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0124edb0371a507db1?viewMode=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Upwork</a>.</p><p><strong><em>What is the backstory that ignited you to get started on becoming more productive?</em></strong></p><p>When I got into copywriting and freelancing, I quickly realized that my time was my most valuable resource. And I needed to use my time efficiently and intelligently if I was going to consistently drive my results forward. That’s when Asian Efficiency first popped on my radar.</p><p><em><strong>What was the wall or problem that you ran into that stopped you from accomplishing what you wanted?</strong></em></p><p>Well, before joining Asian efficiency I had the horrible belief that I was just not an “organized type”. That meant for a while I didn’t have any systems to keep me on track and moving towards my goals. Even worse, I just felt anxious all the time and like I was “lost at sea”. As you can imagine that’s just a recipe for disaster! But luckily I wisened up and came across your website in my search for a solution.</p><p><em><strong>What was the epiphany you experienced and discovered?</strong></em></p><p>I realized that there’s no “productivity gene”. Productive people are not born, they’re made. Because it’s just a skill set&#8230; and like any skill set, it can be learned!</p><p><em><strong>What was the transformation that you experienced?</strong></em></p><p>After consuming and implementing tons of videos and articles in the Dojo &#8211; it’s an absolute GOLDMINE in there by the way &#8211; I suddenly felt like I had control over my life. My anxiety melted away, and I was left with the empowering feeling that I’m in the driver seat of my life. I now know what I need to do and how I’m going to do it. It’s a mental bliss!</p><p><em><strong>If you have one piece of productivity advice for someone who is struggling to make progress towards their goals, what would it be?</strong></em></p><p>My best advice is trial and error everything (Dojo provides plenty of incredible resources to experiment with), take massive action and record both feedback &#8211; journaling helps &#8211; and use that feedback to inform your next actions. Then it’s just a reiterative process towards optimization and enhanced productivity.</p><p>Thank you, Jonathan, for sharing!</p><p>Jonathan is a great example of what we refer to in our community as a “productivity champ” — someone who continuously looks for ways to become better or someone who has a <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/171-growth-mindset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growth mindset</a>.

I am now Swiss too. My background was in Electronics. I started my career as a field engineer in the life sciences equipment industry. I climbed the ladder to director/VP roles in the company that hired me. Eventually, we got bought by GE. I spent 7 years with GE and learned a ton. This is where I became a Lean Six Sigma blackbelt. Continuous improvement/Process improvement took me into personal productivity. That&#8217;s when I put my nose into GTD 10 years ago. Since then from after-sales, I transitioned into sales and have been running a sales force for one of the top 5 CRO which got bought.</p><p>I then moved into a consultancy role since 2018 where I am helping clients to transform their businesses, focusing on all commercial processes. In parallel, I became a GTD certified trainer. Right now I am leading the deployment of a new ERP (SAP Business One) for a UK company.</p><p>When I am not working, I am supporting our 2 kids. One who&#8217;s into the Swiss national U23 Triathlon team and the other one into acting/dancing/singing. My private life is fairly simple either in training, bike mechanics or taxying kids somewhere for a competition or a show.</p><p><strong><em>What is the backstory that ignited you to get started on becoming more productive?</em></strong></p><p>A little be more than 10 years ago, I was overwhelmed with emails. Leading a P&#38;L and managing teams in different countries, I asked myself, I can&#8217;t be alone with my email problems. I started to Google and discovered an add-in for Outlook called Netcentrics at that time (before it became GTDOA). As I was watching some tutorials for this add-on, I discovered that one of the co-developer had written a book called GTD and his name was David Allen. This was it, I was not alone any longer. Guess what, I started to buy every possible audiobook and read all David&#8217;s stuff more than once.</p><p><em><strong>What was the wall or problem that you ran into that stopped you from accomplishing what you wanted?</strong></em></p><p>I was consumed by my work and I was focusing too much on climbing the corporate ladder. I realized that all of this had terrible side effects. Lack of energy, lack of purpose and meaning, not being totally present with my loved ones when I was with them. I was traveling almost every week, spending my life on planes and airports. I needed to ground myself and rebalance my whole life.</p><p><em><strong>What was the epiphany you experienced and discovered?</strong></em></p><p>When I discovered that GTD was a cutting edge differentiator for me, I became more focused, more productive and it allowed me to release quality time so I could build an athlete mindset. My son was instrumental, as he asked me to join him during some of his bike training sessions. Of course, along the way, I discovered AE, its podcast and the Dojo. At the beginning of my personal productivity journey, I did all the mistakes rookies do &#8211; I was constantly testing new apps, wasting a ton of hours on my GTD ecosystem instead of executing on my agreed next actions.</p><p><em><strong>What was the transformation that you experienced?</strong></em></p><p>AE Dojo introduced me to the 12WY. This was the missing link for me. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/gtd-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GTD</a> is great but I was missing the feedback loop <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/revisiting-the-12-week-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12WY</a> provides with its leading and lagging indicators. I decided to write a tool from the book which I shared in the Dojo. I am still using it every week. Thanks to hundreds of hours listening to various podcasts, reading personal development books (I am a great fan of Tony Robbins by the way), all of this taught me to eradicate the word &#8220;excuses&#8221; from my vocabulary. As I tell you, this makes a huge difference. I like the Asian Efficiency&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/tea-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TEA framework</a>. It&#8217;s all up to me on how I want to consume my time, energy and attention, no-one else.</p><p><em><strong>If you have one piece of productivity advice for someone who is struggling to make progress towards their goals, what would it be?</strong></em></p><p>Life is too short, what exactly are we chasing? What is the thinking mechanism at play when deciding on what goals to target?

I was probably 10 years old and I was just using it for my friends’ birthdays. Then when I was 12-13 years old, I started using the calendar for school activities.</p><p>Fast forward to several years (I refuse to say how long) and my usage of the calendar evolved. I am sure that it&#8217;s the same for you as well. What used to be a birthday and holiday calendar, is now where you have your commitments, opportunities, and what&#8217;s going on in your life. Your calendar is a reflection of what is important for you since it shows where you spend your time on&#8211;it shows what activities you allocate time for.</p><h2>The importance of the calendar</h2><p>A lot of people that I know uses the calendar. This is also a tool that Asian Efficiency would always share with our more than 13,000 customers. Even my 74-year-old mother uses the calendar to keep track of when she needs to harvest her crops. I&#8217;m talking about the Facebook game FarmVille. She also uses the calendar to keep track of when she and her sisters are supposed to have a call via FB Messenger.</p><p>On the other hand, I use the calendar to keep track of appointments (personal and work-related), focus time, gym, etc. I do not use it to keep track of tasks&#8211;there&#8217;s the task manager for that. I don&#8217;t use it for bills as well. <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/schedule-management/how-to-use-a-calendar-and-task-manager-together/\">It’s important that you separate your tasks from your calendar events.</a></p><p>Of course, there are levels when it comes to calendar expertise. Are you a beginner? Intermediate user? Or are you an expert calendar user aka a calendar Jedi?</p><p>No matter what your calendar-expertise level is, here are 3 ways you can take things to the next level and master your calendar.</p><h2>4 tips to master your calendar</h2><h3>1. Pick the calendar type you want to use</h3><p>Analog? Digital? Both?</p><p><strong>Analog Users</strong></p><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16215 size-medium_large\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Paper-Calendar-768x576.jpg\" alt=\"Paper Calendar\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Paper-Calendar-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Paper-Calendar-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Paper-Calendar-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br /> Despite the numerous apps and software available, the analog calendar or physical planners will not go obsolete. According to <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/writing-and-remembering-why-we-remember-what-we-write.html\">studies</a>, you remember things better when you write it down. Also, when you use an analog calendar or a planner, you can see everything at a glance and at the same time, prioritize and organize better.</p><p>Try this:</p><ul><li>for next week, on a piece of paper, write down everything that you need to put in your calendar</li><li>go over what you have written and decide the order it should go in your calendar</li><li>now that you have a better understanding of what needs to happen next week, add them all to your analog calendar</li></ul><p><strong>Our recommendations for analog calendars:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.neuyear.net/collections/wall-calendars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NeuYear Calendar</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.plannerpads.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PlannerPad</a></li><li>Whiteboard (believe it or not, everyone on the AE team has this)</li><li>Bullet Journal (we have a <a href=\"https://customer.asianefficiency.com/lessons/bullet-journal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dojo course</a> just for this)</li></ul><p><strong>Digital Users</strong></p><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16216 size-medium_large\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Calendar-768x510.jpg\" alt=\"App Calendar\" width=\"768\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Calendar-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Calendar-500x332.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Calendar-640x425.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br /> The three main reasons why users would go for digital calendars are: portability, convenience, and recurring events.</p><p>Using a digital calendar means that as long as you have your device with you, you have access to your calendar. At the same time, you can easily move events by just dragging it to a different date. It&#8217;s also portable in the sense that you can sync your calendar across devices. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re using a computer or your phone, you&#8217;re assured that whatever change you make on one device is carried over to other devices as well.</p><p>It&#8217;s also super easy to share events with other people. Then there&#8217;s the recurring events and reminders&#8211;which can be very tedious when you do it manually. Remember when I shared about my mom having a calendar event to speak with her sisters? I created a recurring event on her phone and shared it with her sisters. I also shared it with myself so that I can gently remind my mom about it a few hours before.</p><p><strong>Our digital recommendations are:</strong></p><ul><li>Google Calendar (iOS/Android)</li><li>BusyCal</li><li>Fantastical (iOS/Mac)</li><li>Outlook</li></ul><p><strong>Hybrid Users</strong><br /> You&#8217;d think that the Asian Efficiency team are all digital users. You&#8217;d be surprised to know that we are hybrid users. Our main calendar system is digital and we use the analog system as our secondary calendar.</p><p>I have a 12-year old and we have a shared family calendar. However, we still list down her weekly appointments on our fridge&#8217;s magnetic calendar. On it are birthdays that we need to attend as a family, school activities, doctor&#8217;s appointments.</p><p>You can use the <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/233-hybrid-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hybrid Calendar system</a> to stay on top of projects and tasks.</p><p>It doesn&#8217;t matter which one as long as you <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/digital-analog-calendar-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pick the right one</a> suitable for your usage.</p><h3>2. What do you need to put on your calendar</h3><p>This might sound controversial, but we don’t recommend using your calendar as your task list. There are task managers or to-do apps for that. If it&#8217;s the actual task or project that you need to work on, put it on your task manager. If you need to set some time aside specifically for that task or project, put it on your calendar.</p><p>Your calendar may include the following:</p><ul><li>Appointments &#38; Meetings</li><li>Time-specific tasks</li><li>Time blocks</li><li>Breaks</li></ul><p>Why breaks? Breaks are important for you to continue being productive. A tired person is an unproductive person because a tired brain can mean mediocre work.</p><p>Anything that is date and time-sensitive should go in our calendar. Do not stress your brain out trying to remember when your due for your next dental appointment or when you said you&#8217;d have lunch with your friends.</p><p>Aside from that, when you block out these events in your calendar, it means that no one can surprise you with an unplanned event (meetings and such) since it will be marked busy on your calendar.</p><p>We have courses in the Dojo about how to <a href=\"https://customer.asianefficiency.com/lessons/making-the-most-of-limited-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">correctly set up your calendar</a> and how to <a href=\"https://customer.asianefficiency.com/lessons/dojo-live-feb-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rock it</a>.</p><h3>3. Color-code your calendar events</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16217 size-medium_large\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colorful-Calendar-768x511.jpg\" alt=\"Colorful Calendar\" width=\"768\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colorful-Calendar-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colorful-Calendar-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colorful-Calendar-640x426.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p><p>When you are using a digital calendar, you can <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/schedule-management/color-code-your-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">color-code different events</a>. For example, you can have different colors for the following events:</p><ul><li>Workout</li><li>Breaks</li><li>Eating</li><li>Focus time</li><li>Rituals</li><li>Calls / Meetings</li></ul><p>This way, with just a glance at your calendar, you know which event is happening next and adjust your state of mind when needed. Do you need to mentally prepare yourself for your focus block? Or since gym time is next, it doesn&#8217;t matter which state you&#8217;re in as long as you go to the gym and sweat it out&#8230;?</p><p>Most of the calendar apps out there have the turn on/off feature so that you can focus on one area of your life at a time.</p><p>You can also use this technique even if you have an analog calendar. You can use colors OR emojis/icons.</p><p>Thanh uses emojis on his calendar (digital). He uses the camera emoji if it&#8217;s a video interview, microphone for podcast recordings, and then a star for an in-person meeting.</p><h3>4. Add buffer blocks to your calendar</h3><p>Do not fill your calendar to the brink of not being able to breathe or giving yourself time for changes. Use these buffer blocks to transition and use this time for a quick break.</p><p>You can use a buffer before a meeting to fill your water bottle and prepare for your meeting. If I have a meeting that I know will last for more than 15 minutes, I always use the restroom during the buffer block before the meeting. I also inform my family that I am about to go to a meeting.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/case-studies/nate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buffer block</a> doesn&#8217;t have to be a huge chunk of your time. It depends on what you have on your calendar.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Decide what type of calendar you are going to use. Then add your time-specific tasks, time blocks, appointments for the rest of the week.</p> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 11:00:53 +0000","feedId":10782,"bgimg":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/personal-organizer-768x512.jpg","linkMd5":"25df0beaf01dd618cfe9c91b72368881","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn66@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-05-10-949_2f560fa62ba1e4cc.webp","destWidth":768,"destHeight":512,"sourceBytes":53297,"destBytes":34762,"author":"Marmel Becerial","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/personal-organizer-768x512.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn66@2020_4/2020/08/25/01-05-10-949_2f560fa62ba1e4cc.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Paper-Calendar-768x576.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-05-48-361_646795a15583f7f3.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/App-Calendar-768x510.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-50-458_89b6a50fc57b9ef1.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colorful-Calendar-768x511.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-50-366_398360153ecddcb8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317508238},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","title":"Work From Home Challenge Day 2: Your Daily Reset","link":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/?p=16016","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16020\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cleared-room-desk.jpg\" alt=\"Cleared home office\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cleared-room-desk.jpg 1200w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cleared-room-desk-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cleared-room-desk-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cleared-room-desk-640x360.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></p><p>Welcome to Day 2 of the 5-day Work From Home Challenge. If you haven’t yet, make sure you check out and complete <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-1-dress-for-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Day 1</a> before continuing with today’s challenge.</p><p>You want to start with the right mindset, and once you have it, today’s challenge is all about beating procrastination and setting yourself up for success.</p><p>Yesterday you took the first step towards the work from home mindset by completing <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-1-dress-for-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Day 1</a>, so now it is time to make it easy for you to work each day.</p><h2>Help Your “Future You”</h2><p>So it is getting to the end of the workday. You’ve spent the day fighting distractions and making the best of your work from home situation, and now it is time to start wrapping up.</p><p>What do you do?</p><p>You have two options:</p><ol><li>Leave things exactly as they are. Your desk, the applications and windows you have open on your computer, everything.</li><li>Shut everything down, clean everything up, and do a “reset” so that everything is clean and clear for tomorrow.</li></ol><p>By the title of this article, you have probably guessed that we are going to recommend option number 2, but I didn’t always think that way.</p><p>My thinking was: if I am in the middle of something, I should leave things <em>exactly</em> where they are. Leave my applications open. Leave my 15 browser tabs up. Have the 8 Finder or Windows File Explorer windows all over the screen. Then when I come in the next day, everything will be there for me ready to go.</p><p>Here’s the problem — leaving your desk and device cluttered is an invitation for procrastination. <em>Theoretically</em> leaving everything open should make it easier to get started, but here is what happens. When you roll up to your desk in the morning, you are blasted with a bunch of information that makes you triggered and distracted.</p><p>Plus, the activity you were working on at the end of the day may not be what you should be focusing on first thing in the morning. It may not be <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/eat-that-frog-most-important-tasks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your most important task for the day</a>, or it may conflict with your morning ritual.</p><p>For example, the first thing I do when I go to my computer in the morning is <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/reasons-start-journaling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">journal</a>. Having a bunch of technical tools, browser tabs, and file windows open does not help me with that — starting with peace and clarity does.</p><p>We call this preparing-for-your-future-you concept <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/stop-procrastination-by-clearing-to-neutral/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clearing To Neutral</a>, and it is a powerful strategy to beat procrastination in the morning by eliminating friction.</p><h2>Enter Your Daily Reset</h2><p>The idea is to help your future you (aka, “tomorrow you”) and make it easy to hit the ground running with peace and clarity.</p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><ol><li>At the end of each day, close down your apps and browser tabs. If you <em>need</em> those tabs (for example, you’re in the middle of a research project), no problem. Your browser will have a function to bookmark the open tabs, or there are browser plugins that will let you save a group of tabs.</li><li>Clear your desk. Put things away. Re-shelf books, recycle/shred random paper, put away dishes and soda cans.</li><li>Look at your calendar and task manager for tomorrow. Is there anything you are going to need? Is there anything you can do now to make it easier for you to succeed tomorrow?</li></ol><h2>Working from home makes clearing to neutral even more important</h2><p>Having a daily reset and clearing to neutral is a powerful strategy at any time, but it becomes even more helpful when you work from home. You may be working in a less-than-ideal situation, and depending on your location, you can only <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/how-to-design-your-environment-to-make-it-work-for-you-not-against-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">design your environment</a> so much.</p><p>If due to space limitations, you’re forced to work in a shared family area, it becomes even more critical. If your “office” is the corner of the kitchen table or bedroom vanity, cleaning and clearing everything at the end of the day will make it more tolerable to live for you and your family members when you are <em>not</em> working.</p><h2>The daily reset in action</h2><p>As an example, here is my daily reset in action.</p><h3>The morning</h3><p>Here is my desk when I came down to my office in the morning. I understand that you may not be in a situation where you can have a room of your own to work in, but the concept is the same: desk is clean and clear, and my desktops are clear. I’m ready to get started with my day.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16017\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-morning.jpg\" alt=\"BD Desk in the morning\" width=\"900\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-morning.jpg 900w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-morning-500x313.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-morning-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-morning-640x400.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p><h3>Mid-day</h3><p>Just so I don’t give the impression of being some minimalist monk, here is my workspace right before typing these words.</p><p>You’ll see there are papers, books, devices, and even dirty dishes all over the place <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f648.png\" alt=\"🙈\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />. You don’t see another browser window with about 20 tabs open (don’t get Thanh started about my tabs.)</p><p>That’s ok! We all need to do what we need to do to get things done.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16019\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-midday.jpg\" alt=\"BD Desk mid-day\" width=\"900\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-midday.jpg 900w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-midday-500x324.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-midday-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-midday-640x415.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p><h3>End of Day</h3><p>Now the magic. Here’s a picture I took as I was closing down for the night.

When I sit down tomorrow morning, I’ll be ready to journal, have a quick meeting, and then tackle my “frog.”</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16022\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-signoff.jpg\" alt=\"BD End of Day\" width=\"900\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-signoff.jpg 900w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-signoff-500x299.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-signoff-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-signoff-640x383.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p><h2>What to do if things are a gong show now</h2><p>You’ll notice that my desk is clear and organized, much to my wife’s shock. Let’s just say she did not think I would be able to keep this up.</p><p>If your workspace is <em>not</em> clean and clear, what do you do?</p><p>There are two strategies you can take</p><ol><li>Take a <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/day-pain-suffering-1-trick-handling-backlog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Day of Pain &#38; Suffering</a>. Set aside a day (or more) to tackle it all, clear it up, and then maintain it using your daily reset going forward.</li><li>Schedule a daily or weekly “clutter clearing” session to chip away at it until it is clear. Then maintain using your daily reset.</li></ol><p>Both can work, but I found myself procrastinating on #1, so I went with strategy #2. I had a daily time on my calendar for 15 minutes a day to clean up, and even though it took a few weeks, eventually I got there. I found it easier to carve out 15 minutes than a whole day. I certainly would have got there faster with #1, though.</p><h2>Exercise</h2><p>Here we go, it’s time to put today’s lesson into action.</p><ul><li>Add time on your calendar and <strong>set a reminder</strong> to do your daily reset at the end of today, and every day. By the end of the day, you&#8217;ll be tired and won&#8217;t remember, so you need that reminder. You won’t feel like doing it, but once you establish the habit, it only takes a few minutes.</li><li>If needed, schedule your “day of pain and suffering” or “clutter cleanup session.”</li><li>Let us know in the comments when you’re done, and share when your daily reset time will be.</li></ul><div class=\"post-optin-wrapper\"><div class=\"inline-fields short-fields feature optin-form text-center post-optin\"><h2>Enter the Work From Home Challenge Giveaway</h2><p>Get 5 daily emails about the Work From Home challenge and get a chance to win great prizes:</p><form class=\"km-optin\" data-location=\"post\" data-offer=\"\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"https://forms.ontraport.com/v2.4/form_processor.php\" method=\"post\"><fieldset> <input class=\"text-input\" type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Your First Name\" /> <input class=\"text-input\" type=\"email\" name=\"email\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Your Email Address\" /> <input class=\"text-input\" type=\"tel\" name=\"sms_number\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Phone (optional)\" /> <input class=\"submit-button optin-submit\" type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" value=\"Enter Now\" /></fieldset> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"uid\" value=\"p2c7816f158\" /></form></div></div><p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-3-create-time-and-space-to-focus/\">Day 3 is now live</a>.</p> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 11:00:55 +0000","feedId":10782,"bgimg":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cleared-room-desk.jpg","linkMd5":"270e6ac60c24777b62100f2f40a59a41","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-11-429_7ffa12602ac5a503.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":675,"sourceBytes":90089,"destBytes":38434,"author":"Brooks Duncan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cleared-room-desk.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-11-429_7ffa12602ac5a503.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-morning.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-05-50-392_d44ffb7f86451611.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f648.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-49-227_65e30a70f41b57df.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-desk-midday.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn75@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-48-582_1eb2a95a9b83eb82.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-signoff.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-49-837_0be1c583fb9c188d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317508241},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","title":"The Winners For The 2020 Work From Home Challenge","link":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/?p=16134","description":"<p>We received over 300 entries for the <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Work From Home challenge</a> and we are still receiving feedback about it even though the deadline for the submission has passed.

However, with the situation we are currently in, things have changed drastically as everyone is home doing their own thing. We all just flew by the seat of our pants and let things evolve for the first couple of weeks of the stay at home order, and we were all struggling. My wife and I set up at the dining room table and attempted to put the kids at a table I rigged up from some wood I had laying around. We quickly realized this wasn&#8217;t working and knew we had to make a change. The timing of this happened to coincide with the Work From Home Challenge getting started, so it was a great excuse to move the kids and set my wife and me up at the table I built since we needed a more permanent place to work from. When doing this I had mentioned how I liked my space clean and that I used the CTN (clearing to neutral) method to do that. My family was intrigued by what that entailed. We got into a quick conversation about CTN and everyone was on board to start using it not just for work, but around the house too. We started that weekend with a quick CTN as part of our bedtime routine. The family loved it and that&#8217;s when my wife and son decided to take part in the Work From Home Challenge as well.</p><p>I mentioned in my first post that the domino video Thanh shared years ago was a good reminder of taking care of the easy steps first and letting the bigger steps come later. The simple act of dressing the part for work was a great way for each of us to get in the mindset of getting work done. Each of the subsequent daily challenges required a bit more, but the reward was greater too. By the time the challenge was complete, we all had a solid plan of what we needed to do to be successful that day and how we could set ourselves up for future days. We were able to establish a good morning routine to start the day out strong, find specific times in our days to focus on our most important tasks as well as take breaks to avoid burning out. Also, we all know when it&#8217;s time to shut down and come together as a family at the end of the day, and that&#8217;s so important when we are all stuck working at home with one another. It&#8217;s the little things that we do that lead to the biggest rewards, as they help set us up for future successes.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h3>Troy Knight</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16138 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Troy-Knight-500x333.jpeg\" alt=\"Troy Knight\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Troy-Knight-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Troy-Knight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Troy-Knight-640x426.jpeg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Troy-Knight.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p><p>Second Prize: Apple AirPods Pro</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I would say that one of the biggest changes that I have made as a result of the challenge has been to conscientiously take more breaks throughout the day. This truly has allowed me to keep more fresh as I work through the day.</p><p>I would furthermore emphasize that I still feel that a great deal of the learnings from this challenge can be boiled down to setting boundaries. Some of the boundaries are physical, such a completing the daily reset of the workspace and setting a cut off time. Moreover, much is mental in nature such as dressing for work, creating time and space to focus, and the necessity of breaks.</p><p>These lessons can also be easily applied once restrictions are eased and there is a transition back to an office environment. As a manager of a team, I have been and will continue to share these ideas and foster a positive work environment for all. I suspect that as a result of the positive results of my team, once this season is over we will be extended the option to work remotely more than the two days we had been allotted prior to us all being sequestered in our homes.</p><p>Thank you, again, for the time and effort put into facilitating this challenge and sharing the material.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h3>Alice Ferris</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16136 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Alice-Ferris-500x483.jpeg\" alt=\"Alice Ferris\" width=\"500\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Alice-Ferris-500x483.jpeg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Alice-Ferris-768x742.jpeg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Alice-Ferris-640x618.jpeg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Alice-Ferris.jpeg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p><p>Third Prize: The 12 Week Year by Brian P.

My &#8220;aha&#8221; moment was to be more honest with myself and my calendar. While I had cut-off times and buffer blocks already scheduled, in reality, I wasn&#8217;t honoring them. Now, I use my buffer block to once again clear to neutral and transition to making dinner. Making dinner is my signal to myself that I&#8217;m done for the day!&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Thank you, everyone, who participated!

Have you ever noticed that when it comes to productivity, the most robust strategies are the ones that we all have the most trouble performing consistently?</p><p>It’s not that they are <em>hard</em>, they are just things that, over time, get cut for more critical and urgent matters.</p><p>You’ve probably found that it is difficult to get everything done in the time that you have. When you feel that way, it’s just human nature to cut out things that don’t have an immediate benefit (or don’t seem to, at least.)</p><p>We’ve helped thousands and thousands of people with their productivity systems, and we’ve found that while short term cuts may help you right now, they will cause issues later on. In this article, we’re going to take you through how to do an effective and efficient Weekly Review, and we are going to share how to be consistent with your review. It almost always comes down to one of two things, and we’re going to help you with both of them.</p><h2>What <em>Is</em> The GTD Weekly Review?</h2><p>“GTD” stands for <em><a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/gtd-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getting Things Done</a>,</em> which is a popular book by David Allen. As I shared in my <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/technology/best-gtd-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article about GTD apps</a>, <em>Getting Things Done</em> was my first productivity book purchase back in September 2005.</p><p>I don’t say this lightly, but that book purchase changed my life and led to a considerable amount of career and personal growth.</p><p>(By the way, we also have a popular <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/gtd-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GTD 101</a> guide on the blog, and additonal GTD resources in <a href=\"https://shop.asianefficiency.com/dojo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Dojo</a>, our premium productivity community focused on execution and accountability.)</p><p>An important part (some would say <em>most</em> important) of GTD is the Weekly Review. It’s so useful that even if you don’t practice Getting Things Done yourself, you can still benefit from the Review.</p><p>In short, the Weekly Review is a quick (or <em>can</em> be quick if you follow this article) review of your GTD system and work in general:</p><ul><li>Your projects</li><li>Your next actions</li><li>Things you’re waiting for</li><li>Things you should have captured to your system but didn’t</li><li>Things you haven’t had the time to think about</li></ul><p>A popular idea from the GTD book is getting to a state of “mind like water.” The Weekly Review will help you get there every single week.</p><p>When I implemented GTD back in 2005, I was in awe of my initial “mind like water” moment and the ability of the Weekly Review to get me back there. There was only one problem: over time, I stopped being consistent in doing my reviews.</p><h2>What Happens When You Aren’t Consistent With Your Weekly Review</h2><p>Recently, we recorded a podcast called <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/309-gtd-mistakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 5 GTD Mistakes Almost Everyone Makes</a>. One of those mistakes is — you guessed it — not being consistent with the Weekly Review. But why is that a problem?</p><p>Here’s what usually happens — you are tired or swamped, so you decide to “not do it right now.” You aren’t planning to skip it totally; you’re just pushing it off to do later.</p><p>That “later” doesn’t come. Then next week, you skip again. Then the habit is broken.</p><p>Usually, this isn’t a problem right away. You still have an idea of what is going on, and your <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/quick-capture-primer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trusted system</a> is still trustworthy.</p><p>Slowly, over time, you’ll start to miss little things, and life and work will begin to become just a little bit more stressful. Things will start to creep up on you more and more, and eventually, your system will just blow up. You can no longer trust your system, and to the extent that you still <em>have</em> a system, you are just firefighting — putting out the loudest and most urgent fires, but never making real progress.</p><p>The Weekly Review is the secret sauce of GTD — with any system, things will naturally start to get out of control over time. The Weekly Review is what puts it back on track. Without it, things will just spiral.</p><p>You’ll have tasks missed, projects stuck, and follow-ups not done. You’ll start to have “phantom” tasks in your task manager sitting around that you will never actually do.</p><h2>The GTD Weekly Review Process</h2><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16254\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-postit.jpg\" alt=\"GTD Book with Postit\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-postit.jpg 1024w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-postit-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-postit-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-postit-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p><p>I have only one sticky note in my yellowed and battered 2005 copy of <em>Getting Things Done</em> that I added back in 2005. It has “Review” written in pencil. Every week I would grab the book off my shelf, flip to the sticky note, and go through the process.</p><p>Now thankfully, I’m more efficient and <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/technology/best-gtd-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have some tools to help</a>.</p><p>The latest editions of GTD break the review process into three main buckets:</p><ul><li><strong>Get Clear</strong> (I think of it as “looking backwards”)</li><li><strong>Get Current</strong> (I think of it as “look at the current situation”)</li><li><strong>Get Creative</strong> (I think of it as “brainstorm for the future”)</li></ul><p>Here’s what I do for each section. It differs a bit from the GTD book, so if you are unsure, feel free to start with their process and apply it to your own.</p><h3>1. Get Clear: Tie up any loose ends from the week before</h3><p><strong>Gather all the materials you have</strong>. These include physical documents as well as messages and emails.</p><ul><li><strong>Grab the loose papers</strong> around your desk, in your inbox, the unopened mail, everything. Go through it — is there anything actionable or that you need in there?</li><li><strong>Look at your notes</strong> since last week (or since the previous review). I use a notepad on my desk to jot down random notes, and every time I do a review, I draw a line across. Then I know where to start next time. Is there anything in there I missed capturing to my task manager?</li></ul><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16255\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-review-border.jpg\" alt=\"GTD Notes with Divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"527\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-review-border.jpg 800w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-review-border-500x329.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-review-border-768x506.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-review-border-640x422.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p><ul><li><strong>Look at your calendar items from the last week </strong>(or since the last review). Is there anything in there that triggers an “oh yeah! I need to…” response? Capture it.</li><li><strong>Look at your email inbox</strong>. Do you see anything actionable there? This is one area where I differ from the GTD book. It recommends getting to inbox zero at this time. If you can do that, great! However, for many people, that is going to lead to stress and procrastination — something the Weekly Review is supposed to stop. For now, skim through your inbox and see if there is anything obvious that you need to capture in there. Then you can <a href=\"http://asianefficiencygo.com/inbox-detox-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get your email under control</a> when you can.</li><li><strong>Look at your task manager’s inbox</strong>, if it has one. Is there anything in there that you captured but haven’t taken action on yet? Schedule it.</li><li><strong>Are there any ideas</strong> floating around in your head? Is there anything that comes to mind that you keep thinking, “I should…”? Capture it to your trusted system now!</li></ul><h3>2. Get Current: Make sure you can trust your trusted system</h3><p>If you’ve implemented Getting Things Done, you’ll have (or at least you’ll have had at one point) a trusted system broken down to projects and next actions. You’ll also have a Waiting For list.</p><p>What do you do if you’re no longer sure that you can trust your once-trusted system?</p><p>The Weekly Review is what will help you get sorted and stay there. Here’s what to do:</p><ul><li><strong> Look at your projects</strong>. What is done that you can remove? What can you get rid of? Maybe some projects are no longer relevant. Be honest and ruthless — perhaps you want to do it, but will you <em>really</em> do it in the short-medium term? Does every project have a next action? What’s the next thing that you can do that will move this project further?</li><li><strong>Look at your next actions.</strong> What do you need to accomplish immediately that had been flying under the radar? What isn’t relevant anymore? What can you break down further to make it more actionable?</li><li><strong>Review your calendar</strong>. What short, medium and long term calendar entries are coming up? Do you have action items to prepare for them? Do you want to do some “thinking time” ahead of time? Do you have trips to prepare for? Do you need to get things done before an upcoming holiday? Remember, this isn&#8217;t the time to actually <em>do</em> these things. You&#8217;re just identifying and capturing to your trusted system.</li><li><strong>Review your Waiting For list</strong>. Are there any followups needed? Do you need to check in with/prod anyone to get things going?</li></ul><p>The secret sauce for the Get Current step is to be honest and ruthless with removing tasks and projects. Make your trusted system an accurate representation of what is going on. Not what you wish was going on if the world was perfect.</p><h3>3. Get Creative: What can you be doing to move things forward?</h3><ul><li><strong>Look at your Someday/Maybe list</strong> — is “someday” or “maybe” finally here? Is there anything on there you should ditch?</li><li><strong>What can you eliminate</strong> that will give you time and space to be creative? What is holding you back from really making progress?</li><li><strong>What are some “big ideas” you have</strong>? Now it’s time to really get creative in the Get Creative phase. What are some “crazy” ideas you could have to move the needle? Are they really so crazy after all?</li></ul><p>This all sounds like a lot, but the more you do it, the faster it will go.</p><h2>How To Be Consistent With A GTD Weekly Review</h2><p>If being inconsistent with the GTD Weekly Review is such a problem, how do we fix it?</p><p>First, the Weekly Review will never happen until we make the time and space for it. In <em>Getting Things Done</em>, David Allen recommends blocking out 2 hours the afternoon of the last workday of the week.</p><ul><li>On the plus side, for many people, Friday afternoon is usually more open than other times of the week.</li><li>On the downside, many people are feeling brain-dead and tired by then and may feel like skipping it.</li></ul><p>In our opinion, for most people, two hours is too much. If you can do it, great!</p><p>Most of us need to figure out how to have a useful Review in much less time than 2 hours.</p><p>There is no “right” time to do your review. Since David Allen recommends Friday afternoons, that’s a great place to start, but the important part is to be <strong>realistic</strong> and <strong>experiment</strong>. Try Friday afternoon. If it doesn’t work, try Friday morning before work. If it doesn’t work, try Thursday near the end of the day. If it doesn’t work, try Sunday before the family wakes up.</p><h3>The Two Consistency Killers</h3><p>If you struggle to be consistent with your Weekly Review, it probably comes down to one of two reasons:</p><ol><li>The time is wrong. Experiment and try another one. Eventually, you’ll find one that works.</li><li>The review is taking too long. GTD purists will be angry with me (if they aren’t already) but focus more on the “Get Clear” and “Get Current” parts. Break off idea generation for another time. No law says you need to review your entire week in one shot. Perhaps you want the “Get Creative” part not to be done weekly, but maybe less often. Work in the habit of <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/thinking-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thinking Time</a> once a month or even once a quarter.</li></ol><p>Also (and again, <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f649.png\" alt=\"🙉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> GTD purists), it may be that you don&#8217;t need to review every project every single week. Some projects just don’t change that often.</p><p>For example, the GTD app that I use, OmniFocus, has a built-in Review feature that I love. One thing I love about it is that you can set your review frequency. So if I have a static project, maybe I want to review it every three weeks. I can do that easily.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16256\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/omnifocus-review-frequency.png\" alt=\"GTD Review Frequency\" width=\"528\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/omnifocus-review-frequency.png 528w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/omnifocus-review-frequency-500x252.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" /></p><p>Once you’ve experimented with your schedule and your duration, make sure it is on your calendar with multiple reminders. When it’s time to Review, you want to know about it.</p><h2>Next Actions</h2><p>Here’s what to do next:</p><ol><li>Look at your schedule for the next week. When is a <strong>realistic</strong> time to do your next GTD review?</li><li>Get it on your calendar and set multiple reminders.</li><li>Monitor how long the next one takes. Look for opportunities to make the process faster and more efficient.</li></ol> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 11:00:03 +0000","feedId":10782,"bgimg":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/thinking-computer.jpg","linkMd5":"ab58b24e9dd3aa36e60926676b05f3c1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn26@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-10-569_94eb55ed2581c210.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":881,"sourceBytes":119342,"destBytes":64692,"author":"Brooks Duncan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/thinking-computer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn26@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-10-569_94eb55ed2581c210.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-postit.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-05-49-612_472ce248625ceaf7.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gtd-review-border.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-05-50-294_8edec5c3f0c2a4a0.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f649.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-05-49-379_45236e806a836737.webp","https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/omnifocus-review-frequency.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-05-49-469_77f189ba40ad1839.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317508238},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","title":"How We Improved Our Lives and Work With Journaling – And You Can Too (TPS301)","link":"https://www.asianefficiency.com/?p=16131","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10360\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TheProductivityShow_FB-e1482589435887.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"363\" /></p><p>Do you find yourself with scattered thoughts, not sure what to work on at the start of your day, or do you go to bed with thoughts, tasks, and ideas swirling around in your head?</p><p>One of the most underrated but powerful productivity techniques is to journal.

At Asian Efficiency we write a lot about time management and productivity, two concepts that are related to success. Look at the successful people around you and you will notice that most of them are organized people who value their time. You might wonder what makes them so successful. Oftentimes, it is something you cannot see on the outside. Do you know what it is? It’s the mindsets these people have. <span id=\"more-1121\"></span></p><p>We&#8217;ve analyzed what successful people have in common when it comes to time management and productivity. While people can manage their time in many different ways, the principles behind it are the same. Coming up with these principles wasn’t easy, but zooming out and with some high-level thinking, we came up with 10 mindsets behind time management and productivity. Apply these mindsets for yourself and become an Efficient Asian.</p><h2>1. Inside-out.</h2><p>Before you can apply time management techniques, it is important to understand the logic behind them. It is not efficient to apply techniques and things to your life if you don’t understand why you are doing them. To get the full effect you have to understand the <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/mindsets/inner-game-of-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">psychology of time management</a> and it starts with how you think about time management. T. Harv Eker gives a great analogy in his book <em><a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/millionaire-mind/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Secrets of the Millionaire Mind</a></em> why working on your beliefs and mindsets are important. This is a direct quote from the book (which we highly recommend):</p><blockquote><p>Imagine a tree. Lets suppose this tree represents the tree of life. On this tree there are fruits. In life, our fruits are called our results. So we look at the fruits (our results) and we don&#8217;t like them; there aren&#8217;t enough of them, they&#8217;re too small, or they don&#8217;t taste good. So what do we tend to do? Most of us put even more attention and focus on the fruits, our results. But what is it that actually creates those particular fruits? It’s the seeds and the roots that create those fruits. It’s what’s under the ground that creates what’s above the ground. It’s what’s invisible that creates what’s visible. So what does that mean? It means that if you want to change the fruits, you will first have to change the roots. If you want to change the visible, you must first change the invisible.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, work on the inside first and your outer results will be a reflection of that. Having the right thoughts and views on time management will automatically translate in the right behaviors that will make you more productive. In order to improve your time management skills, you must first understand it. Once you understand the principles, it doesn’t matter how you apply them.</p><h2>2. Control.</h2><p>When people think of the purpose of time management, they think it is about being more organized. On the surface level, this is true. On a more deeper level, what time management really gives you is a sense of control and control to decide what you want to do.</p><div id=\"attachment_1125\" style=\"width: 509px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1125\" title=\"Locus of Control\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/locus_of_control.jpg\" alt=\"Locus of Control\" width=\"499\" height=\"202\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Locus of Control</p></div><p>In psychology, you have the concept of <strong>Locus of Control</strong>. What that comes down to is, the more you feel like you are in control of your life, the happier you are. By being able to manage your time and life efficiently, your sense of control goes up. That in return makes you a happier person. Isn’t that what everyone wants?</p><h2>3. Responsibility.</h2><p>The first step to being in control of your time and life is by taking responsibility for all your actions. When you take full responsibility, you are in control. It is easy to blame the outside world, but what that really means is that you are not in control. Remember in the previous point, the more you are in control of your life, the happier you feel.</p><p>Be the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of your life. As the CEO, you control what is going on and take full responsibility for everything. When things go bad, guess who gets the blame first? That’s right, the CEO. <em>Whether it is the CEO’s fault or not, the CEO always takes full responsibility for what is happening.</em></p><p><strong>The same idea applies to your life. You are the primary creative for your own life. How you manage yourself and time is your responsibility. You choose to focus and concentrate on the important tasks, or you choose to spend your resources on time wasters.</strong></p><p>During times when you don’t feel like you aren’t organized or you don’t like how much work you got done, take full responsibility for this. These inconveniences are a direct result of your actions (which you have control over). When you don’t take responsibility for them, it gets easy to blame external forces. The sad truth is, we often cannot influence external forces. That is thinking with an external locus of control, where you believe that outside forces directly control your ability to succeed.</p><p>Before we can move forward, we have to be able to accept where we are at right now. If you aren’t as organized as you like to be, take responsibility for it, accept it, and move forward. You can’t change the past, but you can influence your present and future. The only place to go is forward.</p><h2>4. Leverage points.</h2><p>What motivates you, might not motivate me to take action. Everyone has different triggers that motivate them. Find what motivates you to take action. These could be:</p><ul><li>Hopes</li><li>Dreams</li><li>Goals</li><li>Passion</li></ul><p>Once you have identified what motivates you, setup up triggers that will motivate you into action.</p><p>Nowadays, we get overwhelmed with things to do and information, and we easily get sidetracked. By reminding yourself constantly of your leverage points you keep yourself in check so you can focus on what is important to you.</p><h2>5. Clarity.</h2><p>Clarity is the driving force behind goal setting and prioritizing. Know what you want and where you are heading to. Not knowing what you want leads to procrastination and to wasting time on unimportant things.</p><p>When you prioritize, you have to know what the desired results are. That’s why for the <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/mindsets/the-pareto-principle-or-8020-rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80/20 rule</a> to be effective, you have to know what your desired outcome is. Or else there is no way you can figure out what is important and what is not. The same goes for goal setting. The very first step in goal setting is knowing what you want and then figuring out how to get it.</p><p>Having no clarity with what you want to achieve is like driving a car in foggy weather. You go slow, get lost often, and you hesitate a lot about what you should do. On the other hand, when you know the end destination, it is like driving a car in bright daylight, with your favorite music playing, and a GPS system guiding you along the way. You reach your destination much faster, it is more fun, and you know exactly what to do and when to do it.</p><p>Know your destination and where you are beginning; the middle will make itself up. With your leverage points, you will find a way to get what you want.</p><h2>6. Habits.</h2><p>Humans are a creature of habit; we tend to do the same things over and over again. You can think of habits as systems in your life that do the same thing repeatedly. To create and have effective habits, you will need these three components:</p><ul><li>Knowledge</li><li>Desire</li><li>Skills</li></ul><p>It is crucial to understand that we operate this way because this allows you to make your systems and processes more efficient. You can’t optimize something if you do not understand the underlying mechanics of it (knowledge). The desire, as part of your leverage points, will put you into action. What&#8217;s left is the skills that can translate that knowledge and desire into repeated processes.</p><div id=\"attachment_1129\" style=\"width: 385px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1129\" title=\"Effective Habits\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/effective_habits.jpg\" alt=\"Effective Habits\" width=\"375\" height=\"372\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Effective Habits</p></div><p>Fortunately, you have control over what your habits are. Some of your habits aren’t productive, whereas some of them are. You want to make most of your habits to be productive as possible and make your <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/025-mike-schmitz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">habits align with goals</a> you want to achieve.</p><p>Most people are not consciously aware of what habits they have. By bringing awareness to your habits you can start changing them to be aligned with what you ultimately want to achieve.</p><h2>7. Remove inefficiencies.</h2><p>Everyone has the same amount of time every day. Some people use their time more wisely than others. In every endeavor or project, there will always be limiting factors holding you back from progressing, and it is your job to remove all inefficiencies to maximize your use of time. Inefficiencies slow you down and waste valuable time and energy.</p><p>Sometimes the bottleneck is you. You can only do so much with the skills you have. Other times could be something else. Whatever it is, in order to move forward in the fastest way possible you have to remove all the inefficiencies. That could mean learning to say no to things and people, removing people from your life, <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/outsourcing/personal-outsourcing-how-to-get-more-than-24-hours-out-of-each-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personal outsourcing</a>, and many more, just to name a few.</p><p>Find the inefficiencies, and remove or optimize them for frictionless progress.</p><h2>8. Manage yourself.</h2><p>Everything starts with you. To be productive you have to use your mind and body in optimal form. It is key to understand how your body functions for you to allow to take full advantage.</p><p>It is a myth that you can work productively every hour of the day. Not all your energy gets used the same way. It goes against how our body functions because it goes through multiple different cycles within 24 hours. There are times when we can fully engage at what we are doing but also we need to allow ourselves to recover.</p><p>In the book <em><a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/power-of-full-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Power of Full Engagement</a></em> (<a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/books/the-power-of-full-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">review</a>), Tony Schwartz explains this concept by using an analogy of comparing sprinters and marathon runners. Both runners get over the finish line but do it in different ways. A marathon runner goes slow and steady whereas a sprinter fully engages in his running, disengages from it, and then goes back at it on the next sprint.</p><p>The latter is how we naturally function. When we are awake we can engage at what we do and then we renew ourselves when we sleep. In order to get the most leverage, you need to fully engage at the task at hand (that’s why we say <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/255-back-on-track/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multitasking is bad</a>) and renew your energy by disengaging from work.</p><p>Sprinters know what their destination is, engage in their sprints, take a break, and then focus again on the next sprint. That is one of the reasons why time-boxing techniques like the <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/motivation/become-more-productive-with-the-pomodoro-technique/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pomodoro Technique</a> work so well. On the other hand, a marathon runner is not fully engaged and he is pushing beyond his body’s natural level of capacity which causes unnecessary stress. That is why you will never see anyone work all 8 hours at full capacity. It goes against how our bodies naturally work.</p><p>Thus it is important to manage yourself to keep it aligned with how your body functions, and to manage your energy levels at all times. Your energy levels are the bedrock of getting things done because nobody can get work done when they are tired.</p><h2>9. Your own ecosystem.</h2><p>Everyone can be productive if they are put in the right environment. Your surroundings have a direct negative or positive influence on your productivity. We are often unaware of how our environment and surrounding affect us, but being aware of its components is a good step in the right direction. Your environment can consist of the following components:</p><ul><li>People (<a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/social/roommates-family-and-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most influential for your productivity</a>)</li><li>Location</li><li>Weather</li><li>Equipment</li></ul><div id=\"attachment_1127\" style=\"width: 496px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1127\" title=\"Your Productivity Ecosystem\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/productivity_ecosystem.jpg\" alt=\"Your Productivity Ecosystem\" width=\"486\" height=\"484\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/productivity_ecosystem.jpg 486w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/productivity_ecosystem-240x240.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Your Productivity Ecosystem</p></div><p>All these components are part of your own little ecosystem. What characterizes an ecosystem is that there are different components that all influence each other and work together.</p><p>Imagine you are an architect and you have the ability to design your own ecosystem. In essence, your living environment is like an ecosystem that you can set up to be productive, or not. The people you live with, the city you live in, the weather, and your workspace environment all affect each other and work in harmony. Most importantly, they all directly influence you and your personal productivity. Are they influencing you in a good way or a bad way?</p><p>Fortunately, you have direct control of how you design your ecosystem. Integrate all the optimized components together in your environment and when everything around you works together in harmony, it will push you to be productive. Set up your motivational triggers, surround yourself with the right people, have the right tools in your workspace, and manage yourself. All these factors are part of your ecosystem that will directly boost your productivity. Play architect and design your own ecosystem that will be your playground.</p><h2>10. You 2.0.</h2><p>No lazy person ever became successful. Nor do lazy people have time management skills. However, all successful people do have time management skills and to go to the next level, you as a person you need to go to the next level. You need to become your best self. Einstein put it best, “We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking we created them.”</p><p>Start by working in different areas of your life to improve:</p><ul><li>Health</li><li>Wealth</li><li>Education</li><li>Relationships</li></ul><p>All these factors when improved will directly impact your time management skills. Fortunately, there are ways to accelerate your path to become YOU 2.0. Specifically, seek out the following components:</p><ul><li>Mentors</li><li>Knowledge</li><li>Experiences</li><li>Models (see <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/systems/systems-thinking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">systems thinking</a>)</li><li>People networks</li></ul><p>These will put you on the fast track to become you 2.0 and to be an Efficient Asian.</p><p>Did you like this?

We recommend everyone to have a journaling ritual because it has so many benefits. Just to name a few:</p><ul><li><strong>Recorded memory.</strong> By writing things down, you have a record of what has happened to you, daily. This is especially great if you have a leaky brain (bad memory).</li><li><strong>Ability to see what you did</strong> on any given day of your life.</li><li><strong>See and track progress</strong> across different areas of your life.</li><li>A unique opportunity to <strong>align day-to-day task with longer-term vision and goals</strong>.</li><li>End every single day knowing that you did well – this creates <strong>motivational momentum</strong>.</li><li>Helps bring other Rituals into your life through questions and reminders.</li><li>Capture your own personal history.</li></ul><p>As part of our <a href=\"https://store.asianefficiency.com/rituals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rituals course</a> we&#8217;ve helped thousands of people with their journaling ritual. We have a whole module on how to build a journaling ritual inside the course and now we&#8217;re going to release the main video for free on the blog. You can watch it here:</p><p><iframe src=\"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/1mssvri68u?dnt=1\" title=\"Journaling Video\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wistia_embed\" name=\"wistia_embed\" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe><script src=\"https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js\" async></script></p><h2>Getting started with a journaling ritual</h2><p>Here&#8217;s a simple checklist to help you get started:</p><ul><li>Pick your medium – pen and paper, or digital.

Millions of people have now transitioned to working from home and are struggling to get anything meaningful done. For many of them, it’s their first time working from home which is challenging in itself let alone with the pandemic going on at the same time.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">While we&#8217;ve written about how to stay productive during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, there&#8217;s another thing happening that&#8217;s making it even harder to stay productive.</p><p>Recently, we had over 3.3 million unemployment claims in the United States in one week. That is the highest number of initial jobless claims in history since the Department of Labor started tracking the data in 1967. To put that in perspective, the highest average for a week previously was 695,000 in 1982. Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic we see a lot of businesses get shut down and people furloughed.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-record-coronavirus-unemployment-insurance-labor-recession-2020-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16006 size-full\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5e7ca11cba85ee447964b888-e1585788107774.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" /></a><br /> Credit: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-record-coronavirus-unemployment-insurance-labor-recession-2020-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Business Insider</a></p><p>When you&#8217;re concerned about losing your job it&#8217;s even harder to get focused. Last week I was talking to my friend Mel and she works as an accountant for a big luxury hotel chain. She told me all of her coworkers got furloughed and that she was afraid that she could lose her job anytime. With all the stress and uncertainty going on it has taken a major toll on her health, sleep, and productivity.</p><p>Three weeks earlier, she declined multiple job offers from big companies in different industries because she loved her employer and co-workers. “Thanh, I wished I had taken one of those offers because I could be working from home and still be working just fine without worries.”</p><p>Three days later, Mel got a letter that she was let go.</p><p>That’s just one of many stories I’ve heard from friends. The scary part is that this might just be the beginning as economists are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-jobless-claims-report-preview-economy-forecasts-coronavirus-unemployment-chart-2020-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicting a 32% unemployment rate by the end of next quarter</a>. So what can you do to prepare? How can you stay productive during these uncertain times?</p><h2>A Major Shift in The Way We Work</h2><p>It’s not all doom and gloom. One of the best things the pandemic has given us is that the work from home bubble has finally popped.</p><p>Back in 2009 when I started working from home, it was a novice concept. Between 2009 to 2017, <a href=\"https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/remote-work-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">there was a 159% increase in remote work</a>. In 2015, 3.9 million U.S. workers were working remotely. As of early 2020, that number is at 4.7 million, or 3.4% of the US population. With the pandemic, almost all people are now working from home because there is no other option.</p><p>However, many industries were resistant to change before the pandemic. There are so many industries where companies and people could have done their work remotely but resisted the change. Industries such as financial planners, medicine, law, dieticians, real estate, and the list go on. They could have done their work from home and still worked with their clients. Yet they didn’t.</p><p>Thanks to the pandemic everyone was forced to work from home and this also forced industries to adapt. They had no choice but to figure out a way to make a living. The veil has been dropped and now millions of people have had a taste of what the benefits are working from home. No more long commutes, a flexible schedule, fewer distractions&#8230;just to name a few.</p><p>The pandemic will be over at some point (hopefully sooner than later) and we’ll all go back to our “normal” lives. However, this pandemic will give many companies and people a new perspective on what a &#8220;client meeting&#8221; now looks like. Previously, it would have been meeting in an office. Today? It&#8217;s virtual. After the pandemic? It will likely be a combination of both. Financial planners can meet clients on a video conference call. Doctors can use telemedicine to diagnose patients without needing an office. The world will change and people will adapt to those new standards. We won’t completely eliminate in-person offices and visits but the time savings, convenience, and effectiveness of remote work will give many of us options that didn’t seem viable before.</p><p>So what does this mean for you?</p><h2>The Shift</h2><p>In this new economy where working remotely is going to become a new skill, the people that are going to be in the highest demand will be those who will be <strong>productive</strong> working from home. As we’re entering a new recession, companies will be cutting expenses, letting people go, and go remote. Some will go fully remote and many will introduce work from home days for their people to save costs and increase productivity.</p><p>While the pandemic affected us in negative ways, it was a blessing for the “work from home” movement. Post-pandemic we will live in a new world and economy where working from home will become widely accepted.</p><p><strong>But here’s the kicker</strong>: most people don’t know how to be productive working from home.</p><p>They like the idea but struggle with getting things done at home. Just check in with yourself here. Have you found it difficult to get work done at home?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/291-5-covid19-coronavirus-isolation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When we ran a survey of the Asian Efficiency audience</a>, many who started working from home for the first time and struggled. Even though they knew about Asian Efficiency strategies, they still struggled! Imagine everyone else who doesn’t know about Asian Efficiency&#8230;they don’t stand a chance to be productive at home.</p><p>It’s not their fault. No one has ever shown them how to be productive at home. Nobody told them the setup they need at home to be productive. Right now, there’s no resource or training for this. <a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/1/w015oao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">That’s about to change because we’re going to release a Work From Home training series that will help people be productive working from home in early May</a>.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been working from home since 2009 and Asian Efficiency is a 100% remote company. Everyone except one person had never worked remotely before until they started working at Asian Efficiency (the one exception is Brooks, my co-host of <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/291-5-covid19-coronavirus-isolation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Productivity Show</a>). I&#8217;ve trained single moms, corporate workers, entrepreneurs and a wide range of people to be productive working from home over the years and here’s what I discovered: everyone can be productive working from home.</p><p><strong>Yes, everyone can be productive working from home</strong>. It’s something everyone can get used to. Just think about the first time when you started working in an office setting. You were young, new to working in this type of environment, and eventually figured out how to get things done. It might have taken you a few weeks or months before you found your rhythm but eventually you got used to it.</p><p>If you ever switched careers, departments or jobs you’ve experienced the same feeling. You enter new territory and it takes a bit getting used to but eventually, you adapt and get stuff done. Usually, within a few weeks, you feel comfortable and can thrive.</p><p>Working from home is no different! You will feel out of your element at first because it’s new but if you do it long enough you’ll figure it out too. For some that might take a few weeks or months but right now you don’t have time to waste. As companies are laying off people and we’re entering a recession, you can’t afford to waste any time on “figuring out this work from home thing”.</p><p><a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/pah-webinar-registration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">That’s why we’re hosting a training</a> to show you everything you need to get set up at home, the perfect schedule for working from home, and how to focus at home (even if you have kids and another person living with you).

The guest was Tiago Forte (the creator behind Building A Second Brain) and we talked about his system for organizing ideas and information. If you&#8217;re a knowledge worker and are unorganized, <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/310-tiago-forte/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">then you need to check out this podcast episode</a>.</p><p>Most of you are dealing with lots of pieces of information like email attachments, digital notes, and ideas written down somewhere on our computer but you have no way of organizing all that information.</p><p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if you had all your knowledge and information organized? Wouldn&#8217;t be efficient to have everything easily accessible?</p><p>That&#8217;s what Tiago teaches for a living through his online courses. One of the things he&#8217;s known for is the <strong>PARA method</strong> which stands for:</p><ul><li>Projects</li><li>Areas</li><li>Resources</li><li>Archives</li></ul><p>It&#8217;s his organizational system to help you be more organized and creative. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you follow a productivity system already (like GTD, 12 Week Year, etc) because it&#8217;s a separate organizational system. In fact, it complements nicely with any personal productivity system you already have because who doesn&#8217;t benefit from a more organized projects, files, and ideas setup?</p><p>Everyone does! Including me.</p><p>The premise of building a second brain is just that &#8211; to have another brain that can store ideas and easily access bits of information you need, anytime. Imagine being able to find any idea you wrote down, files you downloaded, attachments on any of your devices within seconds. How much more efficient would you be?</p><p>Probably a lot!</p><p>I asked Tiago if he would be open to give a free training session to Asian Efficiency readers and he was excited about the idea. He&#8217;s a busy guy but we managed to find an afternoon to get him to help AE readers like you.</p><p>So if you want to learn how to build a second brain and become more organized, then I invite you to join us live next Monday on Aug 10th, it&#8217;s coming up real soon.</p><p><a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEpdOqurTIoE92szKWBzD4jy7k8Otv0rFD4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here&#8217;s the link to register for this free training</a>.</p><p>If you cannot make it live, don&#8217;t worry!

This would range from phone apps, books, electronic devices, to home appliances (not a joke). Our recommendations are based on how it helps us be more productive. Take, for example, a programmable coffee maker becomes a tool for productivity when you use it together with your morning ritual. You wake up, do your business in the bathroom and your coffee is already brewing. By the time you are done, your coffee is already waiting for you. </span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In this blog post, we are going to go over our top 10 purchases from last year that helped us in our productivity.

If you are used to moving your body and you stop, you will feel sluggish and will end up being unproductive. Plus you will not feel good about yourself. On the other hand, if you haven&#8217;t been exercising, perhaps you should start today with basic stretching exercises which can give you more <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/how-to-get-more-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy to get things done</a>.</p><p>We all know what a <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/kettlebell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kettlebell</a> looks like, but what is a macebar?

Once we got feedback that we need to add Windows, we listened and now, we always look for a Windows (or Android) counterpart.</p><p>Brooks is our Windows go-to person and after buying cheap (Windows) laptops and getting frustrated by it, he decided to invest in the <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/surface-pro-7-799/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surface Pro 7</a> and had zero regrets.

Well, I did. Boy was I wrong. The pro version is even so much better&#8211;not just design-wise but also because of its noise-canceling feature. The majority of the Asian Efficiency team uses this especially since we do have our daily meeting and also our meeting days. We also record a lot for our podcast, course materials, webinars, etc.</p><p>Going hands-free is the way to go when you attend virtual meetings because it gives you the freedom to walk around. Sure there are a lot of cheap options out there (and I have tried some of those) but the fit is often off, is painful to the ears, and doesn&#8217;t last long. The <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/Airpods-Pro/\">Airpods Pro</a> is sweat and water-resistant too.

I couldn&#8217;t run for more than 10 minutes because I was in agony. He used a stainless steel blade called a Gua Sha to release my leg muscles and then used a &#8216;muscle gun&#8217; (as I used to call it). It. Was. Painful. But in a good way. It released the tension on my leg and I was able to run again!</p><p>If you workout regularly, the <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/Theragun-PRO/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Theragun Pro</a> can help warm up your muscles and remove stiffness. It&#8217;s never a good idea to workout without warming up. The process of warming up before any form of exercise makes sure that you have enough oxygen in your muscles. You only need 30 seconds per muscle group to improve your performance and recover faster after each workout or training.</p><p>I own a different brand (ExoGun) just because Theragun is not available in my country. Thanh personally uses Theragun Pro.</p><h3>10. <a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/Raspberry-PI-Canakit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Raspberry Pi</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> ($35)</span></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/Raspberry-PI-Canakit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16183 size-large\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CanaKit-640x637.jpg\" alt=\"CanaKit\" width=\"640\" height=\"637\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CanaKit-640x637.jpg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CanaKit-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CanaKit-500x498.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CanaKit-768x765.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CanaKit-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CanaKit.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p><p>Before you go &#8220;what in the world?!&#8221; know that I also said the same thing.

Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Our goal by the end of the challenge is to give you the skills, habits, structure, and tools to work from home. We want you to be as productive at home as you are in the office (or even more so!).</p><p>Before we deal with all the distractions and challenges that working from home can throw at us, we need to deal with one significant roadblock: ourselves.</p><h2>A piece of advice that stuck</h2><p>Back in 2010, I left my corporate job in downtown Vancouver and planned to work from home.</p><p>Well, “planned” might be overstating it. I knew that I wanted to work from home. I knew that I wanted to take my kids to school, and I knew that I wanted to be home with them when school was out. I knew (more or less) what I would do throughout the day for work.</p><p>I can’t honestly say I had given too much thought about <em>how</em> I would work from home.</p><p>On my last day in the office, one of my soon-to-be-former coworkers pulled me aside with a concerned look on her face.</p><p>“Brooks,” she said, “my boyfriend works from home, and he does NOTHING all day. Make sure if you’re going to work from home, you treat it seriously. If you don’t, you’ll end up being lazy like him.”</p><p>My immediate thought was, “I wonder what my wife says to her coworkers about me,” but then I realized I had to do some thinking about how to work from home successfully. Clearly, it doesn’t just happen.</p><p>The first thing I did? <strong>Get dressed for work, even when working from home.</strong></p><h2>Why dressing for work is important</h2><p>At first, being able to work from home sounds great. You can roll out of bed, stumble over to your laptop in your pajamas or workout clothes, and go.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16001\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-robe.jpg\" alt=\"Laptop with Robe\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-robe.jpg 800w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-robe-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-robe-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-robe-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p><p>It is certainly <em>possible</em> to do that — after all, no one is going to send you home for your dress when you are already there.</p><p>However, getting dressed for work has three benefits that will make you more productive when working from home:</p><ol><li>It helps maintain some semblance of your routine. If you are switching from working in an office to working from home, getting dressed in the morning before you go to work will be at least one constant. And routines <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/206-overwhelm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are a strong defense against overwhelm and procrastination</a>.</li><li>Showering, doing your hair, and getting dressed up is a powerful signal to your brain that you are transitioning from “home time” to “work time.” This is especially important when you are living and working in the same physical location. It may be just a few feet between your kitchen table and your workspace (or your kitchen table may <em>be</em> your workspace), so you need all the help you can get to trigger the shift in mindset.</li><li>Getting dressed up for work is a signal to others in your home that you are switching from “home you” to “work you.”</li></ol><h2>What do we mean by “dress up for work”?</h2><p>We aren’t saying you need to put a suit and tie or your favorite power dress on when you get up in the morning (unless you think it will help you get focused).</p><p>It’s okay and only natural to be a bit more casual when working from home, although <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~ms4992/Publications/2015_Slepian-Ferber-Gold-Rutchick_Clothing-Formality_SPPS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies have shown</a> that more formal clothing encourages deeper and more perceptive thinking.</p><p>The key is to wear something approximating what you would wear to the office. Something that says to you and everyone around you “I’m working” vs. “I’m watching <em>Friends</em> on Netflix.”</p><p>Having said that, stores in the US are reporting that <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amid-coronavirus-walmart-says-its-seeing-increased-sales-of-tops-but-not-bottoms-202959379.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sales of tops are increasing, but not bottoms</a> because of the increase in Zoom and Skype calls. Walmart’s EVP of Corporate Affairs says:</p><blockquote><p>We’re seeing increased sales in tops, but not bottoms. So, people are concerned, obviously, from the waist up.</p></blockquote><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16002\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-shorts.jpg\" alt=\"Laptop with Shorts\" width=\"800\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-shorts.jpg 800w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-shorts-500x294.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-shorts-768x452.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laptop-shorts-640x377.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p><p>If you’re wearing sweatpants or shorts on your next Zoom call, your secret is safe with us.</p><h2>Exercise</h2><p>Now it is time for you to take action.

It&#8217;s something that everyone tries to do, but only a few people can actually make it work. The challenge most people face is committing themselves to the desired outcome they like to have. As soon the journey begins, obstacles and hurdles come up, and this is where most people end up quitting. Goal setting doesn’t have to be that way. With a few simple tips and tricks, you can make goal-setting work for you.</p><p><span id=\"more-1282\"></span></p><p>Brian Tracy wrote a great overview on goal setting in his book <em><a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/flight-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flight Plan</a></em>. He uses an analogy of a flight to explain the process of goal setting for personal success. Most flights will be off-course but they all reach their destination. Along the way the pilot has to deal with turbulence, crosswinds, storms, and lightning, which force him to make adjustments throughout the journey. That’s exactly how in real life goal-setting works. You know your destination and you work towards it, but inevitably you have to make adjustments along the way.</p><p>This is where time management comes in. Your time management skills will determine how well you adjust and thus how fast you will reach your goals. Remember, <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/what-is-productivity/\">productivity is the time you spend working towards your goals</a>. When you make adjustments, <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/goals/the-time-management-secret-that-will-eliminate-all-your-time-wasters/\">are they aligned with your goals</a>? For most people, knowing the destination is not the problem. What holds most people back is charting the destination, making the right adjustments, and sticking to it.</p><p>Here are some simple tips and tricks to make sure you reach your goals. In fact, you can break it down in five simple steps.</p><ol><li>Determine what you want to achieve.</li><li>Break down how you will get there.</li><li>Write it down.</li><li>Make it stick.</li><li>Do one thing every day that brings you closer to your goals.</li></ol><h2>1. Determine what you want to achieve</h2><p>This is the easiest part of goal setting. Just ask yourself, “<em>What is it that I would like to achieve within one year?</em>” One year is enough time to make a big goal a reality. To make it easy for yourself, stick to one big goal. If you have no clue where to start, pick one goal in one of the following areas of life:</p><ul><li>Health</li><li>Wealth</li><li>Relationships</li><li>Happiness</li></ul><h2>2. Break down how you will get there</h2><p>After you have determined what you would like to achieve, it gets more challenging. This is also the step where most people fall off the bandwagon. How are you planning to make your goal a reality? You need concrete steps to get to your destination. To fly from point A to B, you need to know the route. The same idea applies to goal setting.</p><p>A lot of people have the goal of becoming “a millionaire”, but then have no clue how to become one. Or someone wants to have a body like Zeus but is clueless on what to do. That’s why new years resolutions do not work, because it is just wishful thinking. You need clarity (one of the <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/mindsets/the-10-mindsets-of-productivity/\">essential productivity mindsets</a>) by having the steps outlined.</p><p>Figure out your game plan. Start with the end in mind and break down backward the steps it takes to reach your goal.</p><h2>3. Write it down</h2><p>To go from wishful thinking to actually achieving your goals, you need to write down your commitments. You have to tell your brain that you are serious about this endeavor by making it think there is an investment level. As humans, once we have invested into something, we hate losing our investment and we will do anything to keep it. By writing down your goals and steps, you have clarity but also you’re telling your brain “<em>Hey, see, this is important to me and I’m investing in it so let’s not drop the ball on this.</em>”</p><p>From my experience, writing it down on paper or on a whiteboard gives a stronger effect than typing it. So write down your goals and steps.</p><h2>4. Make it stick</h2><p>The destination is known, the map is clear, and the route is defined. All you have to do now is stick to the game plan. Unfortunately, this is another hurdle for most people that end up quitting on achieving their goals. The big key here is to keep reminding yourself of the goals you want to achieve. That statement is worth repeating.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Keep reminding yourself of the goals you want to achieve.</strong></p></blockquote><p>This is the process you want to keep up because it gives you the momentum to keep going. Motivation is a limited resource but it can be fabricated to help you stay on your path. Reminding yourself every day helps with this process. In fact, make it inevitable so you get reminded every day of your goal and you can do that by setting up your environment. Here are five tips to help you making it stick.</p><ul><li>Setup <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/motivation/how-to-motivate-yourself-with-motivation-pages/\">motivation pages</a>. Look at these every day. If you want to be a real Efficient Asian, <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/productive-morning-rituals/\">you make it part of your morning ritual</a>.</li><li>Surround yourself with the right people that align with your goals. <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/social/roommates-family-and-productivity/\">The closest people to you have a major impact on your productivity</a>. Make sure they are conducive to you. Many readers accomplish this inside our productivity community, <a href=\"https://shop.asianefficiency.com/dojo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Dojo</a>.

Choose when to do your planning and stick to it</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-15939\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Choosing-date.jpg\" alt=\"Choosing date\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Choosing-date.jpg 2121w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Choosing-date-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Choosing-date-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Choosing-date-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p><p>This is a crucial part when it comes to planning your week. You cannot just plan when you have time. You have to make time for it and make it as part of your ritual. Sticking to it every single week is one recipe for your success.</p><p>What works for me might not be the best for you. In choosing when to plan, it should be a day and time that you can consistently carve just for your weekly planning.</p><p>In my case, I do it every Sunday night, after dinner. This is usually the quietest part of my week and when everything at home has calmed down. Brooks does his planning every Sunday morning while Thanh does his Sunday afternoon. Others do it on a Saturday and some even during weekdays. What matters most is that you stick to it every single week.</p><p>Start with 30 minutes and eventually increase to 60 minutes. Think of it as your weekly <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/162-thinking-time/\">thinking time</a> where you can reflect on the week that just ended and plan for the week that&#8217;s about to start. This requires you to be present so make sure you are free from distractions. <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/plan-week-ceo/\">You can read about how Thanh plans his week as Asian Efficiency&#8217;s CEO here.</a></p><h3>2. Schedule what&#8217;s important for your week</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-15938\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Planning-Week.jpg\" alt=\"Planning Week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Planning-Week.jpg 2119w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Planning-Week-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Planning-Week-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Planning-Week-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p><p>If it&#8217;s not in your <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/schedule-management/how-to-use-your-calendar/\">calendar</a>, it probably will not happen because you will end up forgetting about it. During your weekly planning, think about all your <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/prioritize-todo-list/\">priorities</a> for the week, list them down, and add them to your calendar so that you consciously make time for it. Your calendar is a powerful tool that when used correctly, will help you achieve your goals.</p><p>It&#8217;s easy to miss important tasks when you don&#8217;t have a visual (whether analog or digital) reminder of it. It happened to me several times before&#8211;like forgetting to carve out time to pick up my daughter&#8217;s report card (oops) and her parent-teacher 1on1 (double oops).</p><p>When something unexpected pops up during the week, you can immediately look at your calendar and decide what you can move or not move to accommodate this surprise. You don&#8217;t have to panic since you have everything in place&#8211;you just have to move some pieces around.</p><h3>3. Review your previous week</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-15940\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Weekly-Review.jpg\" alt=\"Weekly Review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Weekly-Review.jpg 2121w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Weekly-Review-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Weekly-Review-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Weekly-Review-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p><p>The review process is vital for you to make the necessary adjustments and improvements to your weekly planning. Here are some questions you can ask during the review process:</p><ul><li>What went well?</li><li>What didn&#8217;t go well?</li><li>What can be better?</li><li>What improvements can I make?</li></ul><p>Those are just some questions you can use. Of course, feel free to add to it if it helps in your review.</p><p>It&#8217;s during this step that I realized how important it was to add all time-bound activities to my calendar because I tend to forget if I just file it inside my head.</p><p>It&#8217;s going to be useless to do a review if you do not do anything about it after. You can immediately make changes to your plans during your review</p><h3>4. Leave some room for surprises</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-15941\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Surprises-and-emergencies.jpg\" alt=\"Surprises and emergencies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Surprises-and-emergencies.jpg 2121w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Surprises-and-emergencies-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Surprises-and-emergencies-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Surprises-and-emergencies-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p><p>Whether you like it or not, it&#8217;s bound to happen every week. There are things you can control, but there are also a lot of things you can&#8217;t control especially if it involves other people (even technology).</p><p>Don&#8217;t go overboard and fill your calendar with things to do every 30 minutes&#8211;that&#8217;s overkill. Have enough <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/288-12-week-year/\">buffer time</a> that will allow you to accommodate any surprises that may arise.</p><p>Meeting a friend for lunch? Make it 3 hours instead of 2. Doing errands for the day? Make it 2 hours instead of 1. Going to the gym? I put in 2 hours even if it usually takes me an hour because there are times when traffic is bad or the gym is full.</p><p>Having this extra room to wiggle ensures that you don&#8217;t panic and end up canceling out on your priorities.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>These 4 steps are pretty simple and easy to follow. The key is consistency in doing it. Find out what day and time is best to do your planning and do it. List down your priorities and add those to your calendar while making sure that you have enough buffer time for surprises.</p> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 11:00:59 +0000","feedId":10782,"bgimg":"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Woman-reviewing-week-500x333.jpg","linkMd5":"0d07bafca8cfe9722e851b1c5126af50","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn41@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-10-892_37be955737a6983a.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":333,"sourceBytes":65149,"destBytes":27272,"author":"Marmel Becerial","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Woman-reviewing-week-500x333.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn41@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-10-892_37be955737a6983a.webp","http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Choosing-date.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-05-50-100_f1de31a9b25b6d58.webp","http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Planning-Week.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_6/2020/08/25/01-05-48-881_620d35bee24884c1.webp","http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Weekly-Review.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-05-50-068_71e7c4937fceb1af.webp","http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Surprises-and-emergencies.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn63@2020_3/2020/08/25/01-05-49-990_ce1e1a0d972631f5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317508241},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:08","title":"Our Top 10 Favorite Tools (not apps or software) Under $100","link":"http://www.asianefficiency.com/?p=15470","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15471\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tools-e1568042120263.jpg\" alt=\"Tools\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tools-e1568042120263.jpg 1000w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tools-e1568042120263-500x250.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tools-e1568042120263-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tools-e1568042120263-640x320.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p><p>Asian Efficiency is known for sharing productivity tips that we personally use because we are confident that it will help you out too. We have helped over 13000 people (maybe you are one of them!) take back their time and helped them focus on what was important.</p><p>This is why we are going to share 10 of our favorite tools that will not only help with your productivity but will also make your life a little bit more convenient and it won&#8217;t break the bank. You might still want to either get your wallet ready or make sure it&#8217;s far away from you.</p><p>These tools have been tried and tested by some (if not all) of the Asian Efficiency team. We will not be discussing apps because we already have a ton of that in the blog.</p><h2>Asian Efficiency&#8217;s Top 10 Tools Below $100</h2><h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D33RMRN/?tag=asianeffic-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HyperDrive USB C Hub &#8211; $89</a></h3><p>Technology is constantly evolving and sometimes, some of our tools are not always compatible or is late to the evolving game. One example would be the new MacBook Pro which has USB-C ports and does not have any USB-A port at all. Now, if you connect a lot of stuff to your laptop using the old USB port, it can be quite frustrating since you would have to use a lot of dongles (think of your ethernet cable, printer cable, flash drives, external HDD, at a lot more). It&#8217;s not only an eyesore, it&#8217;s also a recipe for &#8220;<em>Oh my, I left my dongle at home!&#8221;</em></p><p>The HyperDrive USB C Hub is perfect for the new MacBookPro because it attaches itself beautifully (yes, this is how I&#8217;m going to describe it since the opposite is just ugly) to the side of your MBP. I mean&#8211;look at it!</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15448\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HyperDrive-e1568042213413.jpg\" alt=\"HyperDrive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" /></p><p>It occupies two USB-C ports and before you go, what?!?!?! Don&#8217;t worry about it because the hub contains:</p><ul><li>2 USB-C ports (makes up for the two it occupies!)</li><li>Gigabit Ethernet Port</li><li>HDMI</li><li>SD</li><li>Micro SD</li><li>USB-A (hooray!)</li><li>Thunderbolt 3</li></ul><p>You can always purchase two and put one in your laptop bag for good measure.</p><h3>2. <a href=\"http://aelikes.com/c/s/ssz/P/5/zNZ/P/6TUInT/6jV0urZf8l/P/P/P\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gunnar glasses &#8211; $50</a></h3><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15452\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gunnar-Glasses-e1568042290942.jpg\" alt=\"Gunnar Glasses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"445\" /></p><p>Tell me of a day that you were not able to look at a screen? It could be a TV, computer, mobile phone, tablet&#8230; I think I haven&#8217;t gone on a &#8220;screen-less&#8221; day for the past 20 years. I earned a degree in computer programming so since I was in college, my face was basically in front of a computer every single day.</p><p>Now that we are (hopefully) more informed, we know that screens emit Bluelight that&#8217;s harmful to our retina, cataracts, and also increases your risk of getting a sleeping disorder.</p><p>There&#8217;s a reason why we always tell our readers that if you need to sleep make sure you stop using the computer or your phone an hour before bedtime&#8211;it&#8217;s the Bluelight.</p><p>But what if you don&#8217;t have that one hour? Since I work night shifts, I am directly in front of the computer up until I log out and then sleep. It&#8217;s a great thing that Thanh gave me a pair because it has been a lifesaver (or sleep saver). Right now, even if I am using my computer until the last minute before hitting the sack, I don&#8217;t have trouble falling asleep. Before, I would toss and turn for at least 30 minutes before I would finally fall asleep. We all know that sleep is a very important factor when it comes to productivity.</p><p>Aside from blocking harmful Bluelight and UV light, it also reduces eye strain. When you are facing the computer for at least 4 hours a day&#8211;you know what I am talking about.</p><h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Contigo-AUTOSEAL-Vaccuum-Insulated-Stainless-Travel/dp/B00HZI5XBG/?tag=asianeffic-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contigo AUTOSEAL West Loop Stainless Steel Travel Mug &#8211; $15</a></h3><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15446\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Contigo-471x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"471\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Contigo-471x640.jpg 471w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Contigo-368x500.jpg 368w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Contigo-768x1043.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Contigo.jpg 1105w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" /></p><p>Before you say &#8220;I don&#8217;t need another travel mug&#8221;, hear me out. You will never appreciate the importance of having an auto seal travel mug until such time that you end up with coffee on your pants or your shirt.</p><p>Yes. It&#8217;s AUTO SEAL. Meaning, after you take a sip, it auto seals itself. You don&#8217;t need two hands to drink and close since you only need to press one button. If you don&#8217;t press the button, no liquid will come out.</p><p>You only need to make sure that you close it properly when you fill it up and you can put it inside your bag without worrying that it&#8217;s going to spill.</p><p>Hot drinks stay hot for 5 hours and then 12 hours for cold drinks. It comes in three sizes and more than 15 colors.</p><h3>4. Electrolyte powders &#8211; $20</h3><p>As morbid as it sounds, dehydration is a silent killer. It&#8217;s also bad for your productivity since it lowers down your output. Did you know that if you are dehydrated even by just 3%-4%, your productivity is lowered down to 25%-50%? Mental ability or performance also decreases. This is also the same when you engage in physical activities like sports or when you regularly work out. If you are dehydrated, your physical performance also suffers.</p><p>So if you want to stay on top of your productivity and maintain peak physical performance, you need to keep yourself hydrated and electrolyte powders can help you with this.</p><p>Electrolytes not only make the most of your water, it also helps your body maintain its proper functions. If you get bored drinking plain water (trust me, there are people like that), then electrolyte powders can help since it&#8217;s flavored.

Since it&#8217;s 100% blackout, you don&#8217;t have to worry about waking up in the middle of your deep sleep. We all know sleep is important if we want to be productive. This is definitely a no-brainer purchase. Meaning, don&#8217;t think about why you should get one or why not. Just get one.</p><h3>9. <a href=\"https://www.tombihn.com/products/snake-charmer?variant=13209533251647\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tom Binh Snake Charmer (Small) &#8211; $28</a></h3><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15450\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tom-Binh-Snake-Charmer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tom-Binh-Snake-Charmer.jpg 600w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tom-Binh-Snake-Charmer-500x287.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p><p>Thirty years ago, utility bags were mostly make-up pouches. But now, small utility bags are needed because of all the gadgets we own. Laptops, mobile phones, tablets, earphones, headphones, smartwatches, and a lot more. However, not all bags are made the same. The Snake Charmer is more of an organizer pouch because of the compartments that you can use. The great thing about this bag is the heavy-duty mesh on each side. This allows you to actually see what&#8217;s inside.</p><p>It&#8217;s handy when you travel or even when you just decide to work in a coffee shop, you have all your wires in one place. You can also use it as a vanity pack. It comes in different sizes and colors. I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll find one that you will like (my personal choice is the Viridian 210 Ballistic).</p><h3>10. <a href=\"http://aelikes.com/c/s/ssz/P/N/z2n/P/6TUInT/sq7WcotV8C/P/P/P\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Memo water bottle &#8211; $15</a></h3><p>It&#8217;s a water bottle that&#8217;s not really shaped like a bottle.

When you have children at home, no co-workers, and a non-existent daily schedule it seems like it requires a lot of discipline, effort, and focus to get work done at home.</p><p>There’s some truth to that. When I first started in 2009, I had no clue what to do and <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/organization/asian-efficiency-guide-working-productively-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to be productive at home</a>. Through hundreds of experiments, I figured out how to be productive while working from home. This birthed Asian Efficiency where I was inspired to blog every week to help family and friends. This led to the creation of one of the most popular productivity blogs, <a href=\"http://theproductivityshow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Productivity Show</a> which is the #1 podcast on productivity with close to 9 million downloads, and <a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/focus-filter-evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dozens of courses</a> at the company.</p><p>Our goal at AE is to help people become more productive at work and in life. Now that we’re a few months in a pandemic, there’s one productivity strategy I’ve discovered that is powerful yet no one is talking about this. This has me very concerned because it’s going to lead to major troubles down the line.</p><h2>My Major Concern For Everyone Who’s Working Right Now</h2><p>Work and life seem to blend in and feel the same now. Everyone is working from home and there’s no clear separation between work and your personal life. Add in that we’re stuck, cannot go anywhere and there’s no clear end in sight for the pandemic, <strong>I forecast major burnout for many people in the next 6-12 months.</strong></p><p>This is what has me very concerned for everyone who’s fortunate enough to have a job and is working to pay their bills. While that is a blessing, I would caution you to pay attention to signs of burnout. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/high-octane-women/201311/the-tell-tale-signs-burnout-do-you-have-them\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">These include</a>:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/3-rituals-that-give-you-more-energy-and-double-your-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Physical and emotional exhaustion</a> &#8211; a lot of times</li><li>Detachment from work (lack of enthusiasm to show up for work)</li><li>Feeling ineffective, <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/15-ways-get-motivated-dont-feel-like-anything/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not motivated anymore</a></li><li>You’re sick more often than normal</li><li><a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/serene-sleep-evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You’re not sleeping much</a></li><li>Loss of appetite on a regular basis</li><li>Your productivity takes a major dip for a period of time</li></ul><p>Generally, you don’t have a positive outlook on work like you used to. I don’t want you to get to this stage because it can take months to recover from this (it took me 3+ months).</p><p>Now that most of you are new to working from home, you have to be very aware of this. Especially during the crazy times we’re in right now because you’re very susceptible to burnout. In a report from the <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_544138.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Nations International Labour Organization</a>, they&#8217;ve found that remote workers are working more hours and sometimes deal with more stress than their office co-workers do. As the owner of Asian Efficiency, <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/153-remote-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a fully remote company with people all over the world</a>, I&#8217;ve seen this to be true too for everyone that works here.</p><h2>The Counterintuitive Insight on Unlimited Vacation Days</h2><p>We have an unlimited vacation day policy at Asian Efficiency. People can take days off whenever they want to and there is no limit to this. I remember when I first introduced this in 2012, I was concerned that people would be taking 3-4 months off a year and that it would be unsustainable to run a company.</p><p>After the first year, we calculated the number of days each individual took off and averaged it out. The results shocked me.</p><p>Asian Efficiency team members, who were educated on productivity strategies and <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/downtime-and-breaks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the importance of downtime</a>, we&#8217;re still working more days than the average office worker in the US (which is notorious for only have 15 days off a year including sick days). The average came out to 13 days a year. Compare that to the average European country (anywhere between 25-33 days a year) and I quickly realized something wasn’t adding up.</p><p>It made no sense in my head. They had the option to take as much time off as they wanted and yet they still didn&#8217;t do it. It came to the point where I was forcing people to take time off. In on our 1-on-1 meetings and team meetings, I was telling individuals to leave work and enjoy some days off. If they showed up online on Slack or responded to comments on tasks, I would remind them to get off work. It was a real problem!</p><p>I&#8217;ve talked to other business owners who have similar vacation policies and they&#8217;ve found the same to be true. Remote workers work more than their office counterparts.</p><p>Over the years, our team members have gotten better at taking time off now. Last year, the average number of days off was 36. On our monthly meetings we check-in with everyone’s total days off (it’s on a spreadsheet for everyone to see) and if someone is not taking time off, we all sort of joke around and encourage that person to take some days off. Think of it as positive peer pressure. As a result, we’ve never had any burnout from anyone ever in our company history.</p><h2>What You Need To Do Now</h2><p>Now that you’re working from home during this pandemic, you might have found to be true too that you’re working more and taking fewer days off. You&#8217;re working longer hours, staying up later and you feel like work is more intense than ever before. I do believe that the pandemic has made work a lot more challenging &#8211; even for WFH veterans like myself.</p><p><strong>And this is where I believe one of the best strategies to stay productive during this time is to take time off</strong>. I&#8217;m forcing people at Asian Efficiency to take time off even if they cannot go anywhere. Every week on our team meetings, I’m reminding people to take days off so they don’t get burned out.</p><p>With eight years of experience and insights, I know that remote workers in our company aren&#8217;t going to take time off unless they have a special event to go to such as a wedding, anniversary, family get-togethers, and such. One might say it’s a great testament that people love what they do and it doesn’t feel like work. Part of me is very happy about that and at the same time, I’m also very aware <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/taking-frequent-breaks-key-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how important downtime is</a>. More importantly, how much burn out sucks. You feel unmotivated, your health takes a toll, and it can take months to recover from it.</p><p>With the world in a crisis right now and travel restrictions imposed, most of us cannot go anywhere and so we use work as an escape. This could easily lead to burnout and being stressed out. When we have the confluence of a pandemic, uncertainty of the future, financial concerns, working 12-16 hour days, conflicting news reports, and just everyday life&#8230;it can be tough on the mind and body.</p><p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling everyone at Asian Efficiency to take time off. I care about them, their well-being, and their families. Even if you cannot go anywhere, get your mind off work. You’ll come back refreshed and we’re in it for the long game.</p><p>It’s why we dedicated a whole module to this in our course <strong>Productive At Home</strong> that shows you how to be productive working from home.

It’s better to stop something bad from happening than it is to deal with it after it happened. I’ve had to learn this lesson the hard way multiple times throughout my life and <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/learning-relax-youre-driven-person/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I hope I can pass on that wisdom to everyone else here today</a>.</p><p>I&#8217;ve taken it a step further by introducing a 4-day workweek for the whole month of July. It&#8217;s the first time we&#8217;re doing this at Asian Efficiency and we&#8217;re all excited to see how it goes. It&#8217;s also my way of introducing a systemic approach for everyone to take time off on top of other days they have scheduled off because I know remote workers tend to not take days off.</p><p>Leading up to our 4-day workweek in July, I&#8217;ve been taking a 6-week 4-day work week and I&#8217;ve found myself more rejuvenated and excited than ever before. During these crazy times, I needed this more than I thought I would.</p><p>So I encourage you to take days off even if you have nowhere to go. There&#8217;s plenty of things you could be doing:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/serene-sleep-evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sleeping in and taking a real nap for the first time in forever</a></li><li>Run errands while everyone else is not around</li><li>Get back into reading books and magazines</li><li>Watch Netflix and TV all day without any guilt</li><li>Workout again</li><li><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/organization/20-efficient-home-care-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pick up the self-care routine that you’ve missed</a></li></ul><p>Pick one thing to do on your day off and you&#8217;ll come back excited for work and have a new sense of excitement for life.

We&#8217;re nearly at the end of the challenge but if you just started today, no worries! You can still do the previous challenges:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-1-dress-for-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Day 1 &#8211; Dress For Work</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-2-daily-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Day 2 &#8211; Your Daily Reset</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-3-create-time-and-space-to-focus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Day 3 &#8211; Create Time And Space To Focus</a></p><p>&#8230; and now that you&#8217;re done with the previous three, it&#8217;s time to make sure you don&#8217;t get burnt out working from home.</p><h2>The Burn-Out</h2><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so lucky you work from home! You have a lot of time to work since you don&#8217;t have to prepare and commute.&#8221;</p><p>That&#8217;s not true.</p><p>People think that just because you work from home, you have all the time in the world since you&#8217;re just at home. You can work anytime. That may be partially true but they forgot to mention that you can still get burnt out when you are working from home because you&#8217;re still working, thinking and actively doing things.</p><p>You still have to prepare for work and do a daily reset just like what we talked about during the <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-1-dress-for-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1st</a> and <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/work-from-home-day-2-daily-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2nd</a> day of our challenge.</p><p>Whether you are single or in a relationship, you also have other responsibilities outside of work. These responsibilities do not stop when you are working from home. We&#8217;re not (just) talking about picking up the groceries and paying bills. You have a responsibility to take care of yourself too (self-care).</p><p>At Asian Efficiency we teach the <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/tea-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TEA Framework</a>. When you master Time, Energy, and Attention you will be Asian Efficient. When you work from home, you have more time than those who have to commute. What about your energy and attention? After working from home for many years, I’ve discovered that <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/increase-energy-productivity-breakthrough/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">managing your energy</a> is even more important when you’re at home.</p><h2>It&#8217;s All About Energy</h2><p>When you have the time but not the energy to get things done, you are exhausted. Whether you work in an office or at home, that doesn’t differ. I remember Thanh&#8217;s story. One Sunday, he told himself that he will do his taxes. He blocked his entire Sunday just to do his taxes &#8211; he had all the time to it. But he didn&#8217;t end up getting it done. He lounged around and stayed in bed for a long time and just spent the entire day doing other things except for his taxes. When he was journaling that night, he realized that it wasn&#8217;t time that he lacked. He had a whole day for it. What he lacked was energy to do it.</p><p>It&#8217;s the same thing when you procrastinate. Even when you have made the time and have planned out on what you want to do, when you lack energy, you will procrastinate.</p><p>You deplete your energy in several ways:</p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lack of sleep or not getting quality sleep</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the food you eat</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inactivity (sedentary lifestyle)</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dehydration</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stress</span></li></ul><p>A lot of the things mentioned above, YOU HAVE CONTROL over. But there is something else that you can do to ensure that you always have the energy to finish your tasks every single day.</p><p>Take a break.</p><p>Taking breaks is important for those working from home. Otherwise, you risk of burning yourself out and getting cabin fever. It’s what people describe as “going crazy” when they first start working from home. They’re not taking breaks!</p><p>Several studies prove just how important breaks are. According to a study by <a href=\"https://cdntorkprod.blob.core.windows.net/docs-c5/763/185763/original/tork-takes-back-survey.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tork</a>, 90% claim that they feel more refreshed and ready to work after their lunch break. Another study of <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PNAS</a> states that breaks can help prevent decision fatigue especially for roles where you need to make frequent decisions. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/minding-the-body/201603/become-better-writer-be-frequent-walker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Psychology Today&#8217;s</a> research says that breaks increase creativity AND productivity.</p><p>Imagine as if you&#8217;re running. Can you run for 8 hours straight at the same pace as when you started and not feel tired at all?</p><p>When you drive a car, you can&#8217;t go on forever either. You would need to stop at one point to fill up your tank.</p><p>You are no different. You use your brain a lot when you are working. It will get tired and if you do not let it recover, you will be exhausted and feel burnt out.</p><h2>When And How To Take A Break</h2><p>I used to be very bad at taking breaks. I had to install a <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/motivation/pomodoro-technique-ultimate-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pomodoro timer</a> on my computer so that it will remind me to take a break. These days, I no longer need it, but if you struggle to remember to take breaks, it is a great solution.</p><p>Now that you know when to take a break, here’s how to use that break wisely. Scrolling through your Twitter feed is not a good example. You might end up feeling riled up because of something you&#8217;ve read. Facebook is another no-no. Stay clear from social media.</p><p>Instead, <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/how-to-get-more-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">do some energizing activities</a>. Stretch your muscles. Go for a short walk. Do some breathing exercises. Do 10 burpees or even jumping jacks.

You never know what is going to happen on a given day. Sometimes what has always worked stops working. When something happens that changes the game, it can cause fear, doubt, and worry. Change can be difficult, but there is no formula for success that does not include change. Instead of being afraid, a healthy way to see change is to view it as a pivot towards success.</p><h3>What is a pivot?</h3><p>In her book, <em><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/pivot-jenny-blake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One</a>, </em>author Jenny Blake defines a pivot as &#8220;to switch quickly and successfully from one trajectory to the next.&#8221; Pivot towards success means one is willing to face the fear of change and discover the opportunities that each new day brings.</p><h3>Case study: Restaurant owner Nick Kokonas</h3><p>One of the industries most impacted by the recent worldwide pandemic is food and hospitality. Owners of thriving restaurants were forced to close their doors. Restaurants went from operating at near capacity before the coronavirus to zero customers.</p><p>A case in point is the innovative leadership of entrepreneur Nick Kokonas. Nick is the founder of the phenomenally successful <a href=\"https://www.alinearestaurant.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alinea</a> restaurant in Chicago. Alinea is world-renowned and has been awarded almost every accolade possible in the industry. Nick also built the best in class Tock application, a reservation management platform for restaurants.</p><p>According to an article published by <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90490819/restaurateur-nick-kokonas-isnt-waiting-for-congress-to-come-to-his-rescue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast Company</a>, he converted his restaurants in the Alinea group from elite dine-in experiences to high-quality carry-out services.</p><p>First, he adjusted the menu. A typical customer at Alinea was paying an average of $375 per person. The chefs found a creative way to prepare a carry-out meal that met their standard of excellence but could be sold at a price point for less than $40 per person. It was a savings of 90% for their customers.</p><p>Second, he leveraged the technology of the Tock application to facilitate carry-out orders instead of table reservations. Instead of having a crisis-reaction, Nick and his team approached the problem with creativity and innovation. Nick said, &#8220;It&#8217;s about making a bridge to the future and keeping our businesses viable so that they can reopen.&#8221;</p><h4>What does that mean for me?</h4><p>Nick is a restaurant owner that wanted to continue selling food. He had to find a new way to be successful because of changes that were beyond his control. You can do the same thing. If you embrace change, you can find new ways to be productive and successful.</p><p>Although no two situations are identical, there are basic elements that make up a successful pivot.</p><h2>Here are three simple ways to embrace change and stay productive</h2><h3>1. Ask yourself clarifying questions</h3><p>Not long ago, I left a company where I worked for more than twenty years. Everything normal for me was changing. I needed a clear direction for my future. As a productive person, I wanted to do something, but I knew that I needed to clarify my thoughts.</p><p>I took a simple inventory of my life. I asked myself <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/how-to-embrace-failure-and-bounce-back-strong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what makes me happy</a>. Next, I thought about my skills, my education, and my work experience. Finally, I realized that writing is my greatest passion. My love for writing is an unchanging constant in my life. It has always been the most meaningful part of my work. Once it was clear in my mind, I had the confidence to pursue a career as a writer.</p><h4>Here are some questions you can ask yourself to clarify your thinking</h4><p>1.

Identify opportunities</h3><p>I have a friend who owns a small café. It is a one-person operation, but no less a successful business than a large corporation like Alinea. My friend closed the doors to her cafe, like all other restaurants. The COVID-19 crisis forced her to make changes.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-16193\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Johanna-Cestas-375x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Johanna-Cestas-375x500.jpeg 375w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Johanna-Cestas-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Johanna-Cestas-480x640.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" /></p><p>After some time to clarify her thoughts, she realized there was an opportunity to do something new. It was near Mother&#8217;s Day. She realized people want to give gifts to their mothers, but normal shopping was not possible because most of the retail stores were closed too. She used her resources to design some gift-baskets that could be delivered to a customer&#8217;s home. Not only was it a great success, but it was the genesis for a new business venture that will continue even when the cafe returns to regular operation.</p><p>A few weeks later, when businesses opened again, I was in a coffee shop talking with one of the employees while I waited on my order. I mentioned the new business selling gift baskets, and it immediately sparked a positive reaction. It was clear that there was an interest in this type of personalized delivery service in the city where I live. When the doors to the restaurant closed, the door of opportunity opened to sell gift baskets.</p><h4>The discovery process made simple</h4><p>The opportunities to pivot may look different in your city or within your company, but there is something new waiting for you to discover it. It may even be an idea you already have in your mind. Now is the time to make a move towards it.</p><p>At first, it may seem overwhelming. We know how you feel, and we can help you <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/4-steps-to-escaping-overwhelm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deal with the feeling of being overwhelmed</a>. Making important decisions about your life, your education, or your career can be intimidating, but there is no need to be afraid. I promise you can do this. Don&#8217;t think about it as a mountain that is too high to climb. Instead, see it as a process with some simple steps. Each step takes you closer to your goal. When you arrive, you will feel so much relief. It will give you the confidence to move forward.</p><h4>Here are some practical ways you can identify opportunities without being overwhelmed.</h4><p><strong>1. Idea generation</strong></p><p>Make a list of all of those ideas you have had in the past about how things could improve or something you always wished you could do. You will be surprised how many great ideas are just waiting to surface when you make time for discovery. Many people are visual thinkers, and making a mind map can be a very effective way of collecting and organizing your ideas. For a better understanding of how effective mind-mapping can be for idea generation, read this great article on <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/technology/brainstorming-mind-maps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Effective Brainstorming Using Mind Maps</a>.</p><p><strong>2. Alignment</strong></p><p>A great place to start is by recognizing how your knowledge and skills may be perfectly aligned with a new opportunity.</p><p><strong>3. Network</strong></p><p>Sit down with a trusted friend and brainstorm ways to innovate in your city or company. Saying things aloud is another excellent way to activate your creativity. Some of the best ideas are born in this kind of spontaneous moments. Creative thinking does not have to be hard. In fact, we have a great resource to help you <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/how-to-identify-and-overcome-the-mental-blocks-that-slow-your-creativity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unlock your creativity</a>.</p><h3>3. Define your next move</h3><p>My friend, who is launching a new business selling gift baskets, proved the concept by selling them on Mother&#8217;s Day weekend. It was an experiment. She took a small step in the direction of her vision for the future. She started with an idea, but she found success because she made a move.</p><p>Successful people recognize that there is always a next move. When you do a deep dive into a subject like embracing change and making plans for your future, it can produce a lot of ideas. Ideas alone are not enough. You need to transform your ideas into actions.

I am a big believer in <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/240-personal-development-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ongoing education and development</a>, so I always have at least one course or tutorial on the go.</p><p>I had set a goal to complete a “full-stack developer” course that I had purchased on a Black Friday sale. I was enthusiastic about it, but there were a few problems:</p><ul><li>I haven’t done software development as a job since 2002.</li><li>Sometimes I do some coding here at AE, but it’s not (currently) using any of the technologies that were in the course.</li><li>It was an extremely long course, and I started getting disillusioned around the 21% mark.</li><li>I realized fairly quickly that the instructor and course materials weren’t great.</li></ul><p>On the flip side…</p><ul><li>I didn’t spend a ton of money on the course, but I did spend some. It would be a shame to “lose” it. (My college Management Accounting teachers would have a heart attack if they heard me say that.)</li><li>I am an insane completionist, and I have trouble stopping things once I start.</li><li>You never know, I might learn something that can improve how we do things at AE.</li><li><em>Nerd Alert</em> I do find the topic quite interesting, and it was a subject I wanted to learn more about.</li></ul><p>As an outsider looking in, it might seem obvious what I should do, but we humans are often horrible at this type of self-reflection, and we often don’t give this type of thought to our goals once we make them.</p><p>At the best of times, it can be hard to know what to prioritize. You may be feeling like you can’t get everything done in the time that you have — a lot of us do — so any time we spend on things that we shouldn’t compounds the problem.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve been in a similar situation. You’ve chosen (or been given) a goal, and you’re not sure if you are wasting your time or not. We understand, and we’ve helped hundreds of people in your situation.</p><p>So if you’re thinking of pursuing a goal, but you’re not sure if it is right for you, or if you’re partway through the year and have doubts if it is worth completing a goal, or if you always set goals and then flame out after a while, this article is for you. We’ll be sharing a framework you can use to figure out if a goal is still worth pursuing.</p><h2>It’s Not Only About Dropping A Goal</h2><p>So far, we’ve been talking about dropping a goal you’re not sure of, but that won’t always be the case. By doing some proactive evaluation, you’ll have one of two outcomes:</p><ol><li><strong>Yes, Let’s Go!</strong> You’ve looked at the goal, and even if you have some doubts, you’ve found that it is worth pursuing after all. That’s great! Now you know you should <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/209-focus-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make sure you have the time to focus on it</a>. We have lots of <a href=\"https://shop.asianefficiency.com/dojo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resources in our Dojo community to help</a>.</li><li><strong>Drop It Like It’s Hot</strong> The goal seemed like a good idea at the time, but now — not so much. That’s OK! Now you have time to focus on other, more impactful things. Dropping a goal isn’t a failure; it’s a long-term win.</li></ol><h2>How Do You Figure Out if a Goal Is Worth Sticking With?</h2><p>With all that said, let’s take a look at how you can decide if your goal is something you should continue working towards</p><h3>1. Reflect: Do you have a strong WHY?</h3><p>Think about the goal you’re evaluating. Why did you want to do it in the first place?</p><p>Most of us skip spending time on this, which is a big mistake, but it’s a mistake you can undo now.</p><p>If you are honest about your “Why,” that will significantly inform your next steps. If you can’t come up with a good reason to do it, that’s a big red flag. There’s a very high chance that you should drop, or significantly change, the goal.</p><p>We talk about this more in our article <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/goals/goal-setting-and-getting-having-a-why/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goal Setting and Goal Getting: Having a Why</a>.</p><p>There are two useful exercises you can use to drill down on your “Why”:</p><ol><li><strong>The Five Whys</strong> exercise. Often, the real reason we want to do something is not the first thing to come to mind. The Five Whys exercise is like peeling an onion. You ask “Why” five times, and go deeper and deeper until you get to the core reason. <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/motivation/why-willpower-doesnt-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can see an example of the Five Whys exercise here</a>.</li><li><strong>Thinking Time</strong>. Use specially set aside thinking time to ask yourself questions, dig into ideas, and get into the right mindset and mental framework. We talked about this in our <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/162-thinking-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thinking Time podcast episode</a>, and we have a course about it in <a href=\"https://shop.asianefficiency.com/dojo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Dojo</a>.</li></ol><p>By reviewing your goal against your true why you’ll a) have an idea whether you should proceed or not, and b) will be more likely to stick with it through to completion. Whenever things get bumpy, your why can keep you going.</p><p>Using my course as an example, here’s how things came out:</p><ul><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/274c.png\" alt=\"❌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> The fact that I spent money on the course is not a good reason to keep going — <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/mindsets/sunk-costs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sunk cost fallacy</a>.</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/274c.png\" alt=\"❌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Completing something for the sake of completing it makes no sense.</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Spending time learning something is better than watching Netflix or scrolling TikTok.</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Skills I pick up may enable us to do more cool things at AE or might help me in my later career.</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Learning something I enjoy but is not-directly-work-related is good for my brain and makes me happy.</li></ul><p>So far, I’d say we are edging on continuing with the goal, so we shall see what happens. I won’t drop it yet.</p><h3>2. Evaluate your current situation</h3><p>Whenever I’ve run into trouble with a goal, it is usually because the goal <em>sounded</em> great, and maybe the whys even checked out, but there was no realistic chance that the goal could have succeeded. If I were honest with my self or proactive, I would have realized this.</p><p>Look ahead. What are your:</p><ul><li><strong>Work commitments</strong>. Do you have big projects coming up that might impact your ability to achieve this goal?</li><li><strong>Family commitments</strong>. Do you have to take the kids to activities, help them with homework, care for elderly parents, or have a limited family time?</li><li><strong>Energy constraints</strong>. Are you wiped out after work or during the day? Do you have energetic time where you could truly focus on this goal?</li><li><strong>Financial constraints</strong>. Can you afford to achieve this goal, or would spending money on it cause you other problems?</li><li><strong>Economic factors</strong>. Is there anything going on (like, say, a recession or global pandemic) that might interfere with achieving your goal?</li></ul><p>If you think through your time, energy, and resources available, you should have a clearer idea of whether you can and should continue.</p><p>There’ll usually be one of three outcomes:</p><ol><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f645-200d-2640-fe0f.png\" alt=\"🙅‍♀️\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><strong>Not going to happen</strong>: The situation just isn’t going to allow this goal to be successful. Better to pull the plug now.</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f57a.png\" alt=\"🕺\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> <strong>Looks good</strong>: You have the <a href=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/tea-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">time, energy, and attention</a> resources to be successful with this goal. Carry on.</li><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f9d7-200d-2640-fe0f.png\" alt=\"🧗‍♀️\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> <strong>There’s a gap</strong>: There’s a gap between what you want to do and what you can do, but it should be possible to close that gap. What are you willing to sacrifice to achieve the goal?</li></ol><p>Evaluating my course goal:</p><ul><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> I can plug away at the course a little every day (or every few days). Even on days that I’m tired, doing a programming tutorial is not exactly working in a coal mine. If it is a priority for me, I can do it.</li></ul><h3>3. Break the goal down</h3><p>Often when our goals are “big,” they just seem unmanageable, and it is hard to start and keep progressing.</p><p>Usually, when that happens, it is a sign that the goal needs to be broken down or re-written.</p><p>We talk about this as one of our <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/goals/5-steps-setting-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Simple Steps to Setting Goals and Achieving Them</a> — do you know how to achieve what you want to achieve?</p><p>You may have created a goal at the start of the year or quarter, but didn’t adequately break down how you’re going to do it.</p><p>Breaking a goal down into smaller, more manageable pieces will help you <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/gtd-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">determine your next actions</a>.</p><p>An important question about breaking down a goal: What if you don’t know everything you need to do to achieve your goal?</p><p>There’s a misconception that to break down a goal, you need to be able to <em>completely</em> break it down. If you can do that, that’s great! But sometimes it is not possible. Sometimes we don’t have the knowledge or clarity yet to know everything.</p><p>That is entirely normal. Even if you don’t know everything you need to do, there’s a good chance that you at least know the first two or three things. Start with that, and then you can continue when you get there.</p><p>Looking at my course goal:</p><ul><li><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/26a0.png\" alt=\"⚠\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Breaking down my development course, I realized that the problem wasn’t the Why or the Situation. The problem was that the specific course itself just wasn’t good. If I could shift the goal to have a similar outcome, but with better materials and a smaller time commitment, I could still keep the goal.</li></ul><h3>4. Start executing</h3><p>Making a goal is easy. Consistently executing on your goal and making progress? Not so easy.</p><p>The best way to beat the odds is to create daily rituals and systems to take you there.</p><p>Here are some resources to help:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/why-habits-dont-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Reasons Why Habits Don’t Work (And Why You Need Rituals Instead)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/revisiting-the-12-week-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 12 Week Year: The “Secret Sauce” To Achieving Your Goals Every Quarter</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/293-perfect-week/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How To Plan Your Perfect Week In Under 45 Minutes</a></li></ul><p>If you want to kick-start your goal execution, <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/announcements/dojo-2-0-turn-knowledge-into-action/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check out our “Do The Damned Things” calls</a>.

Use the Five Whys exercise if necessary.</li><li>Look at your time, energy, financial, and attention circumstances &#8211; what could get in the way of you completing this goal?</li></ul><p>If you’re wondering — the outcome of my goal is I dropped the course I purchased and found another one. It is much better, and now I’m enjoying working towards my goal instead of dreading it.

In the past, we’ve done other challenges on focus, personal automation, and email, and they’ve been popular. Here is what some of the AE readers have had to say…</p><blockquote><p>I did this challenge 17 months back and it was phenomenal. Now reading it over again still makes so much sense. &#8211; Amratansh</p><p>Mind. Blown. How is it that something so BRILLIANT is so ‘unknown’?? &#8211; Katie</p><p>I am learning so much and it’s so easy. I will also say, very helpful. I completed all the challenges. &#8211; Rose</p><p>This is a powerful tool. My life has gone through a lot of changes in the past 2 years. And I need to be more concrete on the next few years ‘ direction. Mapped and laid out. &#8211; Marian</p></blockquote><p>We’ve found that there’s nothing like a challenge to encourage us all to start taking concrete action. It doesn’t hurt when there are prizes involved too!</p><h2>We’ve been working from home for more than a decade</h2><p>When we started putting together this Work From Home challenge, it made me wonder: how long <em>have</em> I been working from home, anyways?</p><p>I pulled up my Record of Employment (Canadian thing) from my last corporate job, and to my surprise, my last day was March 31, 2010. So I’ve officially been working from home for over 10 years now.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15992\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-roe-640x69.png\" alt=\"BD Record of Employment\" width=\"640\" height=\"69\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-roe-640x69.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-roe-500x54.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-roe-768x83.png 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bd-roe.png 818w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p><p>Thanh has been working from home for even longer — 12 years — and Asian Efficiency has been a remote company from Day 1.

Here’s how it will work:</p><p>During the week, we will be posting <strong>ONE</strong> new tip each day, starting <strong>Monday, April 20</strong>. We designed these tips to help you develop your work-from-home skills and give you the tools and techniques that will help you thrive.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>For each tip, there’ll be an exercise so that you can put your new strategy into action.</p><p>For this first pre-lesson, your homework is simple — comment below to let us know that you’re in, and if you’re a Twitter user, click this button to share that you’re taking the 5 Day Work From Home Challenge:</p><p><a href=\"https://ctt.ac/UL3wI\" target=\"\\_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://clicktotweet.com/img/tweet-graphic-4.png\" alt=\"Tweet: I'm starting my Asian Efficiency 5-day Work From Home challenge!

Let’s explore why that’s the case, then look at several hobbies you could try that may help you make the most of your efforts on the job.</p><h2>Your Hobbies Could Help You Learn New Skills</h2><p>Due to a fear of stepping too far outside of their comfort zones, many people stick to hobbies that are somewhat related to their jobs or things they already know they can do well.</p><p>However, a study from San Francisco State University involving nearly 350 employees found that when people participate in hobbies, they often make job-related improvements.</p><p>The scientists aren’t sure why that’s the case, but they suspect it’s because people <a href=\"http://time.com/65487/being-creative-outside-of-work-makes-you-better-at-your-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">learn new things while doing hobbies</a> that they can later apply to their work.</p><p>As a result, productivity goes up, and individuals become well-versed in capabilities that fit with the things they do while on the clock.</p><h2>They Force You to Manage Your Time Wisely</h2><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-13608\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-4-768x512.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" /></p><p>Taking up a hobby usually requires rearranging your schedule to fit in the new activity. Plus, you have to stick to that plan or risk letting your work duties suffer or having to give up the pastime. If you need extra motivation to become a better manager of your time, a new hobby could provide the assistance you seek.</p><p>People typically feel proud of themselves for taking the initiative and learning something new, and they don’t want to become ashamed after finding out they can’t manage their time well enough to sustain the commitment the new activity needs. That’s especially true if a hobby involves a teacher or a team. When other people depend on you, you’re more likely to stay dedicated.</p><p>You can probably relate to how people are generally conscious of what others think of them. They could feel embarrassed by admitting to others that they can’t sufficiently work out their schedules to include both a hobby and work.</p><h2>Hobbies Help You Think About Obstacles in Different Ways</h2><p>Running into an intellectual roadblock that gives you the impression that’s no way to solve a certain problem can make your productivity plummet. However, an analysis suggests that having hobbies stimulates your mind to <a href=\"https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/07/are-hobbies-the-key-to-creative-breakthroughs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">come up with innovative ideas</a>.</p><p>You might experience something while doing a hobby that gives you an alternative perspective on a task at work or makes you realize a difficult responsibility at work is not as hard as it seemed at first.</p><p>Also, you may want to prioritize hobbies that allow you to interact with others. In situations that permit giving and receiving feedback, you may confide in another person and admit you’re dealing with a problem at work that has you feeling stumped.</p><p>Sometimes the fresh perspective provided by another individual could be what’s needed to see you knew the answer all along but weren’t looking at the scenario with the proper perspective.</p><h2>They Increase Patience and Willingness to Work Toward Long-Term Goals</h2><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-13610\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-2-768x512.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-2-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-2-640x427.jpeg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-2.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p><p>Although some aspects of productivity and creativity require short bursts of work, they also involve pouring your efforts into an objective that may take years to achieve. Think about your favorite composer or inventor. There’s a good chance the product of that person’s work ethic didn’t manifest overnight. It probably took months, and most likely, years.</p><p>Taking part in a hobby often involves learning smaller skills you can combine to get closer to a bigger goal. Think of playing the guitar as an example. Before learning advanced barre chords that require using at least one finger to hold down several or all of the strings at once, you’ll probably master significantly easier chords that might only need pressure put on two strings.</p><p>Regardless of the hobby chosen, that kind of progressive learning naturally teaches patience. When you have a more patient mindset about the things you set out to do, it could help you more easily see that it’s worthwhile to set your sights on productivity or creativity goals even if you don’t accomplish them for a while.</p><p>Patience is also closely associated with self-control, and scientists have found a link between greater levels of self-control <a href=\"https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/the-lifetime-effects-of-self-control-in-childhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and having better health</a>. Furthermore, when people practiced self-control as kids, they were more likely to see its positive effects as adults.</p><p>Maybe self-control has never been one of your strong points, but it’s never too late to start developing it. You could see benefits such as not getting angry if things don’t go your way. It’s likely you’ll realize that not giving in to some of your unhealthy or counterproductive impulses while at work could help you get more done and improve the overall quality of your performance.</p><h2>Having Hobbies Could Make You Less Stressed</h2><p>When you feel upset due to stress, reduced productivity often follows. If that happens, you may begin engaging in a harsh internal dialogue with yourself that blames other factors besides the stress, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle. However, a 2015 study found that people who <a href=\"https://www.ucmerced.edu/sites/ucmerced.edu/files/documents/zawadzki-paper-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spent time doing leisure activities</a> experienced less stress, had lower heart rates, and felt calmer than when they were not doing those things.</p><p>People often have good intentions of starting hobbies but never take the steps necessary to do so. If that sounds familiar, consider that your decision to take up a hobby could promote relaxation and stress relief, making you more able to excel while on the job.</p><h2>Hobbies Help You Recover From Demanding Days</h2><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-13609\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-1-768x512.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-1-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-1-640x427.jpeg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-1.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p><p>Many people who strive for consistent productivity or creativity find it’s sometimes hard to stay on track because they don’t have sufficient recovery periods during their leisure time. That phenomenon frequently becomes more problematic when people blur the lines between work and pleasure by doing things such as taking career-related paperwork home with them at night to read outside of work hours.</p><p>However, a 2016 study that highlighted the recovery periods of people working at a hospital found that a cultural — and preferably creative — activity encourages recovery from taxing work and increases the likelihood of mastery.</p><p>Also, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4939860/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">41 percent of the hospital workers</a> in the study had experienced moderate to poor recovery periods, and related research cited by the team found that those who do not learn effective methods of recovering are at higher risk for exhaustion and cynicism after one year.</p><p>When trying to get as much done as possible, people often don’t allow themselves to have as much downtime as needed for optimal performance. Even after reading some of the advantages of having hobbies, you may feel <a href=\"https://productivitytheory.com/should-you-give-up-hobbies-for-better-productivity-at-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tempted to give up yours</a> due to the time management-related concerns mentioned earlier.</p><p>However, when you start sacrificing some non-work-related activities — such as hobbies — it becomes easier to justify other things you normally do in your downtime, like sleep.</p><p>Research carried out on mice found that slumber allowed the rodents to recalibrate neurons in their brains, helping to <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2017/02/02/sleep-brain-memories-mice-study/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reinforce the lessons learned</a> during time away. That research strengthened the belief that the minds of living things can only hold so much information before requiring rest.</p><p>If you take care to set aside time for relaxation through hobbies, it should be easier to get enough shut-eye, too. Together, both those activities could help you excel while getting things done.</p><p>Now that you’ve gotten an overview of why hobbies help keep you creative and productive, let’s look at several of the best options to try.</p><h2>7 Hobbies to Foster Productivity and Creativity</h2><h3>1. Walking</h3><p>Many people believe that the ultimate way to stay as productive as possible at work is to stay in one place — usually their desks — and devote attention solely to the task at hand. However, if you’re stuck in a creative rut, research indicates it’s useful to break up your workday with a hobby that makes you move, such as walking</p><p>Charles Dickens and Virginia Woolf are two famous authors who kept up a regular walking habit for creativity reasons. Also, research from Stanford University showed that when people received mental tasks that required creativity, walking while doing them <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/minding-the-body/201603/become-better-writer-be-frequent-walker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">led to more creativity</a> than sitting still.</p><p>Some people even take part in meditative walks and focus on things such as the wind blowing through their hair and the sound of their footsteps on the pavement. If you often feel it’s hard to remain productive due to the wild thoughts running through your head, meditating in that way could calm down the inner turmoil and make it easier for you to concentrate.</p><h3>2. Playing Video Games</h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-13607\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-3-768x512.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-3-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-3-640x427.jpeg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-3.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p><p>You might think that video games are low on the mental stimulation scale compared to some activities, but that’s not always the case. A comprehensive review of the effect of video games on children found that role-playing and strategy-based games <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/02/video-game.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improved problem-solving abilities</a>.</p><p>One potential downside of a video game-playing hobby is that you might find it too solitary. In that case, consider looking for video game groups in your area that involve participants playing at the same time as at least one other person. The combined knowledge you already have about the game and the suggestions from other gaming fans could make it easier to progress through levels and tackle challenges compared to playing by yourself.</p><p>Also, consider how much more effectively you could work by solving problems quicker than usual, due in part to video games. In addition to helping you overcome challenges, improved problem-solving abilities could cause you to not find yourself in as many tricky situations that compromise an ability to work at your best.</p><h3>3. Learning a New Language</h3><p>If you only speak one language, substantial amounts of evidence indicate that learning another during your downtime could promote more alertness, improved multitasking, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/benefits-of-learning-another-language-2017-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and other worthy benefits</a>. Also, it doesn’t necessarily take a long time to see those positive outcomes. In the case of the study that determined a link between language learning and alertness, those students were only enrolled in a one-week course.</p><p>To connect productivity with your language-learning goals, determine if there are things you typically do during a workday that could benefit from knowing another language. Do you live in an area that has a large Spanish-speaking population? Have representatives at your company recently signed a deal with a large company in France?</p><p>After learning a new language and becoming fluent, you could get more done by using your brain for language-related duties and being less reliant on Google Translate or a similar, potentially time-consuming service. If that outcome happens, you’d also be in a fantastic position to assert that you deserve a promotion.</p><h3>4. Stamp Collecting</h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-13613\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-5-768x512.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" /></p><p>Stamp collecting is a pastime with a rich history. First established as a hobby in the late 1800s, it reached a peak in the 1970s when there were <a href=\"https://www.apfelbauminc.com/library/stamp-collecting-not-dead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 1,000 prominent dealers</a> active in the United States. Even though it’s been around for generations, stamp collecting is a hobby that’s still worth pursuing.</p><p>Many people do so for investment reasons, knowing that some rare stamps can become extremely lucrative possessions. Regardless of if you’re in it for the money, collecting stamps can help you appreciate the creative motivations that went into producing specific limited-edition stamps. You could also engage with other stamp collectors in your state or city and meet with them for trading, sales, and discussions.</p><h3>5. Playing Chess</h3><p>Earlier, we explored the benefits of getting engrossed in video games as a hobby, but some other kinds of beneficial games aren’t as high tech. Chess is one of them, and research suggests it has <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/119332/how-chess-players-brains-are-different-from-everybody-else-s#.x6mfMeW4A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several brain-building characteristics</a>. For example, it teaches you to think in patterns and use previous memories to make decisions, which could increase productivity.</p><p>Scientific evidence also shows that chess players have smaller brains compared to non-chess players. Although that may seem like a negative factor, the associated research indicated the smaller size could be a sign of increased neural efficiency. Furthermore, the act of playing chess makes people use both sides of their brains, which stimulates more advanced thought processes.</p><h3>6. Scrapbooking</h3><p>When going on a trip or reaching a milestone in life, you probably like to have some mementos to help you recall the occasion. To keep all their memories in one place, many people create scrapbooks. You may find that’s a fun and fruitful hobby, especially if you take pride in finishing projects and showing them to others.</p><p>Scrapbooking also lets you practice being both creative and productive. Creativity comes into the equation when you decide how to arrange photographs, ticket stubs, and other materials while simultaneously choosing which color of paper to use, whether to decorate the page with cutout shapes and if you should describe a page’s contents with a handwritten caption.</p><p>Productivity is a factor because if you take too long to complete each page of the scrapbook, you’ll likely lose interest before finishing the endeavor. You might even find it useful to set up a scrapbooking schedule. It’ll keep you on track by providing things to get involved in each day and help you keep tabs on the extent of the work you’re doing, thereby increasing self-esteem.</p><h3>7. Team Sports</h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-13611\" src=\"http://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-6-768x511.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-6-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-6-500x332.jpeg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-6-640x426.jpeg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hobbies-6.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p><p>A study carried out on workers in the United Kingdom found that sports boosts morale and <a href=\"https://www.spacesworks.com/sports-boosts-productivity-levels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make work environments more productive</a>. Perhaps that’s because people who get involved in sports can see their efforts pay off when they practice their disciplines. Although you’ll undoubtedly see some benefits by picking a sport you play independently, consider doing something that makes you part of a team.</p><p>Taking that approach could enhance your communication skills, making it easier to get results while on the playing field as well as at work. While interacting with their teammates, athletes often use body language, gestures, and similar techniques to tell fellow players things without giving the other team valuable strategies.</p><p>Also, recall the earlier discussion of the positive effect of hobbies on patience and self-control. Playing a sport with your team tends to increase those qualities. For example, you’ll have to show patience while learning new skills.</p><p>Self-control is also necessary when you have the option to practice with your teammates or binge-watch a favorite TV show. The latter may feel more tempting if you lack energy, but coming together with your teammates to work toward a common goal increases your focus and willpower.</p><p>If people at your workplace are up for the idea, think about asking your supervisor if you could organize a sports team made up of your colleagues. Then, you’d not only reap the benefits of having a hobby, but you’d also learn more about the people at your job and make your social life more diverse.</p><p>At first, hobbies may seem like productivity disruptors, but now, thanks to these studies and examples, you know better. By rearranging your schedule to make room for hobbies, you’ll likely notice some of the benefits described above, as well as others you’d hadn’t considered.
