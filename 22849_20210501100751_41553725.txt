He’s also the son and grandson of entrepreneurs and an independent spirit, so it was pretty clear what career path he’d ultimately pursue. <a href=\"https://www.joinpapa.com/\">Papa</a> –which offers Family on Demand– was born from Andrew’s experience arranging a youthful pal for his own Papa, a fairly demanding guy, at least in Andrew’s telling. When Papa was pleased with the service, Andrew knew it would appeal more broadly.</p> \n<p>After being selected for Y Combinator and raising investment funds, it was off to the races. Papa Pals have been providing companionship and help with everyday tasks, combatting loneliness, sustaining independence, and making life more fun. The newly launched <a href=\"https://www.papa.health/\">Papa Health</a> adds Papa Docs to the mix, helping seniors navigate primary care, urgent care and manage their chronic conditions.</p> \n<p>In this episode of the HealthBiz podcast, Andrew and I discuss his early career in telehealth, the founding of Papa, and experiences during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Andrew didn’t grow up as a big reader, and he still prefers audio books to the printed word. His favorite book, <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/Meditations-Audiobook/B00V3YF9VC\"><em>Meditations</em></a> by Marcus Aurelius is a classic in the true sense of the word.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, If your business needs strategy consulting support please reach out to me at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:dwilliams@HealthBusinessGroup.com\">dwilliams@HealthBusinessGroup.com</a>.
