He had a reputation in entrepreneur circles as a taker. His Self Publishing School had an alarming number of negative reviews. Oh, and Victoria Strauss thought so poorly of him that she stopped sending authors to The Book Designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lately, however I have found a whole new reason to dislike him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is pirating my blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while in 2019 and 2020 I was a regular contributor to The Book Designer. Fourteen or my posts were published there before the blog was sold. Topics ranged from website security to the hacked accounts on Createspace to newsletters.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would probably still be contributing posts if Joel hadn’t sold the blog, but now that it belonged to Bolt I decided that I no longer wanted my content associated with his blemished reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I asked them to take my posts down. Three times now I have asked, and they are still hosting my blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have only received one response so far, and that was an email informing me that they bought the content along with the blog. This simply is not true; while my blog posts were indeed published on TBD, there was no agreement transferring the copyright. There was in fact no formal contract at all; the closest I had to a contract with Joel was an understanding that TBD had an exclusive on the new blog posts. I think that lasted a month, and then I could publish the blog posts elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That lack of a formal agreement is actually pretty common, so much so that when NAPCO bought Teleread in 2010, NAPCO sent contracts to all the contributing writers so that it could secure the right to continue to publish the blog posts the writers had previously submitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I admit, it was a mistake for me to rely on would be described in legal terms as a gentleman’s agreement, but TBH I had never conceived that someone might refuse to remove my blog posts when I asked. Actually, I never thought I would want to make that request!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might seem like an oversight but the truth is I am careful about where I send my guest blog posts. I only work with reputable blogs, and it never occurred to me that one of my partners might become unsavory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have learned my lesson, though. I will shortly be <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/02/17/ebook-piracy-how-to-respond-if-someone-steals-your-ebook-online/\">filing DMCA notices</a>, and in the future I will only send someone a guest blog post after they have agreed that I retain the copyright.</p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2021/04/11/chandler-bolt-is-pirating-my-blog-posts/\">Chandler Bolt is Pirating My Blog Posts</a> which was published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com\">The Digital Reader</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=GCGs1Rx_n0I:uLWKp1RvkJo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=GCGs1Rx_n0I:uLWKp1RvkJo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=GCGs1Rx_n0I:uLWKp1RvkJo:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/GCGs1Rx_n0I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 12:37:01 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chandler-bolt.jpg?resize=620%2C436&ssl=1","linkMd5":"58ee5dfbe1f7adcff30b4b0a4e881163","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn6@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-29-265_14e9562af22ed23e.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":436,"sourceBytes":22966,"destBytes":22966,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chandler-bolt.jpg?resize=620%2C436&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn6@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-29-265_14e9562af22ed23e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-06-561_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn32@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-06-394_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn37@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-06-274_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/GCGs1Rx_n0I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn35@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-06-243_fd94e8cea9310b93.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245799930},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:19","title":"Where to Buy Books in Bulk","link":"https://the-digital-reader.com/?p=143116","description":"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/P1050739.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-143117\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/P1050739.jpg?resize=620%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/P1050739.jpg?resize=620%2C300&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/P1050739.jpg?zoom=2&#38;resize=620%2C300&#38;ssl=1 1240w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/P1050739.jpg?zoom=3&#38;resize=620%2C300&#38;ssl=1 1860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recently developed a need for buying children’s books in bulk. I found a couple sources, one great and the other not so great, and I want to share them with you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know if I have mentioned it here, but some time back (I think it was pre-pandemic, but honestly who knows at this point) I started taking care of the two </span><a href=\"https://littlefreelibrary.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little Free Libraries</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in my area. I would keep them organized, remove any damaged or age-inappropriate books (both were located next to elementary schools), and leave bookmarks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started doing this because I had noticed that no one else seemed to be doing the job, but I stopped last fall when the school district started holding in-person classes again. I honestly thought that someone one at the schools would step up, but when I checked in on the LFLs a week ago I found that both were sorely depleted, and that no one had bothered to even straighten the books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was happy to start taking care of the LFLs again, but it also meant that I had a sudden and exceptional need for kids books. I </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/inkbitspixels/status/1378128115273236485\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">asked for help on Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and got a variety of useful suggestions ranging from thrift shops, the free section of Craigslist, garage sales, flea markets, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea I settled on was to google for online booksellers who would ship me a box of books, cheap. I found two that I wanted to try (the next time I need books, I might try others).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One was </span><a href=\"https://www.thebookbundler.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bundler</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the other was </span><a href=\"https://www.booksbythefoot.com/shop/pc/Boxed-Children-s-Books-20p148.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Books by the Foot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Of the two, I really have to say that BbtF was the much better deal. Not only were the books half as expensive, but my order arrived on the Tuesday after I placed an order Friday night. (It probably helped that the order shipped from Maryland.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The order from The Book Bundler, on the other hand, arrived on Friday. That was still pretty fast, but I never did get an order confirmation email from TBB (a huge strike against them, IMO &#8211; I need that email for my records).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bundler sent me 10 bundles of ten hardback children’s books in two boxes each somewhat larger than a box of copier paper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Books by the Foot sent me one box of books that size (12” by 12” by 18”, to be exact). I opted for the non-age-specific box, so I got everything from books for 5th graders to board books. The books were all in good shape, but the box almost didn’t survive the trip. (Fedex had to add several extra loops of tape to keep the box from disintegrating, and it still split a seam.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still think BbtF was the better value; that box set me back $45, while TBB charged me $155.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mother (a former teacher) thought that the selection in the BbtF box was so great that she wanted me to have a box shipped to my nephew. I would have done so, except BbtF would not ship to Pennsylvania (no clue why).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need to buy kids books in bulk, I heartily recommend Books by the Foot. Their website is not as well organized as it could be, but if you scroll down to the bottom of their </span><a href=\"https://www.booksbythefoot.com/shop/pc/viewAllPrds.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“view all products” page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you will see they have a couple dozen different options for grab-bag boxes of books ranging from genre paperback to various age-specific kids books.</span></p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2021/04/10/where-to-buy-books-in-bulk/\">Where to Buy
