The source of the phrase is chess, where queens are the most powerful piece, as tenure-track faculty are, in theory, the most powerful members of an academic community.  In the game giving up the queen is a desperate move, often an attempt to wrest victory from a very bad situation, and so it seems to be for colleges and universities axing people in those positions.  You can find many examples of this academic strategy being used <a href=\"https://bryanalexander.org/tag/queensacrifice/\">here</a>, alas.)</p>\n<p>On the chopping <a href=\"http://mastmedia.plu.edu/2021/fjc-process-board-of-regents-announces-faculty-and-academic-cuts/\">block</a> for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Lutheran_University\">Pacific Lutheran University</a> are 36 positions.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlobalHigherEd/status/1381948747064705025\">Kris Olds observes</a> that &#8220;[t]hat’s about 12% of the faculty base.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That’s about 12% of the faculty base <a href=\"https://t.co/rEaWQL35yx\">https://t.co/rEaWQL35yx</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Kris Olds (@GlobalHigherEd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlobalHigherEd/status/1381948747064705025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Academic programs being cut include &#8220;majors in German and Nordic Studies, minors in Classical Studies, German and Norwegian, and the Master of Science in Finance degree.&#8221;  According to <a href=\"http://mastmedia.plu.edu/2021/fjc-process-board-of-regents-announces-faculty-and-academic-cuts/\">this statement</a>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>the Division of Humanities saw the most cuts, followed by the Division of Social Sciences, the School of Arts and Communication and the Division of Natural Sciences.
