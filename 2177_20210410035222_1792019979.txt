February’s projects were super hard to pick since there are so many amazing releases. These are exciting new releases from some of the coolest projects around. There’s everything from world-changing tech to weekend hobbies. There are a lot of first version releases in March, so get excited to be wowed by new products. There are so many releases, and unfortunately we can’t feature them all. Grab your leftover Easter eggs, put the coffee on, and read our top staff picks for this month.</p> \n<h2 id=\"vs-code-1-54\">VS Code 1.54<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57222#vs-code-1-54\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"VS Code 1.54\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>We know it’s not a major x.0 release, but this release of VS Code is massive. Many people forget <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VS Code</a> is open source. Anyone can check out the VS Code roadmap, plans, and contribute to the project. With this big release, VS Code is available for Apple Silicon. There’s also better word navigation on Windows, personalised icon themes, improved timeline views, more keyboard shortcuts, and remote ports table view. There’s more to this release, so make sure you read all the juicy features on the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_54\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VS Code blog</a>. And yes, it’s called the February Release that’s released at the start of March. Kind of like how we call this the March Release Radar, but we publish it in April for all the projects released in March. Hopefully that’s not too confusing to everyone’s chocolate-loaded brains.</p> \n<div style=\"width: 2722px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_54/macOS-universal-download.png?resize=2712%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Website showing the default download for macOS\" width=\"2712\" height=\"1280\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />\n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">VS Code is now available on macOS.</p>\n</div> \n<h2 id=\"rust-1-51\">Rust 1.51<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57222#rust-1-51\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Rust 1.51\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Yes, another not-so-major-x.0-release, but a worthy one to mention. <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rust</a> is the programming language developers use to build reliable and efficient software. Lots of big companies use it, from Dropbox to Firefox. This new version of Rust comes with by-value array iteration, new cargo resolver, and new stabilised APIs. The 1.51 release is one of the biggest editions to the Rust language and Cargo. Aside from these new features, there’s also better compile times on macOS as well as better debugging information.

Developers can easily build e-commerce sites, landing pages, blogs, and more. Gatsby’s latest release is even faster. With optimised loading, responsive images, accessible routing, and webpack configuration, Gatsby 3.0 is the fastest you can get. The new release claims to be 80% faster. A faster build means a faster deploy. There are fewer bugs, and dependencies are updated as quickly as possible. Now you have more time for the things that really matter<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span> eating all those Easter eggs! Or you can spend the extra time reading up on all the fast new <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/gatsby-v3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">changes to Gatsby 3.0.</a></p> \n<h2 id=\"crystal-1-0\">Crystal 1.0<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57222#crystal-1-0\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Crystal 1.0\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>I like crystals. They are shiny and pretty. This <a href=\"https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crystal</a> in particular is a programming language.
