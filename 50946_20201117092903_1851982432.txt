We're all aware that eCommerce stores have the potential to bring in a passive income, with no physical leases, open 24/7, and other added benefits. </p>\n\n<p>But what you don't know is that simply having an eCommerce store alone doesn't ensure success. The <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675438046/conversion-rate-optimization-tools\">conversion rate</a> from being visitors to a customer is slim. On average, only <a href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/the-average-website-conversion-rate-by-industry/\">2.86%</a> of eCommerce website visits convert into a purchase. That's a pretty low percentage, but it's more common than you actually think if you look closer. </p>\n\n<p>Customers have endless eCommerce choices. They can browse, compare purchases, and head to your competitors without even thinking twice. So how do you improve sales in a world so unforgiving as eCommerce? </p>\n\n<p>Start with the basics and then work your way up. First, ensure that your eCommerce store follows the best eCommerce website practices and then create an <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675437745/ecommerce-growth-strategy\">eCommerce marketing strategy</a> to follow. </p>\n\n<p>Today we'll help you with the first task on the list. Here are 16 proven eCommerce website best practices to improve sales for your business. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4 id=\"1improveyourecommercestoreloadingtime\">1. Improve Your eCommerce Store Loading Time</h4>\n\n<p>The time it takes for your eCommerce store loads can affect your eCommerce sales. In a study done by <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/\">Akamai</a>, about half of web users expect a site to load in two seconds or less. Not to mention around <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/#:~:text=Facts%20and%20Stats%20to%20Tweet,was%20too%20slow%20to%20load.&#38;text=40%25%20of%20people%20abandon%20a,a%207%25%20reduction%20in%20conversions\">40%</a> of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load. </p>\n\n<p>From the moment your customer clicks your eCommerce store's URL to the minute it loads determines if they'll stay or leave. Here is a list of things that can affect your website loading time and how to fix them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Uncompress images and optimize files:</strong> Images currently take up 60% of the average bytes loaded per page, around 1504KB. It's important to note that you should use high-quality images to show off your brand; however, high-quality images are usually the main culprit for slow eCommerce stores. To avoid this, try to compress or optimize your photos with tools like <a href=\"https://tinyjpg.com/\">Tinyjpg</a> or website plugins, so your pictures down cause your website to lag. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Minimize code requests:</strong>  Your theme or code can sometimes slow your website. You may need a developer, but you can start compressing it to the smallest size without affecting its operation with their help. Google recommends a few different tools to help you do this:\nTo minify HTML, try <a href=\"https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier\">HTMLMinifier</a>. <br>\nTo minify CSS, try <a href=\"https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano\">CSSNano</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/css/csso\">csso</a>. <br>\nTo minify JavaScript, try <a href=\"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS\">UglifyJS</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Optimize Your Plugins:</strong> Those apps you've been adding to your website to keep everything together might be slowing down your site. Pay attention to the number of plugins you add to your site. Too many, and it may be time for you to find a plugin that can do the job of three. Not only is this cost-effective, but your site has fewer plugins to sync with regularly. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"2ensureyourwebsiteiseasytouse\">2. Ensure Your Website is Easy to Use</h4>\n\n<p>Seamless navigation on your website is the act of allowing visitors to move point A-B or find information without confusion or hindrance. Making your <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675438054/ecommerce-marketing-tips\">website easy to use</a>, shop, and browse keeps customers on your eCommerce site long enough to make a purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever gone on a site and had to click through hoops for just one product?</p>\n\n<p>That can be frustrating for anyone.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Harry-eCommerce-site-video-1.gif\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p>To ensure that your eCommerce website is easy to use, you should have the following: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Simplify Your Website Tabs:</strong> Try to avoid having too many tabs. If you do, create sub-tabs and organize your categories accordingly. This gives the impression that you're organized, and you want customers to find what they're looking for with ease. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Make Use of Your Footer:</strong> For more detailed information like shipping rates, privacy policies, contact and FAQ's, link them in the footer instead of the header. This keeps your header free from clutter.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Test Your Layout:</strong> Take time to test your website layout. Use heatmaps and website analytic tools to see how users navigate on your site in real-time and make adjustments. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"3abtestyourecommercewebsiteregularly\">3. A/B Test Your eCommerce Website Regularly</h4>\n\n<p>Earlier, we spoke about testing your layout. If you realize that eCommerce store visitors aren't completing checkout, then it's time to consider A/B Testing your pages and checkout to see what's working and what's not. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/AB-Testing.png\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p>By A/B testing your eCommerce store, you can work with personalized data on which features and layouts work best for your eCommerce brand. You can often achieve huge improvements in conversions by simplifying or re-arranging the copy, tabs, and features on your website: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate\">31% of shoppers</a> say they abandon purchases if they're forced to create an account</li>\n<li>23% of shoppers abandon purchases due to a complicated checkout process</li>\n<li>One test found that shorter forms <a href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/lead-generation/lead-generation-testing-form-field-length-reduces-cost-per-lead-by-10-66\">increased conversions by 34%</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is a list of the best A/B Testing tools you'll need to ensure that you get the most out of your testing experience: </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"hotjarwwwhotjarcom\"><a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675438115/ecommerce-website-best-practices/www.hotjar.com\">HotJar</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/HotJar.png\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"luckyorangehttpswwwluckyorangecom\"><a href=\"https://www.luckyorange.com/\">Lucky Orange</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/lucky-orange.jpg\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"abtastyhttpswwwabtastycom\"><a href=\"https://www.abtasty.com/\">AB Tasty</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/AB-TASTY.png\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"convertizehttpswwwconvertizecom\"><a href=\"https://www.convertize.com/\">Convertize</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/convertize.png\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"4integratewithmarketingleadgeneratingapps\">4.

Give Customers Multiple Delivery Options</h4>\n\n<p>One of the top reasons people don't follow through with purchases on your eCommerce website is that your delivery options and shipping cost aren't appealing. You may have high shipping rates or limited delivery options. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, give shoppers multiple options for delivery. Allow them to have in-store pick-up, express, or overnight delivery options. That's why it's so important to map out a defined shipping strategy on hand. </p>\n\n<p>If you're not sure what to do or improve your delivery method, here are <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/ecommerce-shipping-options/\">8 shipping options to consider for your store</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Wayfair.png\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p>Don't forget to grab your <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675438115/ecommerce-website-best-practices/#wp_popup_2553066\" type=\"popup\">FREE eCommerce Checklist</a> so you can use it to ensure that your online store is ready to attract and generate sales. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"8createecommerceemailcampaignstopushsales\">8. Create eCommerce Email Campaigns to Push Sales</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675437638/ecommerce-email-marketing\">Email marketing</a> is still one of the most powerful lead generating tools for an eCommerce store. Your store should be equipped with it so you can push sales with new and current customers. Here are three must-have eCommerce email campaigns you should have: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Welcome Email Campaign:</strong> The average open rate for a welcome email is 50%. That makes it 86% more effective than standard newsletters. So don't skip your welcome email campaign. This is also an excellent opportunity to show off your best sellers, brand story, show off your social proof/UGC, and more.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/welcome-email.jpg\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Order Email Campaign:</strong> Have an automated order email campaign to inform customers once they've made their order when it's shipped and delivered. Order emails help to give customers confidence in your brand and inform them from start to finish. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/everlane-email-order.png\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Shopping Cart Abandonment Campaign:</strong>  Nearly 40% of surveyed consumers responded that they abandoned their shopping cart because they had been just browsing in the first place. When you send shopping cart abandonment email campaigns, you give visitors a reason to go back to your store and complete a purchase. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Abandoned-Cart-Emails.png\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wishpond.com/courses/wishpond-email-marketing-masterclass-for-beginners?utm_source=blog&#38;utm_medium=blog\"><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Wishpond-Email-Sign-Up-Link.png\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></a></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"9tapintothepowerofinfluencermarketing\">9.

Optimize Your Shopping Cart Page</h4>\n\n<p>Optimizing your shopping cart page can help to reduce shopping cart abandonment. This is the act of a shopper filling up their cart and then leaving without making a purchase. Since the shopping cart page is the last step to grab the customer, you want to ensure that it's optimized to keep them on that page until they click \"pay now.\" </p>\n\n<p>Start by showing customers an inventory of their order with the total cost, including shipping and taxes. This will help to avoid surprise costs that can turn customers away. To do this, you'll have to ensure that your shopping cart page is laid out effectively and clearly for shoppers to see all the details they need. </p>\n\n<p>Another option would be to add guest checkout to your shopping cart page so customers can get in and out without the hassle of creating a profile. <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/guest-checkout-right-for-store\">Guest checkout</a> refers to the ability for shoppers to make a purchase from your store without logging in to an account or saving any information in your database (such as username, password, shipping/billing address, etc.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/nordstrom-guest-checkout.jpg\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p>Now there are pro's and con's to adding guest checkout to your eCommerce guide, so for more, check out WooCommerce's guide on <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/guest-checkout-right-for-store/#:~:text=Guest%20checkout%20refers%20to%20the,billing%20address%2C%20etc.\">Determining if Guest Checkout is Right For Your Store.</a>.)</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"16useyourecommerceblogtocaptureleads\">16. Use Your eCommerce Blog to Capture Leads</h4>\n\n<p>Use your eCommerce blog to show off your new products. Show visitors what's to come before or on your launch day, show them in detail why your new product deserves to be in their cart. </p>\n\n<p>Even if a customer sees your eCommerce blog post days or months after it can still help to push sales your way, another option, you can also ask an influencer to publish a blog post about your product. Making it a win-win on both ends. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/au-lit-fine-linens.jpg\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p>When Au Lit Fine Linens launched their new linen collection, they posted an eCommerce blog post showing off the collection in detail, along with the inspiration for the collection itself.  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/aulitfinelinens.jpg\" alt=\"16 eCommerce Website Best Practices to Improve Your Sales\"></p>\n\n<p>To start mastering your blog, start using these <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675438073/ecommerce-blog\">8 Tested Ways to Use Your eCommerce Blog to Capture Leads</a></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"summary\">Summary</h4>\n\n<p>Making changes to your eCommerce store is a constant factor if you plan to improve your sales and increase website traffic.
