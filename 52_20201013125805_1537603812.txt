Digital Camera Modes Explained</a> &#8211; I spoke with a family friend recently who had just bought a new point and shoot camera. She came up to me with her camera when no one was watching and embarrassedly asked me if I could tell her what all the little icons on the dial on top of her camera meant. This article explains what each of the most common digital camera modes means and does. Knowing these photography modes can take your shots to the next level.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2. Aperture and Shutter Priority Modes</a> &#8211; This introduction takes you through these two very useful settings that can be found on many digital cameras. Aperture and Shutter Priority mode take you off of Auto mode, giving you more control over your images without thrusting you fully into Manual mode. They are great settings to explore and master.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3. Introduction to White Balance</a> &#8211; One of the most common problems that I see in beginner photography is shots with incorrect colors. We&#8217;ve all seen them: portraits where your subject&#8217;s teeth and eyeballs (and everything else) have a yellowish tinge. Learn what causes this and how to combat it with this tutorial on white balance.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/histogram.jpg?resize=150%2C106&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Photography settings, techniques, and rules histogram\" width=\"150\" height=\"106\" hspace=\"10\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /> <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-histograms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4. Understanding Histograms</a> &#8211; &#8220;Histograms are scary.&#8221; This is what one reader said to me recently when they discovered that they could view these little graphs on their camera. While histograms might seem a little technical, it is amazing how simple a histogram is to interpret. Know what to look for, and with just a glance you can tell if your image is under- or over-exposed. It&#8217;s a useful tool to master.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/automatic-exposure-bracketing-aeb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5. Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB)</a> &#8211; This feature is another of those often-unexplored settings that many cameras have built into them.
