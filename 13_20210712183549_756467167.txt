We have no connection with Weber Grill. This is just a heartfelt article from a middle-aged dude waxing nostalgic about childhood summer cookouts where a Weber Kettle Grill took center stage. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s summertime, and that means cookouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to BBQ-ing around here, I’ve been using a gas grill during the 10 years I’ve lived in my house. It’s super convenient. Just turn the knob and light the grill. Bam. Fire. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/summer-grilling-week-the-3-zone-fire-video/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a three-zone fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on my gas grill is incredibly easy. A few twists of the knobs, and I can have a high-heat zone, medium-heat zone, and low-heat zone at the ready. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, while I love the convenience of cooking with a gas grill, it does lack a certain charm that I associated with outdoor cooking growing up. Like a lot of American kids, my family had a charcoal-fueled Weber Kettle Grill in the backyard. With its black, porcelain-enameled lid and bowl, this iconic, spherical cooking device was a fixture of my suburban childhood. And getting that baby lit and going was like an ancestral ritual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To my childhood mind, firing up a Weber charcoal grill had existential significance. It felt like an important, manly task because in my home, like I’m sure in many homes across America, my dad was in charge of it. It all started about an hour before eating time. First, Pops would wheel the grill out to the grass. Then he’d empty out the old ashes into a brown paper sack and hand me the cooking grate to go clean in the laundry room. When I got back, he’d pour a big pile of charcoal into the Weber’s shiny black bowl. Kingsford brand, natch. Then came a spray with some lighter fluid, and the strike and toss of a match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WHOOSH!!!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After enjoying the sound of a newly birthed charcoal fire, we’d stand around the grill and watch the flame slowly get smaller and smaller, and the charcoal get whiter and whiter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a certain moment, Dad would decide that the charcoal was ready for cooking. On would go the grate, and an assortment of burger patties, hot dogs, and sausages were laid upon this culinary altar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the victuals were hot and sizzling, they were eagerly placed inside soft Wonder Bread buns, slathered with ketchup and all the other fixins, and devoured with gusto. Each bite tasted of the charcoal-imparted flavor of smoke. Each bite tasted of summer. At least that’s how I remember it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other day as I was cooking burgers in a far more antiseptic fashion on my gas grill, I started waxing nostalgic about these Weber Grill-related memories of mine. I decided I wanted to try cooking on one myself, to see if it was as good as I recalled. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Use a Weber Kettle Grill</span></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137418\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/weber.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/weber.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/weber-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get reacquainted with the Weber Kettle Grill as a grown man, I first went down to my local Home Depot and bought the classic model for myself. The grill set me back $120. Not bad for something that can provide years of use. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, I called my friend and resident AoM meat-cooking consultant, Karl Engel, and asked him to show me the ropes on how to cook with it. Here’s what he taught me.</span></p>\n<h3>Load Your Charcoal (You Don’t Need as Much as You Think)</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137419\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/pouring.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/pouring.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/pouring-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pick your charcoal of choice. You can’t go wrong with the standard Kingsford briquettes. Karl doesn’t like to use the Match Light variety, in which the briquettes are already coated in lighter fluid; he doesn’t think they burn as well, and he likes to control how much lighter fluid he puts on his charcoal, when he uses it (which is in cases where he doesn’t have a charcoal starter). </span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137421\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/charcoal_in_kettle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/charcoal_in_kettle.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/charcoal_in_kettle-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing Karl pointed out that dads in the 1970s and 80s got wrong about cooking with charcoal is that they used too much. As he told me: “My father would just pour half the bag into the kettle and create a ginormous pile. Every other dad I knew growing up did the same thing. I bet your dad did the same thing, too.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He did indeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t need that much charcoal when you grill,” Karl went on to explain. “Less than you think you need. Maybe 1/4 of the bag.”</span></p>\n<p>Note: Before you load new charcoal into the kettle, you’ll want to empty the ashes from the previous grilling session. It’s easy to do: just move the handle that opens and shuts the bottom vents back and forth and the ashes will fall into the the ash catcher below (the pie pan looking thing). Lift up the ash catcher and dump the ashes in a paper bag. Done.</p>\n<h3>Light Your Charcoal</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karl’s a fan of charcoal starters. </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-light-a-charcoal-grill/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to read our article on how to use them</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137422\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/gel_firestarter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/gel_firestarter.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/gel_firestarter-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We didn’t have a charcoal starter on hand this time around, so we used some firestarter gel from Hasty-Bake. It’s great stuff. It doesn’t evaporate quickly like traditional lighter fluid and doesn’t give your meat that gross lighter fluid taste. </span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137423\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/light_it_up.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/light_it_up.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/light_it_up-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he’s firing up his charcoal, Karl likes to shove all of it to one side of the kettle. It makes it easier to light. You can spread the briquettes out across the bottom once they’ve transformed into hot coals. </span></p>\n<h3>Make Sure Your Bottom Vents Are Open</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137424\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/vents.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/vents.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/vents-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vents in the grill’s bowl and lid allow you to control the airflow into your grill. The more air, the hotter your fire will be. For grilling, you want a hot fire, so you want plenty of air to come in. Open those bottom vents up.</span></p>\n<h3>Wait Until the Charcoal Is Gray/White Before You Start Cooking</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137425\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/fire.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/fire.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/fire-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes about 30 minutes for the briquettes to turn gray/white, which signals that they’re ready to cook your food.

If I were grilling steaks, I might use the lid to get some oven-like cooking while I’m grilling the meat. In that case, I’d put the lid on and open up its vents,” Karl told me. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Outcome</span></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137429\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/meat4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/meat4.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/meat4-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So did cooking with a Weber Kettle Grill in 2021 match up with my memories of what it was like in 1988? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that I noticed while putting the grill together was that the materials just seemed chintzier and more flimsy than those on the Weber Kettle Grill my dad owned. (Weber grills are still assembled in America, but with some imported components.) The metal in the legs seems to bend pretty easily. The most significant difference that stood out to me was that all the handles on the new models have plastic instead of wood. The wood on the 1970s and 80s versions really classed things up. Oh well. That’s “progress” for ya. </span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137433\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/finished.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/finished.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/finished-320x215.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than that, everything else was the same. The sound of the fire whooshing. The smell of smoldering charcoal and caramelizing meat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I gotta say, charcoal definitely makes your burgers taste better than gas. Love that smokey flavor. Our kids rated their charcoal-cooked burgers an enthusiastic 10/10. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooking with a Weber Kettle Grill certainly takes more time and attention than using a gas grill. But as with all things in life, that effort transforms the task into more of an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experience</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I’ll continue to use my gas grill for weeknight dinners, but turn to the Weber when hosting things that I want to feel more like an event. In doing so, hopefully my kids will absorb the same Dad-imbued, charcoal-infused summertime impressions that waft through one’s memory for a lifetime.</span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/revisiting-the-classic-weber-kettle-grill/\">Revisiting the Classic Weber Kettle Grill</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/qW06UN9ZmrU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 15:22:55 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"cc383011d2ffd105b529d604e3fce943","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/weber_grill_header4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-31-149_160154dbf51c3ea8.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/weber.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn60@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-31-176_df3fbedfab214b8b.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/pouring.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-31-663_7c8fe8ce2f44152b.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/charcoal_in_kettle.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn30@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-31-153_edd84660cf5a7f55.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/gel_firestarter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn48@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-31-237_ab513a0b610e8040.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/light_it_up.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn23@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-31-214_691e924f34aad221.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/vents.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-31-258_e3096307dd0b6a9c.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/fire.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-31-290_e51d6b4c2744aab1.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/gray.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn33@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-31-263_87a747203af28d1e.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/spread.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn39@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-31-148_59646c3a90e6df3e.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/meat.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn14@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-39-641_cc593bba2ec57182.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/meat4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn72@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-31-542_53816da4db398657.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/finished.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn51@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-31-156_84be8e85899773f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/qW06UN9ZmrU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn56@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-31-225_032b167c0ada9968.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916061},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"Podcast #720: The Secrets to Making the Perfect Burger","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=137449","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Secrets to Making the Perfect Burger\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/the-secrets-to-making-the-perfect-burger/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://kronnerburger.com/p6t9i3bo4d1d688fui2q68rzp61o3u\">Chris Kronner</a> took his first head chef position at an upscale restaurant, he inherited a menu which featured a popular burger.

We also get into our mutually conflicted feelings about pairing one’s burger with French fries, and, if you need to get your burger fix on the run, what fast food chain Chris thinks has the best burgers. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Why are Americans so attached to the hamburger?</li>\n<li>Chris’s go-to meat from the meat counter </li>\n<li>How should you grill your burger?</li>\n<li>Why does Chris use dry-aged beef in his burgers?</li>\n<li>Where do people go wrong with patty shape and size?</li>\n<li>The only seasoning you need when grilling </li>\n<li>Chris’s cheese of choice + other toppings </li>\n<li>The condiment that shouldn’t go on a burger </li>\n<li>What about side dishes? </li>\n<li>What’s the best fast food burger? </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/a-guide-to-dry-aged-beef/\">A Guide to Dry-Aged Beef</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-352-famous-butcher-dishes-things-meat/\">A Famous Butcher Dishes on All Things Meat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-best-order-to-stack-your-burger-toppings/\">The Best Order to Stack Your Burger Toppings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/ernest-hemingways-favorite-hamburger/\">How to Make Ernest Hemingway’s Favorite Burger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-grill-the-perfect-burger/\">How to Grill the Perfect Burger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-the-perfect-diner-style-smash-burger/\">How to Make the Perfect Diner-Style Smash Burger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-best-way-to-hold-a-burger-according-to-science/\">The Best Way to Hold a Burger — According to Science!</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://maydayseafood.com/\">MAYDAY Seafood</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-best-ways-to-reheat-and-reuse-leftover-french-fries/\">The Best Ways to Reheat and Reuse Leftover French Fries</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137451\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/kronner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"399\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/kronner.jpg 399w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/06/kronner-320x441.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Chris </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://kronnerburger.com/p6t9i3bo4d1d688fui2q68rzp61o3u\">Chris’s website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/kronnerburger\">Chris on Instagram</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

This article was originally published in July 2013. </em></p>\n<p>We often think that plane crashes are catastrophic and unsurvivable events. Thanks to movies and 24/7 news channels, the enduring image of a plane crash usually involves an aircraft plummeting to the ground from 30,000 feet and obliterating everyone on board in a terrifying fireball.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, that isn’t the case.<strong> In a report analyzing airline accidents from 1983 to 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board found that the survival rate of crashes was 95.7%.</strong> Sure, there are some accidents where everyone, or nearly everyone, died, but those are much rarer than you’d guess based on what you see in the news. The NTSB found that even in serious accidents where fire and substantial damage occurred, 76.6% of passengers still survived.</p>\n<p>Combine those stats with the relative rarity of airplane accidents even happening in the first place (the average American’s chances of being killed in an airplane crash are <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/how-risky-is-flying/\">about 1 in 11 million</a>), and you can see that flying is actually the safest form of transportation there is. Taking to the road on an average day is far more dangerous — it just doesn’t feel like it because you have four (or two) wheels on the ground and a sense of control.</p>\n<p>But it’s important to take note of another interesting tidbit that the FAA and NTSB found in their research on plane crashes: <strong>40% of fatalities that did occur happened in crashes that were survivable.</strong> Close to half of all airplane crash fatalities might have been prevented had passengers taken proper action.</p>\n<p>While the odds of being involved in a plane crash may be slim, they’re not zero. If it happened to you, would you know what to do to increase your chances of walking away? In today’s article we’re going to offer research-backed advice from Ben Sherwood’s <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QDLIWY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B001QDLIWY&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Survivor’s Club</a> </em>on what you can do to make it out of a plane crash alive.</p>\n<h2><strong>You’ve Only Got 90 Seconds to Get Out</strong></h2>\n<p>Understanding this is the key ingredient to surviving, and will frame all the other tips in this article. If you’ve survived the crash landing, you have a pretty good chance of getting out of the airplane alive. But, you only have 90 seconds to do so.</p>\n<p>You see, the thing that kills most passengers in a plane crash isn’t the actual impact, it’s the fire that typically engulfs the plane afterwards. Folks may be surprised they survived the impact, and become complacent about other dangers. People vastly underestimate how quickly a fire can spread and consume an airplane. Surveys show that most people think they actually have about 30 minutes to get out of a burning plane. The reality is that it takes, on average, <strong>just 90 seconds</strong> for a fire to burn through the plane’s aluminum fuselage and consume everything and everyone in it. If that sounds scary, it should; you need to be motivated to get your rear end out of the plane!</p>\n<h2><strong>Be Fit</strong></h2>\n<p>The FAA has rigorously studied and crunched the numbers on airplane crash survivors, as well as tested nearly 2,500 people in simulated evacuations to find out the type of person who typically survives. Their results?</p>\n<p><strong>Young, slender men have the best odds of surviving a plane crash. </strong>(Old, fat women have the worst odds — sorry Aunt Myrtle.)<strong><br></br></strong></p>\n<p>The FAA has found that differences in age, gender, and girth account for 31% of the difference between people’s evacuation times. Escaping a plane crash requires you to maneuver quickly through narrow aisles with luggage and wreckage strewn about. You may even have to throw blockages out of your way. You then have to slip through an emergency exit that may only be twenty inches wide. Kind of hard to do if you’re fat and out of shape.</p>\n<p>Not only can being out of shape reduce your chances of survival, it could also put other people’s lives at risk because they have to wait for you to exit safely. Hold-ups at the exit due to passengers having trouble deplaning has caused many unnecessary deaths. In a runway collision that occurred in 1991, investigators found the charred remains of 10 passengers lined up in the aisle waiting to leave the wing exit; folks who froze up and had trouble squeezing through the exit had created a fatal bottleneck.</p>\n<p>If you’re on the rotund side, make it a goal to shed some of that table muscle so <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/every-man-should-be-able-to-save-his-own-life-5-fitness-benchmarks-a-man-must-master/\">you’ll be fit enough to save your own life</a> and perhaps the lives of others (and not just on a plane, either, but in all kinds of survival situations). <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/\">We’ve got plenty of workouts on our site to choose from to get started</a>. </p>\n<h2><strong>Fly in Bigger Planes if Possible</strong></h2>\n<p>If you have the choice between flying in a puddle jumper or a 737, choose the 737. According to FAA investigations, larger planes have more energy absorption in a crash which means you’re subjected to less deadly force, and that may equate to a better survival rate. Consider flying on Southwest — whose fleet consists solely of 737s — and avoid regional carriers when possible; not only are their planes smaller, they have an <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-safe-is-your-airline\">accidents and incidents rate double that of national carriers</a> and their pilots are often less experienced and overworked. Note that national airlines frequently use a regional carrier for some of the routes that fly under their name.</p>\n<h3><strong>Remember the Five Row Rule</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/Five-Row-Rule-21.jpg\" alt=\"Five row rule survive plane crash diagram illustration.\" width=\"508\" height=\"288\"></img></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A few years ago, <em>Popular Mechanics</em> put out an <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/a1918/4219452/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> that analyzed every commercial plane crash in the U.S. and where survivors were sitting in each accident. The article’s author concluded that in the event of a crash, the safest place to be sitting was in the back of the plane. While they made a compelling case in that piece, <em>Popular Mechanics’ </em>conclusion isn’t well supported by expert research.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to the folks who dedicate their lives to studying plane crashes, the statistics are inconclusive because every plane crash is different. Sure, many crashes are nose-first, thus making the back of the plane safer, but there are some that have happened tail-first or wing-first. You just don’t know what kind of crash you’ll be in. Instead of worrying about whether your seat is near the back, focus on finding a seat near an exit. According to researcher Ed Galea, those who survive a plane crash typically <strong>only have to move an average of five rows to escape. </strong>Beyond five rows, the chance of getting out alive decreases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The best seat to have is in the exit row as you’d be the first one out should you need to exit. If you can’t snag that seat, go for the aisle. Not only do you have easier access to the lavatory during flight, you also have a 64% chance of survival compared to the 58% chance you’d have sitting in a window seat. Also avoid bulkhead rows. Sure, you have more leg room, but the walls don’t “give” as much as seats do when you collide with them in a crash.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Galea admits that there are exceptions to the Five Row Rule; he’s found people that successfully moved 19 rows to get to an exit. Moreover, even if you’re just two rows away from an exit, there’s always the chance that the exit door will be blocked or jammed. Overall, though, your chances of survival will increase if you’re within five rows of an exit.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overcome the Normalcy Bias With an Action Plan</strong></h2>\n<p>As we discussed in detail in our post on <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/are-you-a-sheep-or-sheepdog-part-ii-8-reasons-youre-hardwired-for-sheepness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">why we’re hardwired for sheepdom</a>, we’re all naturally affected by the Normalcy Bias. The Normalcy Bias causes our brains to assume that things will be predictable and normal all the time. When things aren’t normal, it takes our brain a long time to process this. Instead of springing to action when something unexpected happens, our brain kind of shrugs and figures that what is going on can’t be so bad, because truly bad events are so out of the ordinary.</p>\n<p>Investigators have discovered that normalcy bias has caused many unnecessary deaths in plane crashes. Instead of taking immediate action after a crash, people sort of mill around. Many will even start looking for their carry-on luggage before getting to the exit.</p>\n<p>Normalcy bias manifested itself in dramatic fashion during a plane collision in 1977 that killed 583 people — the worst aircraft disaster in history. Two 747 jumbo jets collided with each other just above the runway on the small island of Tenerife (part of the Canary Islands off of Morocco). After the collision, one jet tumbled to the ground and exploded, killing all 248 passengers on board.</p>\n<p>The other jet crash-landed, but didn’t explode. The collision sheared away the top of the jet and flames began to take over the aircraft. Passengers who survived the initial collision could have escaped unharmed, but they had to act fast. Paul Heck, a passenger on the burning plane (who was 65, by the way), sprung to action. He unbuckled his seatbelt, grabbed his wife’s hand, and hightailed it to the nearest exit. They, along with 68 other passengers, survived, while 328 died.</p>\n<p>In an interview after the disaster, Mr. Heck noted how most people just sat in their seats acting like everything was fine even after colliding with another plane and seeing the cabin fill with smoke. Researchers believe that passengers had a little over a minute to escape before being consumed by the flames, and are convinced that if more people had taken immediate action instead of remaining in their seats pretending like things were okay, the survival rate would have been much, much higher.</p>\n<p>To overcome the normalcy bias, you need to have an action plan on what you’re going to do in the event of an accident every single time you get on the plane. Know where the exits are. When you’ve spotted the nearest exit, count the number of rows between yourself and that row. Should it be nighttime, or the interior lights fail, you won’t have to succumb to confusion because you’ll know right where to go. Size up the passengers around you to see who could be potential roadblocks to your exit. If you’re traveling with kids, talk to your wife about who will be responsible for which kid in the event of an accident. Mentally rehearse quickly springing to action as soon as the plane comes to a stop.</p>\n<p>Another reason it’s important to have an action plan is that there’s a good chance you won’t have too much assistance from the flight crew. One study found that 45 percent of the flight attendants in survivable crashes are incapacitated in some way. You need to be ready to take action without direction from anyone.</p>\n<h2><strong>Read the Safety Card and Listen to the Flight Attendants</strong></h2>\n<h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34986 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2013/07/Safety-Card-21.jpg\" alt=\"Man on airplane reading safety card illustration.\" width=\"500\" height=\"432\"></img></h3>\n<p>Another thing you can do to overcome the Normalcy Bias is to read through the safety card as well as listen to the flight attendants when they give their pre-flight safety spiel. Just because you’ve amassed enough frequent flier miles to circumnavigate the globe 1,000 times, you’re definitely not off the hook. You may think you’re justifiably confident, but you’re probably complacent; in <a href=\"https://www.fire.tc.faa.gov/2007conference/files/Evacuation/WedAM/CorbettPassSafetyAware/CorbettPassSafetyAwarePres.pdf\">a report</a> published a few years ago, the FAA found that frequent fliers were the least informed on what to do and most susceptible to the normalcy bias in the event of a plane crash.</p>\n<p>Re-reading the safety card will remind you where the nearest exits are and what to do during a crash landing. As you read through the safety guidelines, formulate your action plan.</p>\n<h2><strong>Remember the Plus 3/Minus 8 Rule</strong></h2>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34987 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2013/07/Takeoff-Landing-21.jpg\" alt=\"Man in airplane seat looking at watch survive plane crash illustration.\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\"></img></p>\n<p>In the aviation world, <strong>Plus 3/Minus 8 refers to the first three minutes after takeoff and the last eight minutes before landing</strong>. According to flight crash investigators, close to 80% of all plane crashes occur during this timeframe. In between those times, the chances of a plane crash occurring drop dramatically. Thus, if you want to up your chances of survival, you need to be extra vigilant and ready to take action during the first 3 minutes after takeoff and the last 8 minutes before landing. Here are some suggestions from <em>The Survivor’s Club</em> on what to do and not do during Plus 3/Minus 8:</p>\n<ul><li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Don’t sleep.</span></li>\n<li>Make sure your shoes are on and secured. If you’re traveling with your wife or girlfriend, make sure she’s wearing flats and not high heels. It’s hard to run in stilettos.</li>\n<li>Don’t drink before getting on a plane. You want to be fully present in the event of a crash.</li>\n<li>Make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened — low and tight.</li>\n<li>Go over your action plan.</li>\n</ul><p>You don’t need to be paranoid during this time, just vigilantly relaxed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Put on Your Oxygen Mask as Soon as It Drops</strong></h2>\n<p>Airplane cabins are pressurized so you can breathe normally at 30,000 feet. When a cabin loses pressure, there’s so little air at high altitudes that getting oxygen to your bloodstream is next to impossible. That’s where oxygen masks come in. They pump pure oxygen into your nose and mouth so that you can get the air you need.</p>\n<p>In an event where the mask drops from above, put it on as soon as it drops. According to passenger studies, most folks think they can survive an hour without a mask after a plane loses pressure. You actually just have a few seconds. <strong>Just a few seconds of oxygen deprivation can cause mental impairment</strong>. If you want to get out of a malfunctioning airplane alive, you’ll want all your mental faculties intact when it lands/crashes. Also, follow the safety guidelines of securing your mask first before helping others secure theirs. You’re pretty much useless to others if you’re not getting oxygen to your brain.</p>\n<h2><strong>Assume Brace Position</strong></h2>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34983 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2013/07/Brace-Position-21.jpg\" alt=\"Man assuming brace position in airplane seat illustration.\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\"></img></p>\n<p>The idea of brace positions might seem a little silly; there’s no way that curling up in a ball would help you survive a plane crash, right? But research has shown that brace positions do indeed up the chances of survival in an emergency crash landing. The positions help reduce the velocity of your head when it inevitably slams into the seat in front of you. Moreover, they help minimize limb flailing.</p>\n<p>In addition to assuming a brace position, make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened — low and tight — over your lap. Those bad boys are designed to withstand 3,000 pounds of force, which is about three times as much as your body could handle without passing out.

Time to get to those exits as fast as you can. Remember, you only have 90 seconds.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/home_usa/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngoglia/2013/07/07/san-francisco-777-crash-why-did-so-many-passengers-evacuate-with-bags/&#38;refURL=https://www.artofmanliness.com&#38;referrer=https://www.artofmanliness.com\">you need to be reminded to forget your carry-on luggage</a>! It will slow you down and block others’ escape, and it may injure you or someone else if you try to get down the very steep inflatable slides with it. You can get another iPad when you return safely to your home.</p>\n<p>In your rush to get out of the plane, don’t forget your kids. That actually happens. Your brain does stupid things in disasters. Keep reminding yourself, “I have kids. I have kids. I have kids.” Ideally, you should have a plan with your wife and kids on who goes with who in case of an emergency exit.</p>\n<p>_____________________</p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QDLIWY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B001QDLIWY&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Survivor’s Club</a> by Ben Sherwood </em></p>\n<p><em>Illustrations by <a href=\"https://storytellersworkshop.com/\">Ted Slampyak</a></em></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-survive-a-plane-crash-10-tips-that-could-save-your-life/\">How to Survive a Plane Crash: 10 Tips That Could Save Your Life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/w9beYQRhMmM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 18:49:10 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"415196a4977f829d3a611f2854063470","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2013/07/Plane-Crash-Header-NEW-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn67@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-31-147_89415b64af89adc6.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/Five-Row-Rule-21.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn88@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-31-162_2a9b60bc805f071d.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2013/07/Safety-Card-21.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn43@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-31-249_d26f5e069b7b8f0e.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2013/07/Takeoff-Landing-21.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn31@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-31-288_487472e356985279.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2013/07/Brace-Position-21.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn40@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-31-269_539de8e444f2a167.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/w9beYQRhMmM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn91@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-31-222_b03b4e42072035b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916062},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"Keep Your House Cooler With a Quick 10-Minute Clean of Your Air Conditioner","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=137511","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137553\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/ac_header.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/ac_header.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/ac_header-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/ac_header-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/ac_header-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Got your home’s air conditioner chugging away, but your house doesn’t feel as cool as you think it would? It might be time to clean up its condenser.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outside condenser unit of your central air conditioner is basically a giant fan surrounded by tiny metal fins (there’s also a condenser in there). These tiny fins can get caked with dust, pollen, and other detritus, reducing airflow from your unit. Reduced airflow means a less efficient air conditioner, which means a warmer house and more expensive energy bills. </span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137550\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/dirty.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/dirty.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/dirty-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can increase your cooling efficiency and save some money in just 10 minutes by cleaning the fins of all that build-up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s how to do it. </span></p>\n<h2>Step 1: Turn off the electric power to your air-conditioning unit. </h2>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137549\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2320.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2320.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2320-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mine has a switch mounted on the wall right above my unit. Some units have a disconnect box where you have to pull out the disconnect block. Check your A/C’s owner’s manual to find out how to turn off the electric power to your unit. </span></p>\n<h2>Step 2: Hose it down with your garden hose.</h2>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137551\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2321-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2321-copy.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2321-copy-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleaning out the fins on your outdoor unit is as simple as spraying them down with a garden hose. Use moderate water pressure. If you use too much pressure, you risk bending and crimping the metal fins in the unit which will block airflow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look into the unit from above. You should be seeing water come through the fins. If you don’t, they’re still blocked. Keep hosing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on how clogged up your fins are, you should be able to knock this out in 10 minutes. Mine were especially clogged when I cleaned them out this week. I had to do two hosings to get out all the gunk. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_137552\" style=\"width: 610px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-137552\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-137552 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2323.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2323.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_2323-320x239.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-137552\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some of the gunk that got washed out of my A/C.

But ever since its dawning at the turn of the 20th century, its ethos has slowly, often imperceptibly, seeped into all aspects of life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything, from pot holders and parks, to restaurants and books, to surgeons and professors, can be rated by any individual. Churches survey their congregants to see if they’re satisfied with their services; colleges poll their students to assess their happiness with their education. Those who are looking for a romantic partner can browse through potential candidates on dating apps as easily as browsing the commodities on the shelves of a store.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though each individual wears many hats — husband, father, friend, scholar, employee, parishioner — each of these roles is colored by the modern meta identity: customer. As a customer, we feel entitled to numerous options, one of which must exactly meet our distinct tastes. As a customer, we’re only loyal until the opportunity for an upgrade comes along. As a customer, we’re always right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem, of course, is that as human beings, we’re often wrong. Very wrong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we approach life as a consumer, we shop around for things that meet us where we are. Or we demand that the available options change themselves to be better suited to meet us where we are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are aspects of life that have an intrinsic value that has nothing to do with our personal preferences. It’s not the thing that must shape itself to our desires, but our desires that must shape themselves to it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, when something challenges, disorients, and discomforts us, we can feel to give that person/philosophy/community/experience a one-star review. But though as a consumer it may not be something you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as a human being, it may be exactly what you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-be-not-a-consumer-of-life/\">Sunday Firesides: Be Not a Consumer of Life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/e3uJ3kbDwKs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 02:09:57 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"461f63b820b9cbb67a8e0af23bef4e53","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/Consumer-of-Life-Header-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn28@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-31-141_b10f194d6f3849b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/e3uJ3kbDwKs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn78@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-31-252_03c5f6bf777e1e48.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916060},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"Podcast #616: A Guide for the Journey to Your True Calling","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=113189","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"A Guide for the Journey to Your True Calling\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/a-guide-for-the-journey-to-your-true-calling/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This is a rebroadcast. It originally aired June 2020.</em></p>\n<p>One of the most burning questions in life is what it is you’re called to do with it. What is your life’s purpose? What great work are you meant to do?</p>\n<p>Guidance on this question can come from many sources, and my guest today says that one of the best is the Bhagavad Gita, a text of Hindu scripture thousands of years old. He’s a psychotherapist, yoga teacher, and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553386077/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0553386077&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Great Work of Your Life: A Guide for the Journey to Your True Calling</em></a>. <a href=\"https://www.stephencope.com/\">Stephen Cope</a> and I begin our conversation with an introduction to the Bhagavad Gita, the significant influence it’s had on philosophers and leaders for ages, and what it can teach us about making difficult decisions. We then discuss the insights the Gita offers on the four pillars of right living, beginning with discerning your true calling or sacred duty. We unpack the three areas in your life to examine for clues to your life’s purpose, and why that purpose may be small and quiet rather than big and splashy. Stephen then explains the doctrine of unified action, why you have to pursue your calling full out, and why that pursuit should include the habit of deliberate practice. We also discuss why it’s central to let go of the outcome of actions to focus on the work itself, and the need to turn your efforts over to something bigger than yourself. All along the way, Stephen offers examples of how these pillars were embodied in the lives of eminent individuals who lived out their purpose. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>A primer on the Bhagavad Gita</li>\n<li>Prominent individuals influenced by the Gita — Thoreau, Tolstoy, Gandhi, and more</li>\n<li>The universal nature of Arjuna’s struggles</li>\n<li>The 4 pillars of your “dharma” or calling </li>\n<li>How do you figure out your calling in life?</li>\n<li>Questions to ask about where to find that calling </li>\n<li>What it means to “think of the small as big” </li>\n<li>What does it look to go full-out on your dharma?</li>\n<li>Unifying all your actions to a single purpose and utilizing deliberate practice</li>\n<li>What does it mean to “let go of the fruits”?</li>\n<li>Beethoven as an example of letting go </li>\n<li>Turning your work over to something bigger than yourself </li>\n<li>What Harriet Tubman can teach us about letting go </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/american-philosophy-emerson-thoreau/\">A Treasure Trove of American Philosophy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-565-stillness-is-the-key/\">Stillness Is the Key</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-425-action-over-feelings/\">Action Over Feelings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/10-overlooked-truths-about-taking-action/\">10 Overlooked Truths About Taking Action</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-find-your-calling-in-life/\">How to Find Your Calling In Life</a></li>\n<li>AoM series on vocation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/a-primer-on-nietzsches-big-ideas/\">A Primer on Nietzsche’s Big Ideas</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-417-expect-great-things-the-mystical-life-of-henry-david-thoreau/\">Expect Great Things: The Mystical Life of Thoreau</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-secret-of-great-men-deliberate-practice/\">The Secret of Great Men: Deliberate Practice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-221-reach-your-peak/\">Reach Your Peak</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste-Camille_Corot\">Camille Corot</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Anderson\">Marian Anderson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats\">John Keats</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability\">Negative capability</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven\">Beethoven</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Yzv3rr\"><em>Harriet Tubman</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586380192/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1586380192&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">The Bhagavad Gita</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-113191 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/06/calling.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Work of your life book cover.\" width=\"301\" height=\"450\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

One of the most burning questions in life is what it is you’re called to do with it. What’s your life’s purpose? What great work are you meant to do? Guidance on this question could come from many sources, and my guest today says that one of the best is the Bhagavad Gita, a text of Hindu Scripture thousands of years old. His name is Stephen Cope. He’s a psychotherapist, yoga teacher, and the author of The Great Work of Your Life: A Guide for the Journey to Your True Calling. Stephen and I began our conversation with an introduction to the Bhagavad Gita, the significant influence it’s had on philosophers and leaders for ages, and what it can teach us about making difficult decisions.</p>\n<p>We then discuss the insights the Gita offers on the four pillars of right living, beginning with discerning your true calling or sacred duty. We unpack the three areas in your life to examine for clues to your life’s purpose, and why that purpose may be small and quiet rather than big and splashy. Stephen then explains the doctrine of unified action, why you have to pursue your calling full out, and why that pursuit should include the habit of deliberate practice. We also discuss why it’s central to let go of the outcome of actions to focus on the work itself, and the need to turn your efforts over to something bigger than yourself. Along the way, Stephen offers examples of how these pillars were embodied in the lives of eminent individuals who lived out their purpose. After the show is over, check out our show notes at AoM.is/gita.</p>\n<p>Alright. Stephen Cope, welcome to the show.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Thank you, Brett. I’m glad to be here.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: So you are the author of a book called The Great Work of Your Life: A Guide for the Journey to Your True Calling. And this book uses the Bhagavad Gita, it’s a piece of Hindu Scripture to explore this idea of a vocation or calling in your life. I read this book a few years ago. I was telling you off-air that after I read the book, that’s what introduced me to the Gita, and since then, I’ve read the Gita, at least once a year, ’cause it’s such a… It’s a cool piece of literature.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: So I’m curious, how did you discover the Bhagavad Gita?</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Well, the Bhagavad Gita is really the most well-known Scripture, yogic Scripture in India. So if you’re hanging out in Indian culture or Hindu culture or yogic culture, pretty much everybody knows about the Gita. There are a number of great Scriptures in the yoga tradition, but the Gita is certainly the most well-known. It’s the kind of thing that everybody in every little village in India knows. And there are images of Krishna and Arjuna, the two main characters pretty much everywhere on temples. And so once I came into the yoga world, it’s pretty much inevitable that you bump into the Gita.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And as you said, it’s a piece of Hindu Scripture, but as we’ll talk about in this book, a lot of great Western thinkers for a couple of centuries now have been influenced by the Gita. I mean, who are some of these individuals?</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: I mean, honestly, it’s remarkable. I, writing on the Gita as I have, I keep bumping into more. So there is probably the first major Western philosopher was Schopenhauer who wrote in the early 19th century. The Gita was translated in English as late as, I think 1787 or 1785. But where you start really beginning to see its influence is with Thoreau and Emerson. The transcendental was unconquered in the 1820s, ’30s, ’40s, ’50s, and Thoreau picked it up and was profoundly influenced by it. And you can kind of draw a direct line then between Thoreau’s influence and Emerson as well. And then Tolstoy, who picked it up. And from Tolstoy, a direct line to Gandhi and then to Aldous Huxley, who wrote a brilliant book called The Perennial Philosophy. And from there to Himmler to Martin Luther King and to Bobby Kennedy. So there’s this direct line back to the Great American philosophers, Emerson and Thoreau.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: So let’s dig into the Gita. And for those who… Before we get to some of the lessons and take away that you talk about in your book, can you give people who aren’t familiar with the story sort of the big picture overview of what’s going on with it, and the main characters, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Sure, sure. Yeah, it’s a great tale and like most tales, it was meant to be spoken verbally, even though it was written down somewhere in the, probably the 2nd century of the common era. The tale is about… It happens on the night before a great war, the battle of Kurukshetra, on the field of Kuru. And the two major protagonists are Arjuna and Arjuna is a warrior. He is the greatest warrior of the kingdom of Kuru and his father was the king, now the deposed king of the kingdom of Kuru. And the other major character is Krishna, who’s his charioteer. And Krishna, of course, is God in disguise, we don’t find that out until the middle of the book. But the whole book is a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna at the edge of the battlefield.</p>\n<p>So you can imagine there’s a huge battle, an epic battle about to take place the next morning. And Arjuna is very conflicted about whether or not to fight in this battle. The backstory is that the kingship has been stolen by one of Arjuna’s cousins, and that’s what precipitated this war. And he realizes as he sits with Krishna that he’s got a dilemma that he cannot solve, and the dilemma is this. Because he’s a warrior and he was part of a very rigid caste system, it was his duty, it was his sacred duty to fight in a war, to fight in a just war, and this was a just war. On the other hand, he realized that he was most likely gonna kill his own kin because his cousins were on the other side of this battle. And so the very first chapter, he investigates this dilemma. He must fight in the battle because it’s his calling, it’s his sacred duty, but if he fights, he will kill kin, in either case, he will have to go to purgatory in the Hindu view, four lifetimes. And so he’s presented with this dilemma that he cannot solve. It’s greater than his own consciousness and he sits with Krishna through the night as Krishna expounds to him his way through this particular dilemma. And the way through is actually by completely expanding his consciousness so that he understands that the war itself is not really a real external war, but a battle going on within himself. The tale is really about the moral dilemmas that each of us face in life and how we work our way through them.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Now, I love the set up of the story and that’s why I think it’s so relatable, I think why so many individuals even in the West have related to this, with Arjuna.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah, exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: It’s just like, “I don’t know what to do. I have no idea what to do.” And that’s like that’s most of life. Like, “I don’t know what to do.”</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah, in fact, he says… Arjuna in the beginning at the end of the first chapter falls to the floor of the chariot and he says, “Krishna, I cannot fight this fight. Conflicting sacred duties confound my mind.” And of course, we run into that all the time, conflicting sacred duties. Should I do A or should I do B? What am I called to do and how do I know what my calling is? It’s a great set up, that first chapter and then there are 17 more chapters where Krishna describes the slow and deliberate process of understanding your calling.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And that’s what I love about it too, that dialogue he explains the idea of duty or dharma. And then yoga, which in the West, we think yoga is like you’d downward dog or whatever, but yoga, it’s all about taking action.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Exactly, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And that’s what Krishna tells Arjuna what you have to do. “You have to action to fulfill your dharma.”</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: That’s right. Basically, Krishna teaches Arjuna what he calls the Path of Inaction-in-Action, the Path of Naishkarmya-karman or inaction-in-action, which turns out to be a profound reframe of action. And there are four steps. First of all, Krishna says, “Look, don’t even think about being the guy who doesn’t take action because we all act all the time.” In the contemplative traditions, they talk about actions of mind, speech and body so even your mind is taking action. The four pillars of this Path of Inaction-in-Action are, number one, discern your dharma. That is discern and know your true calling in this lifetime. Number two, do it full out, bring everything you’ve got to the performance of your dharma, of your calling. And third, let go of the outcome. Krishna says to Arjuna, “Whether you’re winning or losing or failing is not your issue, your only issue is have you determined what your dharma is and are you doing it full out?” He says, “It’s better to fail at your own dharma than to succeed at someone else’s dharma.”</p>\n<p>And then finally, Krishna says to Arjuna, “Turn this whole thing over to me.” In other words, over to God or over to something bigger than yourself, over to some bigger meaning than your ego or yourself. And so we have the four pillars, discern your dharma, do it full out, the second one is called the doctrine of unified action because it calls you to unify all of your action around your dharma. The third is let go of the fruits and then finally turn it over to God or whatever version of God you have.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Alright, let’s dig in the deep. You spend the rest of your book, The Great Work of Your Life, exploring these four pillars and you do that by… Through examples of people you’ve worked with personally in your practice, in your work, but also the lives of what we’d consider great individuals who may have… Some of them directly were influence by the Gita, others, they just kinda got the idea. That first pillar, which is know your dharma or look to your dharma, let’s talk about this. How do you figure out what your dharma is in the first place, your calling, your sacred duty in life?</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Well, this is where most of us get stuck. The truth is that when the Bhagavad Gita was written in that context, everybody was born into their own sacred calling. It was a very complex caste system and you were… Arjuna was born a warrior. It was his duty to be a warrior. That was called svadharma. And of course, that kind of rigid duty to the social order into your birth no longer applies in our culture. Now, we have to dig down inside, look at our circumstances and our life situation and our own gifts to determine what’s our dharma, what’s our true calling. The word dharma is based on the root D-H-R-I, dhri, which means to uphold. And the view that still translates to us is the idea that everybody has a responsibility to their particular set of gifts, their particular set of capacities. And so no longer is the duty to the dharma into which you were born, but now it’s to… As Carol Pearson, the great Jungian psychologist says, “You have a responsibility to your gifts and your own idiosyncratic opportunities that you must fulfill in this lifetime.”</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: That reminds me of the idea that I think, Pindar, he’s a Roman poet, he said, “Become who you are.” Like Nietzsche picked that up. You know what I mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: That’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: That idea of becoming who you are is looking at your situation. It might not mean… Your dharma might not be like, “I’m gonna be president of the United States.” It could be even smaller than that.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Oh, absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: But if you find that, you’re supposed to go full out with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Exactly, exactly. I’d like to say, because I’ll tell you the truth, a lot of the time I spend with people looking at these notions is really spent on helping people to discern their dharma. The whole process of discernment. There’re three particular areas that I call useful hunting grounds for dharma. One is, is I often ask people the question, What’s lighting you up? So the first question to ask yourself is, what is it out there in the world in your life now that’s lighting you up, that gives you energy, that fascinates you, that draws you? That is not necessarily your dharma, but it’s a very interesting finger pointing toward Dharma.</p>\n<p>The second useful hunting ground I’ve found is very different from what lights you up. The question here is, what do you see as your sacred duty in this life? So sacred duty is something different. It may not necessarily light you up, it may, and I like to… The whole question of duty is complex. I like to say, Your duty is that thing which if you do not do it will result in a profound sense of self betrayal on your part. And that definition of duty moves the locus of duty from the exterior that is duties that are foisted on us that we don’t actually own to our own interior self where the real locus of duty is found.</p>\n<p>And then the third area… So we have what lights you up, what do you consider or know to be your sacred duty? And the third area is look at challenges and difficulties in your life because very often, people find their duty or their calling or even what’s lighting them up, arising directly out of challenges. So a divorce, an illness, a change in job. This is another important hunting ground for dharma. So between those three, you have some interesting arrows pointing at your own particular dharma, and I highly recommend that people explore those three areas very systematically.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: The one section in this, when you talk about Look to your Dharma, that really when I first read it, it’s… I think about it all the time, and as you explore the life Henry David Thoreau and him trying to our out his dharma, and the idea that you got from Thoreau is, think of the small as big.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Because I think a lot of people when they confront this question of What’s my calling in life? They typically think it’s gotta be big, it’s gotta be where I’m know.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: That’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And that’s not necessarily the case. So tell us about Thoreau’s experience with the Gita and how it helped him find his dharma.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Well, this, by the way, is what I call the false notion of the romance of dharma, the idea that it has to be something big, the idea that you have to leave your job selling insurance and move to Paris and become a great painter. That’s a typical romantic notion. The truth is, most people’s dharmas are already somewhere in their lives, they’ve already stumbled into some aspect of their dharma. But Thoreau is an interesting example. Thoreau of course, was a brilliant man. He was educated at Harvard, he spoke many languages, he wrote Greek and Latin, and he, of course, lived in Concord surrounded by the likes of Emerson and the Alcotts and all these great American writers and philosophers.</p>\n<p>And he got it in his head early on that he wanted to become a great writer, and so with that in mind, he moved to New York City, which is where the only great writers in America at that time were thought to be and were really all there. And he was a complete failure in New York City. He was a woodsman, he was way too gruff and rough, and he was not accepted into the salons of New York literary society. And finally dejected, he dragged his butt back to Concord, the little town where he lived and grew up and decided when he got back that this was his home, this is where he was gonna put his stake in the ground. And it wasn’t long after that that he went to Walden Pond where he built his cabin on some land that Emerson loaned him, and decided to do his great experiment. He said, I have come to the woods to learn to live deliberately and not define when I come to die that I had not lived.</p>\n<p>So Thoreau went to Walden, the teeniest little life you can imagine, a little cabin in the woods by the pond, and one of the few books he took with him was the Bhagavad Gita. He read the Gita daily, he considered himself a yogi, and keep in mind, this is in the early part of the 19th century, and he realized that whatever you’re doing, whatever action you’re taking, whatever your calling is, and now he understood that his calling was to investigate the small life and to keep even getting it smaller, remember he finally had to give up one of his two spoons in his second year at Walden, and to discover how big the small life actually is.</p>\n<p>So I actually quote from the Tao Te Ching there where it says, Think of the small as large and the few as many. Thoreau discovered in the Gita the notion that all actions have mystic consequences. So, the smallest actions as long as they’re aligned with your dharma, makes some kind of huge ripple in the world. So Thoreau took on the task of investigating his world just as he saw it, and as he found it around his little cabin. And strangely enough, just as the Bhagavad Gita said, Mystic actions connected with your dharma make big splashes in the pond. And so, of course, we now think of Thoreau writing from his little cabin as one of the great philosophers and writers of American life and literature. He once said, which quote I love, “I have traveled extensively and conquered.” And by that he meant that his inward journey in conquer to the soul of this one little town, and by focusing down into the soul of this one beautiful little New England town, he pretty much found the whole world there. You know, when Krishna was born, his nurse looked into his open mouth, and saw the whole universe there. And that’s precisely what Thoreau did at Walden.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And you make this point in the book, Thoreau’s experiment at Walden was even smaller. I mean, he was basically in the backyard of his parents house [chuckle] and that his mom still brought him cookies and sandwiches. And sometimes people criticize Thoreau for that, like, “Oh, he really didn’t do anything, he just basically backpacked in his backyard.” But it’s like the idea, he went full bore into it and was able to do some amazing work by doing that.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Well, and one of the great things about Thoreau was, we all know the quote, “Find your own distant drummer and follow it.” Thoreau caught on to the idea that it’s our idiosyncratic, highly particular calling that has the juice. He said, Thoreau said, “All human beings should constantly be on the trail of their true nature. Because it is in following and claiming their true nature that they connect with the Divine.” So, Thoreau said, “Find your bone,” and here’s a great image of a dog. Find your bone, gnaw on it, bury it, dig it up again, gnaw on it more. So, he found his bone in his writing and in his nature study and it was through being uniquely idiosyncratically his own true self, that he broke into the field of the Divine. And in this he was relentless. So, Emerson as you know his buddy was much more polished, and was a bit of a more professional philosopher, but Thoreau was this rugged individualist. And it was he that really lived out in so many ways Emerson’s own views about living your idiosyncratic truth.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Alright, so that’s… Look to your dharma, discover your dharma, so you can look to what lights you up, look what’s at your sacred duty or look at problems in your life and then realize and understand that your dharma, your duty might be smaller than you think it is. And that’s okay.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah, exactly. In fact, I use the story there of a friend of mine who’s a nurse who kept saying to me, “Steve, I just… I have such a small dharma.” And finally now 10 years later, her life has been turned around because she fully embraces the beautiful work that is her daily work as a nurse, no longer thinking of it as small. So, think of the small as large, and the few as many.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Alright, so once you find your dharma, you’re supposed to go full out on it. That’s the second pillar. What does that look like?</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: So again, that’s called the doctrine of unified action. And the idea here is that once you’ve found your dharma, you bring everything you’ve got to it. Krishna said to Arjuna, “This is the passion that is not contrary to the dharma.” And in other words, you should be living a passionate life built around your dharma. One of the characters I used to explore this is Susan B. Anthony, who, as a young girl growing up in Upstate New York, realized that she was… Women were in a kind of prison in those days, they had very few rights. And she realized that she didn’t wanna go along with that, with some of the mores of the day in relationship to women. Women couldn’t own property or inherit property, very often were kept in the home. So, she became a teacher, her world began to broaden, but teaching was one of the few professions that women could do back in her day. She became a teacher, and then she became an activist. First of all she got involved in Temperance, which was non-drinking and the Women’s Temperance Movement. And finally, she realized that women were never going to be empowered in our society until they got the vote. And once she realized that, she was onto her dharma, she realized that she was gonna to spend the rest of her life organizing and focusing on this one high goal, which was for women to be enfranchised.</p>\n<p>She doubted and she often said, “I probably won’t live to see it, but I’m gonna spend my life doing it.” And then she became an incredibly effective person in that dharma because of unification of action. Everything she did, her writing, her speaking, her traveling, was all organized systematically around her bigger goal. So for example, she lived in Upstate New York and she loved beautiful clothes, but she realized she had to get up on these podiums and speak to auditoriums full of angry pissed off men, and she didn’t wanna piss them off more by wearing flowery clothing so she wore black. At a certain point she had to learn to be a great speaker ’cause she really had to shout down these rooms of upset people. So she took on a coach, she took on Elizabeth Cady Stanton to help her write her speeches and learn to give them.</p>\n<p>Everything she did was aimed like the narrow point of the spear toward her bigger goal. And so, her life became a kind of guided missile of energy, and she was a perfect example of this doctrine of unified action, “Bring it, bring everything you’ve got.” As a writer, I do that. I try to do that every day. I sit down and bring it. And you’d find out as a writer that your life ends up becoming organized around your dharma in the sense that you have to take good care of yourself, you have to sleep well and eat well, because when you get up at 8:00 in the morning and arrive at your desk, you wanna be ready. So, this doctrine of unity in action has served me, and it’s the second important pillar of Krishna’s approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And then you also highlight… It also… This idea of unified action means deliberate practice, like learning how to do, you fulfill your dharma the best you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yes, exactly, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And I loved… I didn’t know about this guy, but Camille Corot…</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Camille Corot, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: He’s a painter that sort of exemplified, you thought was deliberate practice in the Gita way.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah, so Corot is a fascinating figure. He was a great French landscape painter who… Well, he was fascinated by painting as a kid. And from the beginning he started painting outdoors. This is called plein air in French. And then like most of the artists of his day, went to Italy for his training, but he soon caught on to this idea of what we now called deliberate practice. And what deliberate practice means is that you intend and organize all of your actions around your dharma, around your calling to eventuate in the mastery of that calling. So, Corot was one of the very first painters who, when he was painting in Rome, for example, he would paint the Palatine Hill and he painted over and over and over again every day from the same view point, but with different kinds of light. And what he was doing was deliberately practicing how to capture the light, the special light of Italy. And deliberate practice, we now know that most of the people that we think of masters and geniuses, actually are the result of practicing their craft deliberately. And what that means is you practice with the intention of improving. You practice in such a way that you get regular feedback, you create loops of feedback.</p>\n<p>So you have not only your own eyes, but someone else’s eyes on your work. You immerse yourself in the culture of that particular crowd. So, Corot immersed himself in the culture of painters. You let go of the idea of perfectionism and take risks. So there’s a whole series, and I lay this out in my book of things that are considered now deliberate practice. And we know that almost any kind of mastery takes approximately 10,000 hours to master. And paradoxically, I found that this is also true of meditation. So those monks that you read currently and that the Dalai Lama brings with him to his big conferences, they’ve practiced their meditation practices and their breathing practices for 10,000 hours just like Corot did. And Corot, as a result, became one of the greatest masters of French landscape painting. Monet said, at a big exhibition once he said, and all the great painters were there, he said, “There’s only one master here and that’s Camille Corot.”</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: So it sounds like this… And from the Hindu perspective, this idea of going full out, it’s about focus. It’s what you do in the contemplative of practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: It’s learning how to focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: It’s all about focus and concentration. And if you read the other scriptures of yoga, The Yoga Sutra, for example, it lays out a very clear series of steps in which the mind becomes increasingly concentrated on the object of attention, and in this case, in Corot’s case, for example, painting. It can be anything. I’m writing a chapter right now on Marian Anderson, the great black contralto, and looking at the way in which she systematically promoted the mastery of her voice by becoming increasingly concentrated on the most subtle aspects of the way in which the body produces sound.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: So the next pillar, so you go full out, the second pillar, the next pillar is, let go of the fruits. And this is probably the most well-known idea from the Gita. I’m sure people have heard some version of it, but it’s…</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Right. That’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: What Krishna told Arjuna was, “You have a right to the work, but not to the fruits.”</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Exactly. This is a toughie. And I use… In this particular section, I use John Keats as an example. Because Keats, by the time he was 18, Keats who was then in medical school and was really bad at medical school, discovered that his true calling was to poetry. So by the age of 18, he said, “I’m spending the rest of my life dedicated to poetry and I intend to be the greatest poet in the English language.” He was determined to, as he said, “wear the laurel wreath,” which is the wreath the victor. And his career faltered around that, because it turns out that grasping and craving and clinging to an exalted outcome is probably the worst thing you can do to actually inhibit that outcome. I teach a lot of young musicians up here at Kripalu, and one of the first things I noticed about them is they’re all tied up in knots trying to perfectly execute their musical charge, whatever it is, piano or voice, and it turns out that grasping and craving and clinging, holding on to outcome in that way with kind of a death grip on it, actually inhibits fluid performance, inhibits what Csikszentmihalyi calls flow states. And of course, people are so resistant to this idea thinking that, “If I’m not grasping to success in business or to perfection in my music, then how am I ever gonna get anywhere?”</p>\n<p>Well, it turns out that the contemplative traditions have a completely different view of that, and that is the idea that it’s not grasping that actually eventuates in mastery, it’s aspiration itself. So, to aspire to something is to learn to deliberately practice it as a craft, and of course, this is what Keats had to go through. Keats had this big competition with one of his poet friends, and they were both gonna write these great long epic poems, and as a result of his grasping for it to be the greatest, Keats realized he was inhibiting himself. So, Keats himself came up with something that he called negative capability, wherein he realized that the systematic regular, non-sexy practice of practicing his craft without any fanfare and without getting ahead of himself in terms of wanting to be the greatest poet in the world. Actually that was the formula for greatness.</p>\n<p>So it’s a paradox, he called it negative capability because he said you have to let go of those grandiose ideas, you have to stand on the edge of the cliff of your skill and be willing to take risk and be willing to fail and be willing to go into the mystery, and it’s out of that soup that actually comes greatness. And so, once Keats got on to that, of course, he wrote some of the great… He did write some of the greatest poetry in the English language. Unfortunately, he died when he was, I believe, 27 of tuberculosis, but in those short, almost 10 years of writing, he became indeed one of the great poets.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: I mean, I think it’s such a powerful idea, ’cause as you just said, it is a paradox, but you see, it’s a universal idea. You see it in other faiths and other philosophies, stoicism kind of have something similar to that.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: That’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And Buddhism, you have the same thing. Like, you can even say in Christianity, there’s that idea, and grace is probably like that. You care, but you don’t care about the outcomes, right, like you…</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: That’s classic TS Eliot, let me care and not care.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Yeah, that’s how I described that idea, it’s like, you care but not care, that’s…</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And I’ve experienced that a few times, and when I have experienced it, it’s the most amazing feeling in the world, and then I’ve just been trying to get back to that, but it’s really hard ’cause you’re… It’s so easy to go fall back to it, like, I gotta grasp for the outcome, I gotta get this…</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Exactly, exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: It’s so hard, it’s like you just… You know like a… I don’t know, it’s almost like a drug where you experience it, you just spend the rest of your life trying to… You start grasping at the… [chuckle] It’s kind of a paradox and you start grasping at, not grasping [chuckle] at the problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: That’s right, that’s right. Well, you know what’s funny, Brett is that grasping and craving, of course, in Buddhism, as in yoga, is seen as the root of suffering, and yet it’s so built into our nature that there are… As you go through the stages of refinement toward enlightenment, let’s say in the Buddhist tradition, there are multiple stages at which you have to let go of even grasping for highly refined ecstatic states. You have to let go of grasping for enlightenment itself. Grasping itself becomes more and more refined until you have to let go of those final stages of it, and that’s when you fall into enlightenment. I mean, the Buddha himself, of course, before his enlightenment was… Had been practicing for six years in the forest this amazingly difficult ascetic feat, so he was eating half a grain of rice a day, and this was called the ascetic Buddha, and it wasn’t till he let that go… He let go of the grasping, ’cause it was grasping inherent in the way he’d set up his practice and finally he let it go. He sat down, he accepted that bowl of milk from Sujata, the farm girl, and that was when he became enlightened.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And another character you explored for this idea of letting go of the fruits is Beethoven, and Beethoven, a student of the Gita, and he faced… For the most of his life, he had a tough life.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Oh, men.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: You talk about his father was basically abusive towards him since he was a boy, he was awkward socially, and then at the height of his career, he starts going deaf, and he basically almost… I mean, he started contemplating suicide at this point.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: That’s right, that’s right. I mean, talk about having to let go, Beethoven had one huge gift which was, he understood from very early in life that his calling was to music, and he also was already on the Thoreau idea that it was his idiosyncratic view and understanding and insight and genius that was gonna lead him to fulfill his dharma in life, which he did wonderfully. You know, Beethoven… It wasn’t until Beethoven discovered Bach that… And Bach was long dead when Beethoven discovered him, but when he heard Bach’s fugues, he said, “Oh, my God, you can do that? You can actually do that?” It freed him to claim his own idiosyncratic genius, and he lived for that and he lived through it, and he lived magnificently, and yes, he had a quote from the Gita under the glass of his desk. And that was a shocker to me because I’m a huge Beethoven fan and I’d never heard that until I read this little footnote in Maynard Solomon’s biography. Oh, yeah, Beethoven, the Bhagavad Gita.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And he hid them, I think the quote was just about knowing your duty and then once you know it, you know what to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Do it full out. Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: I think that was one of the most powerful ideas from the Gita, this idea of not remembering who you are.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Like Krishna says to Arjuna, the reason why you’re conflicted and the reason why you’re anxious is like you forgot who you are. I think this leads toward that final part of the final pillar, which is turn it over to God or turn it over to something bigger than yourself. I think that this idea of remembering who you are, that’s related to that idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Well, this is actually where in many ways, the Gita really starts there. One of the very first things Krishna says to Arjuna is, “Dude, you don’t have a clue who you really are, you’re stuck in this little box, this little idea of self, this little idea of ego, and you don’t realize that in your true nature you have the same consciousness as Brahman.” This is very central to the Hindu view and the yogic view is the idea that each individual soul or atman is in its very essence one with Brahman or the divine consciousness, consciousness itself. And the idea that’s very different from a lot of Western religion is that you can actually realize this true nature, this part of yourself that knows and sees and comprehends and understands and attains the same kind of consciousness that we call in that tradition, Brahman or the divine.</p>\n<p>And again, this marks it as quite different in many ways, although there are many Western theologians who write from the same place. Eckhart, not Eckhart Tolle but the original Eckhart, back in I think the 13th century, who stressed that view that we’re all made in the image and likeness of the Divine. And in most of the contemplative traditions, it’s understood that there’s a very systematic path of claiming that consciousness and of becoming one with that consciousness and a lot of it involves systematic path of moral purification.</p>\n<p>But in that particular chapter, I use both Gandhi and Harriet Tubman, and I love the Harriet Tubman story because Tubman had no formal education whatsoever and like so many, she was a slave on a plantation in the south, and as so many slaves were in those days, she was educated by listening to Bible stories at night around the fire or the hearth or whatever. So she was actually remarkably well educated in a lot of the things that really count. And she escaped from her plantation and followed what they call followed the drinking gourd, followed the North Star, found her way to Philadelphia, which was a safe city, and then out of the blue, experienced this call from God, and it was nothing less than God knocking on her door saying, “Harriet, I want you to go back to the plantation and free others.” And she was like, “No way, not me. That was tough enough the first time.” And God kept knocking, that inner voice, that divine voice kept assailing her and finally she said, “Okay, I will do it, but you’re gonna have to lead me because I do not know how to do this, I’m not trained to do this.”</p>\n<p>Well, Harriet Tubman became… They called her the engineer because she engineered the freedom of so many fugitive slaves, she’d bring them back north, she’d go down undercover back into dangerous territory and free five or 10 or 15 or 25 slaves and lead them to safety, not just to Philadelphia, but she’d led them all the way to Canada, and then when they got to Canada, they would stop on the bridge, the whole group of them. And by the way, the people who followed her knew that she had a kind of connection with this inner voice, she called it a sixth sense that was infallible. So if she said, Stop, you stop. If she said, Hide behind the tree, or duck or bury yourself under that mound of dirt, you did it because she was connected in that way, she was being guided. And then when they got to the bridge in Canada, they’d all stop, and they’d have a prayer service where she would turn it back over to God and say, “This was not me people, this was God. So pray to God, worship God, begin to listen to that… To your own still small voice inside and allow yourself to be guided just as I have.”</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And I think she was an example of action requires faith, but faith also requires action.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yeah, exactly. No, she was a woman of action her whole life.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: The other character you talked about is Gandhi, which is interesting about Gandhi, he’s Indian, he’s Hindu, and he became sort of this embodiment of the Gita, but he didn’t discover the Gita, he had to go to England and [chuckle] be amongst the English to finally… That’s when he first discovered the Bhagavad Gita.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: He did. And he discovered it in English. He did not discover it in Hindi or Gujarat. I believe he was born in Gujarat province, and he was immediately taken by… It was like he recognized in that scripture the spiritual genius of his own culture, which don’t forget, in Gandhi’s day, that culture had been downtrodden by 300 years of British colonial rule and in so many ways had lost the spiritual self-esteem of their culture. So Gandhi gets to England, and he’s introduced to the Gita, and he begins to light up with an understanding of the spiritual genius of India and the subcontinent of India. Then of course, he goes to South Africa, where he puts all of the teachings of the Gita. The Gita is, as he said, his guidebook for life. And he said, “If you wish to know what a life based on the Gita looks like, look at my life ’cause my life has been entirely based on the Gita.”</p>\n<p>So he went to South Africa, where he understood the Gita to be talking about non-separateness. And he began working with Indians who’d lived in South Africa, and who were hugely dominated and colonialized by their Dutch colonizers. So he got his first taste of helping to resist in a non-violent way in South Africa before he came back to India where he became the champion of non-violent resistance, what he called ‘satyagraha’ or ‘soul power’.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: And the idea that you hit with Gandhi was turning everything over to God. And he had this idea, Gandhi had this idea of you gotta take yourself to zero.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Yes, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: It’s not about you anymore. It’s about something bigger than yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: Exactly. Gandhi took literally what Krishna speaks to Arjuna in that very first chapter where he says, “Arjuna, by the way, you are not your body.” And Arjuna’s of course terrified of being injured in this war, and Gandhi’s took literally, “You’re not your body, and you needn’t be terrified of being injured or even killed in the line of duty, in the line of doing your dharma.” So, much of take yourself to zero for Gandhi was really take your ego out of it, take your own self-importance and aggrandizement out of it. Rather, look at the good of the whole. So Gandhi was all about looking at the good of the whole, looking at the good of the whole community. He was Martin Luther King’s predecessor in understanding the importance of what King called the blessed community.</p>\n<p>So yeah, that was Gandhi. Take yourself to zero. And of course, he did. He didn’t count the cost to himself of so many of his actions. He didn’t count the cost of going to jail or doing a fast. He was quite willing to die. That last fast that he did, he almost died when the Hindus and Muslims had again begun to war on each other, he went on a fast until it’d stopped, and there was take yourself to zero. Gandhi was incredibly creative. He didn’t see himself as living inside this little box of fear, which allowed him to be hugely creative in the way he moved, and he was constantly frustrating and freaking out his own supporters because he’d do stuff that nobody had ever thought of before or tried before, and it was just because he’d been freed from what they call in the tradition, grasping to views and beliefs about how things should be. He was much more interested in how things are.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Well, Stephen, it’s been a great conversation. For those who want to explore the Gita more, is there a translation in English that you recommend for folks?</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: There’s a great translation that I prefer using and it’s by a guy named Eknath Easwaran, E-A-S-W-A-R-A-N, who actually has studied… Well, he’s an Indian scholar, who moved to United States in the ’50s and became a professor in Southern California, I believe at Berkeley, and from there, translated the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita and some of Buddhist texts. And it’s an extremely practical, but also accurate and a guide to the Gita and the Upanishads. And part of it is that he accompanies his translations with an essay for each chapter that really helps you to understand frankly, and you know this now that you’ve read the Gita. You can’t read it without a guide because there’s so much sophisticated philosophy thrown in it. It’s a little bit of a dog’s dinner in that way in the sense that you really need a guide to wade through it. And I found Easwaran, I think partly because he understood the Western mind ’cause he’d lived here, is particularly useful. And there’s a fairly new edition of it you can find on Amazon.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Yeah, that’s the translation. I have it. It’s very…</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: That’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Yeah, the commentary is very useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: So useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Where can people go to learn more about your book and your work?</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Cope</strong>: They can log on to my website, which is www.stephencope.com. I am the Scholar Emeritus at Kripalu Center, which is the largest center in America for the study and practice of yoga in Western Massachusetts. Unfortunately, we’re locked down with COVID right now, but we will open again and I teach a lot at Kripalu. I teach all over the country. But you can find my events on my website there.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay</strong>: Fantastic. Well, Stephen Cope, thanks for this time.

They shouldn’t be surprised, my guest would say, if they never had a strategy in place for reaching their goals.</p>\n<p>His name is Stanley K. Ridgley, he’s a former military intelligence officer, a professor of business, and the lecturer of The Great Courses course, <a href=\"https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/strategic-thinking-skills\"><em>Strategic Thinking Skills</em></a>. Today on the show, Stanley explains why strategy, whether implemented in business, the military, or your personal life, is so important when it comes to dealing with uncertainty, making decisions, winning competitions, and getting to where you want to go. He first explains why following “best practices” is not the same thing as following a strategy, and how real strategy is a cycle of mission-setting, analysis, and execution that never ends. He unpacks what strategic intent is, and why it’s so important to be clear on yours. We then discuss two main approaches to strategy — cost leadership and differentiation, and why you need to adopt the latter in your own life, and stop treating yourself like a commodity. We also get into why indirect attacks on competitors can be more effective than frontal assaults, where people go wrong when it comes to the execution of their strategy, and the role that intuition plays for the master strategist. We end our conversation with what you can start doing today for five minutes in the morning to get closer to your goals. Along the way, Stanley gives examples from both war and business on how the art of strategy works in the field.</p>\n<h2>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in the Podcast</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/5-tools-for-thriving-in-uncertainty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/5-tools-for-thriving-in-uncertainty/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1626185541399000&#38;usg=AFQjCNGecaYcaRFhEAGm2XpsdE7QCk7t2Q\">5 Tools for Thriving in Uncertainty</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-630-the-strategy-paradox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-630-the-strategy-paradox/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1626185541399000&#38;usg=AFQjCNHogiy0H14rS3sO8VaEZtNRvXKp-w\">AoM Podcast #630: The Strategy Paradox</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/ooda-loop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/ooda-loop/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1626185541399000&#38;usg=AFQjCNFC8zLUX6vEBKU_Y-_O9mLMPSsdgw\">How to Master the OODA Loop</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1626185541399000&#38;usg=AFQjCNHIc2D7_WF_PRABPffoVKLluYQzbw\">JFK’s “decision to go to the moon” speech</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1626185541399000&#38;usg=AFQjCNHsUE2gR7oRYtIBthyoqqmKKJ-2ug\">Digital Equipment Corporation </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._H._Liddell_Hart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._H._Liddell_Hart&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1626185541399000&#38;usg=AFQjCNGEwpG_j28GLLKjKANJl8ofJb_mOQ\">B.H.

After getting out of the service, the newly-minted veteran moved to New York City, where, as reported in </span><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hBUqSh\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve McQueen: In His Own Words</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “He handcrafted sandals, lugged radiators out of condemned buildings, loaded bags in a post office, ran errands for a local bookie, recapped tires in a garage, sold encyclopedias door-to-door, made artificial flowers in a musty basement, sold pottery in a large department store, and repaired television sets.” Before he finally found success as an actor, McQueen would also drive and repair taxi cabs, sling drinks as a bartender, and try his hand at laying tile. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the sheer breadth and adventurousness of Steve McQueen’s resume was unique, having an interesting and varied background was actually quite common amongst actors of his generation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before making it in movies, Sean Connery served in the Royal Navy from ages 16 to 19 (voluntarily; this was after World War II), and worked as a milkman, lifeguard, truck driver, laborer, and artist’s model. He competed in bodybuilding competitions and once used his strength to take on a group of cutthroat gang members who had been harassing him; though it was a six-to-one fight, Connery so held his own (at one point putting two of the thugs down by clunking their heads together), that he earned the gang’s respect as a “hard man” and was subsequently left alone. As a 16-year-old, James Garner did a stint as a merchant mariner at the end of WWII, then joined the Army National Guard; he served 14 months in Korea as a rifleman and earned two Purple Hearts for being twice wounded. Even Paul Newman, who was a little prettier than his contemporaries, served as a turret gunner in a torpedo bomber during the Second World War. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writers of the early to mid twentieth century had similarly compelling backgrounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the age of 22, Jack L</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ondon had worked in a cannery, electrical plant, and laundry facility, taught himself to sail, evaded the law as an </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_pirate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oyster pirate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tramped around the country by rail (which earned him, like McQueen, a conviction for vagrancy and a month-long stint in jail), traveled the Pacific aboard a seal-hunting schooner, and ventured into the Klondike in search of gold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Ralph Ellison turned 25, he had attempted to become a professional trumpet player, lived at a YMCA in New York City (where he met Langston Hughes), and worked as a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shoeshine boy, waiter, short-order cook, drugstore clerk, paperboy, janitor, baker, receptionist for a renowned psychiatrist, dentist’s assistant (though only 12 at the time, “he learned,” <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3AxWfZh\">a biography</a> reports, “how to cast inlays, pour plaster-of-Paris models, and make crowns and some of the simpler bridges”), tailor’s assistant, sculptor’s assistant, and laboratory assistant at a paint company. When he was accepted to the Tuskegee Institute, he couldn’t afford the train ticket to get there, so he hoboed his way over on a freight line, ever on the lookout for the guards who searched for trespassers and often did violence to those they found.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During WWII, J.D. Salinger earned the rank of Staff Sergeant in the Army while participating in five campaigns, including ones which took him through D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge, and into a concentration camp. After the war, he re-upped to serve “Denazification” duty in Germany as part of the Counterintelligence Corps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ernest Hemingway learned fishing, hunting, and bushcraft skills as a toddler; worked on a farm at 15, took a weeks-long backpacking trip at 16 (subsisting on fish he caught himself), and served as an ambulance driver in WWI at age 18. As an aid worker, he earned the Italian Silver Medal for Valor for carrying a wounded soldier to safety, while being hit with gun and mortar fire twice himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these men not only undertook adventurous exploits in their youth, but continued pursuing diverse, risk-taking explorations and hobbies after they found breakthrough success in their later years as well. And though we know about their compelling backgrounds because they created culturally significant work and thus had their life stories recorded, it isn’t the case that having such interesting resumes was limited to the creative class, or to the uber successful; pick up a biography of a twentieth-century business executive or military commander, or simply the journal or personal memoir of own’s one grandfather or great-grandfather, and you’ll find that most had similarly varied and evocative experiences. They hunted, worked a farm or ranch, tried some manual labor jobs, went to sea, fought in one world war or the other, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, the situation is much the reverse. It is very rare to find an individual — whether they’re hugely successful or just an average joe — who has even a modestly interesting background, much less a McQueen-esque one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bio of a modern writer generally reads something like this instead: “So-and-so grew up in the suburbs of ____ city. He went to ____ liberal arts college and got a degree in English. Then he wrote a bestselling book.” (It is instructive to simply compare the length of the early-life/pre-career sections of the Wikipedia pages of writers/actors/musicians who came to prominence in the early-to-mid twentieth century, with those who did likewise in the late twentieth/twenty-first; the latter tend to be dramatically shorter.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average, non-Wikipedia-ized man has a similar life story, minus the public acclaim: Grew up in the suburbs; worked making sandwiches, waiting tables, and answering the phones at a call center; went to college; took an office job with some corporation; moved back to the suburbs. It’s a background that can be summarized in a few, not very compelling, words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of making this observation isn’t to cast aspersions on members of the modern generation for their comparative boring-ness. As it’s largely not our fault. For reasons both easier and more difficult to explain, the world has changed greatly over the last 50 years in ways that make it harder to have the kind of varied, adventurous experiences that men who came of age a century ago regularly did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s still technically possible to find farm or manual labor jobs, and even to (illegally) ride the rails or hitchhike across the country, guys who grew up in the suburbs typically don’t have the skills, know-how, or simply the confidence to try their hand at those kinds of pursuits, and they don’t know who to ask or where to go to even explore the possibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The expectations of family members and peers have changed as well; the “normal,” accepted thing for a young adult to do is to play it safe, stick around town, and take a job as a barista. Hemingway’s parents didn’t think anything of their teenage son heading out in the woods to live off the land; even if modern parents allowed their kid to do likewise, neighbors would probably call the Department of Children and Family Services to investigate a clear case of neglect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most transformative change in cultural expectations centers on higher education. With the exception of Paul Newman,</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> none </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the men mentioned above graduated from college; some of them dropped out of high school. Today, every young adult is expected to attend, and finish, college, and any detours that might sidetrack this trajectory, or diminish the sterling resume that’s needed for admission to a good school (particularly a criminal conviction!), are greatly discouraged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an even more concrete way, the rise of digital technology has sapped even those outlets for interesting endeavors which do remain of much of what Jack London called “the spirit of romance and adventure.” Even twenty years ago, you could backpack across Europe and be entirely unreachable for long stretches of time. “Want to get me a message? You can call me at a hotel in Budapest in three weeks.” There’s almost nowhere you can now go where you cannot be found. And this degree of interconnection not only makes adventures feel less romantic, but robs them of some of their transformative power. While problems encountered along one’s travels used to have to be navigated (literally and metaphorically) with some nervous self-reliance, uncertain improvisation, and mustered-up gumption, they can now often be resolved instantly and seamlessly with a few taps on a smartphone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then there’s the most concrete reason that courage-requiring, eventful experiences are harder to come by these days: there hasn’t been a world war in 75+ years. Today’s young men aren’t being called up to serve as a turret gunner, or a rifleman, or a counterintelligence agent, but instead grow up in a time of pervasive peace and plenty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, no, in observing the comparative dullness of the modern generation’s life stories, the intent is not to be accusative, but simply descriptive. To explain some cultural phenomena and individual feelings that many have experienced but been unable to trace or articulate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one thing, it helps put a finger on a sense of real-if-hard-to-admit deprecation and longing that many of us Millennials experience. We may not feel that the criticism over things like spending too much on avocado toast and lattes is justified, but, in quiet moments alone, we do feel a sense that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in our cohort is lacking. That feeling of lack is arguably rooted in a deficiency in “seasoning,” the kind that comes from breadth and depth of life experience, and which communicates confidence and gravitas to others, as well as to oneself. It’s a lack that’s rooted in the sense that there’s an itch amongst us that hasn’t entirely been scratched. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The above observations also explain why neither modern artists, nor the work they produce — even when excellent — feel as compelling when compared to their predecessors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though there are modern actors who have the good looks and charm of a McQueen . . .  there’s still some discernible “it” missing in their make-up. And that “it” is a personal history that includes an expansive, field-tested participation in life. With past actors, the fact that they’d seen some stuff, done some stuff, inevitably colored their personalities, and their performances. Their acting had an incomparable, and ultimately iconic, swagger, because it drew on their rich range of firsthand experiences. While the cool quotient that modern actors evince seems to stop at the surface, the coolness of older-era actors seems to run to a greater depth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, while there may be great, well-written new novels published these days, none truly feel “classic.” They don’t seem like they’re going to endure in the cultural canon the way the works of Hemingway and London have. While there may be multiple, debatable reasons as to why this is, surely one of those reasons is because the literature of the past drew more heavily on the concreteness of lived experience. If books from the twentieth century do feel weightier somehow, it’s because their authors were able to imbue their works with the pulse of real blood, sweat, and tears. Though these writers lacked university degrees in their craft, their words carry a special resonance, for they had seen death and fear up close, wrestled with nature, and made contact with multiple layers of the human condition. Modern literature, in contrast, draws more from the world of abstraction — more from what the authors </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">imagine </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the keenest dramas of the human experience would be like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In making these observations, in explaining these feelings, the message isn’t that modern men have no hope of living an interesting life. While much of the spirit of romance and adventure has passed from the earth, there is still travel to undertake, physical challenges to pursue, and worthy landscapes to explore. The message is not, not to try! How big of a difference there still is between the man who does all he can to keep pushing himself and seeking new vistas, and he who completely surrenders himself to an ordinary, staid existence! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s simply good to understand why it is that when one surveys the media of modern culture, or interacts with others, or assesses one’s own state, one often gets a peculiar sensation of emptiness; it’s simply good to understand why it is that when one goes looking in such spaces and places, one so frequently comes away with a feeling of disappointment — the sinking realization that, alas, there’s nothing there, there. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-least-interesting-generation/\">The Least Interesting Generation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/xGtm3-qllwg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 16:04:00 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9e3076f6bb6186df06394989ed6828f7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/Least-interesting-Header-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn52@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-49-256_907372c793c63e2c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/xGtm3-qllwg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-31-225_f99d60e5059dad0d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916060},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"What’s the Right Age to Get a Kid Their First Smartphone? 3 Tech Thinkers Weigh In","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=137490","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-137496\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/kids_smartphone_header2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/kids_smartphone_header2.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/kids_smartphone_header2-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/kids_smartphone_header2-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/kids_smartphone_header2-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents have long had to figure out when to let their kids pass through certain “firsts” and milestones as they grow up. First time walking to the bus stop by themselves. First time riding their bike to a convenience store on their own. Getting a job. Getting a driver’s license.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In each case, the parent must decide whether in granting a new privilege, the child is ready to take on the responsibility that goes with it. They must weigh whether the risks that are attendant to the new freedom are worth the benefits the child will gain. With the exception of getting a driver’s license, no external entities set a definitive age for when an appropriate balance of these factors is typically reached. Parents just have to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/practical-wisdom/\">use their practical wisdom</a>, and wing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The improvised nature of these kinds of decisions is particularly acute when it comes to dealing with an issue that didn’t even exist when many of today’s parents were growing up: when a kid should get their first smartphone.</span></p>\n<h3>What’s the Right Age to Get a Kid Their First Smartphone?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When to allow a young adult to get their first smartphone is a fraught question. On the one hand, there is research that links the amount of time a person spends online with higher rates of depression and anxiety, and every adult knows how much distraction their own phones create — and they’re not even as socially attuned and connected as their kids! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, having a smartphone can be crucial for allowing young adults to socialize with their friends these days (and for facilitating schoolwork and extracurriculars as well). Cutting them off from those opportunities to integrate with their peers may cause the very depression a smartphone-withholding parent is trying to prevent.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average age at which a child gets their own smartphone these days is ten. But is that actually a good age for parents to introduce this kind of powerful technology into their children’s lives? </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> there a best age to introduce a smartphone that allows kids to take advantage of its connection-building benefits, while mitigating its potentially negative effects?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While answering this question isn’t a science, we wondered how folks who have spent a ton of time thinking about the impact that digital technology has had on human minds and culture would weigh in on it. (Bill Gates, for one, didn’t allow his three children to have smartphones until each was 14 years old). We thus reached out to three tech thinkers to see what they had to say:</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Dr. Larry D. Rosen</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a professor emeritus of psychology, and the co-author of </span></i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qT8gE6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World</span></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can listen to our podcast interview with his co-author on that book, Adam Gazzaley, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-beat-distraction-and-stay-focused/\">here</a>.</span></i></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">used to say that 12 or so was the magic age when kids discovered social media and communicated virtually with their friends. Now, however, with the pandemic as well as the increasing use by preteens, </span><b>I say that 10 or 11 is fine</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if the child is missing out on socializing.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I am adamantly opposed to just giving a child a phone with no limits or boundaries. It should be clear from the start that the phone belongs to the parents and that the child gets the privilege of using it as long as it is used appropriately. This means lots of discussion between parents and the child to find those boundaries. One clear boundary is no phone before homework is done. Another is setting a time limit on phone use and only allowing adding new apps with the parent’s permission.” </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Dr. Adam Alter</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a professor of marketing and psychology and the author of </span></i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dONMa3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked</span></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can listen to our podcast interview with Adam about </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irresistible</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-420-what-makes-your-phone-so-addictive-how-to-take-back-your-life/\">here</a>. </span></i></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The sweet spot is allowing your kids to use screens as late as possible — but not so late that your decision to withhold puts them in a difficult position socially. It’s a tough line to walk. I don’t think there’s a single age that works equally well for everyone, but I wouldn’t let my kids use screens until they’re old enough to have a reasoned conversation about the major issues: when and how much screen time is appropriate; why we don’t use screens without limits; what to watch out for (bullying, abuse, etc.); which platforms are okay and which ones aren’t (which should obviously evolve as kids age. </span><b>I don’t think many kids are mature enough to handle the stresses of screens until their mid-teens</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, though very few kids start using social media platforms that late.”</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Cal Newport </i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a computer science professor and the author of seven books, including </span></i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hm02RC\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</span></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can listen to our podcast interview with Cal about </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital Minimalism</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/digital-minimalism-cal-newport/\">here</a>. </span></i></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><b>I lean toward waiting until at least 16 years old</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to give teenagers unrestricted access to smartphones. In the interim, feature phones can be used to support their ability to text with family and friends. The evidence around the harmful effects of giving a hyper-social and volatile adolescent brain unrestricted access to brain hacking services like social media and video games is worrisome. In most cases, it’s easier to work on solving the social issues surrounding having no smartphone at that age than it is to solve the issues caused by having one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s often said in these kinds of discussions that there isn’t a “right” age for a kid to get their first smartphone, that it will depend more on the kid’s individual level of maturity than a set chronological number. And while that may be true for landing on a gradient within a range, we’d argue it isn’t true for setting a minimum age. Parents should have an idea of a hard line before which they will not allow their children’s minds and lives (and the life of the family as a whole) to dramatically change. Because, make no mistake about it, the introduction of a smartphone into your child’s life </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> greatly alter it. Their head will be increasingly buried in their phone, with less of it facing towards you and the outside world in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So while no writer or professor can tell you the right age to introduce a smartphone to your child, all would be well served to keep the caveats and considerations that were raised above in mind: Start with a “dumbphone” that only allows for things like calls and texts, and see how your kid handles it. When you do let them segue to a smartphone, have thoughtful conversations about the lifelong repercussions of what they share online (“Never share anything you wouldn’t want broadcast to the entire world”). Be emphatic about the importance of balancing digital communication with the in-person kind, demonstrating the value of face-to-face interactions both in your words, and even more importantly, in your example. Set clear boundaries for when your child can (after homework is done) and can’t (at the dinner table) use their phone. Some parents even draw up more formal “contracts” delineating such guidelines (and the consequences for violating them). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get a driver’s license, the law sets a minimum age and requirements which include taking classes that involve both “book work” and hands-on instruction; often, the adolescent must first obtain a “learner’s permit,” which sets limitations on when and how they can drive, and requires an experienced driver to ride along in the passenger seat. While operating a vehicle does come with serious physical dangers, using a smartphone carries its own set of pitfalls. As such, earning the privilege of the latter milestone, should be premised on completing just as much education and mentoring as the former.</span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/when-to-give-kid-smartphone/\">What’s the Right Age to Get a Kid Their First Smartphone? 3 Tech Thinkers Weigh In</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/41g4c7l0j84\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 16:07:18 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"46b0a79e01ee17e946066cda7b185d97","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/07/kids_smartphone_header2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn76@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-32-522_d7d5614fd241c3de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/41g4c7l0j84":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn72@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-31-120_d351a8e31b760f69.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916062},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"Podcast #721: The Psychology of Effective Weight Loss","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=137480","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Psychology of Effective Weight Loss\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/the-psychology-of-effective-weight-loss/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><br></br>\nWhen most people think about losing weight, they think about the details of a diet plan — what food to eat, how much of it to eat, and when to eat it. What they don’t spend enough time working on, are the mental and emotional habits that can sabotage their efforts, regardless of the diet plan they adopt.</p>\n<p>That’s why my guest today, despite being a biochemist, has made <i>mindset </i>the foundation of his approach to losing weight. His name is Dr. Trevor <span class=\"il\">Kashey</span> and he’s the founder of <a href=\"https://www.trevorkasheynutrition.com/\">Trevor <span class=\"il\">Kashey</span> Nutrition</a> (TKN). We begin our conversation with a thumbnail of Trevor’s unique background, which includes earning his first university degree in biochemistry at the age of 17, setting national records in powerlifting, and coaching an Olympic fight team, as well as how he went from coaching elite athletes to helping average folks lose weight. We then talk about why Trevor focuses on bridging the gap between knowledge and action, and the erroneous assumptions people make that keep them from following through on their intentions. From there we turn to the phases TKN takes its clients through, which begins with getting what Trevor calls “food clarity.” We discuss how simply tracking what you eat can get you to naturally change your diet because of something called “the Hawthorne effect,” and can almost be all you need to do to start losing weight. We then get into how to deal with your hunger when you’re cutting calories, and why it’s crucial to be decisive about it. We also discuss how you can eventually eat more once you work on eating less, how to manage the expectation of consistent weight loss, and why you really need to weigh yourself every week.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-708-overcoming-the-comfort-crisis/\">AoM podcast episode with Michael Easter on <em>The Comfort Crisis</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/most-sustainable-diet/\">AoM podcast episode on what makes for a sustainable diet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off/\">AoM podcast episode on how to keep off the weight you lose</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-track-macros/\">How to track your food intake</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/6-ways-to-measure-your-body-fat/\">6 ways to measure your body fat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect\">The Hawthorne effect</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/willpower/\">AoM series on willpower</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Connect With Dr. Trevor Kashey</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trevorkasheynutrition.com\">Trevor Kashey Nutrition: TKN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drkashey/?hl=en\">Trevor on Instagram</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheBESTNutritionGroupEVER/\">The Best Nutrition Group EVER on FB</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Listen to the Podcast!
