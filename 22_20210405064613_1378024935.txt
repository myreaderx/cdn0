In August, the US provided the kingdom with <a href=\"https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-receives-around-700-million-us-grant\">$700 million in aid</a>.</p><p>On Saturday, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Major General Yousef Huneiti, denied reports that Prince Hamza had been arrested. He added that he had been ordered to &#34;stop activities that are being exploited to target Jordan&#39;s security and stability.&#34;</p><p>Prince Hamza has denied the allegations, telling the BBC he was &#34;not part of any conspiracy,&#34; in a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56626370\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to video\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">video</a> provided by his lawyer.</p><p>&#34;There is no conspiracy here. Whatever concoction they&#39;re attempting to create or whatever narrative that they&#39;re attempting to sell, the basic fact is that this is all about human dignity here, freedom from arbitrary government, freedom from invasive security apparatuses and services...&#34; he said in the video.</p><p>In 2004, King Abdullah II dismissed Prince Hamza as heir, opting for his eldest son, Hussein, and consolidating his power.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and other Arab states expressed support for King Abdullah, Bloomberg reported.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Noor Al Hussein  (@QueenNoor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1378639005164707840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The US has also vocalized support.

Brian Kemp, a Republican, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-lawmakers-pass-sweeping-election-administration-bill-2021-3\">signed the sweeping elections bill</a> into law on March 25, which has been met with backlash from Democrats and civil-rights groups who say it targets Black communities. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-new-election-law-means-for-voters-and-officials-explainer-2021-3\">Among the most controversial aspects</a> of the bill are changes to absentee voting and banning volunteers from delivering food, water, and other items to people waiting in long voting lines.</p><p>Murphy wrote that &#34;restricting the right to vote is more than just wrong, it&#39;s un-American&#34; and that the &#34;vast majority&#34; see the law as &#34;an attack on people of color by a Governor and Legislature willing to do anything to stay in power.&#34;</p><p>Georgia offers attractive tax incentives that have made it a major Hollywood production hub.

We believe that all Americans should enjoy equitable access to secure elections and we have long supported and promoted voter education, registration and participation campaigns across the country to achieve that goal. Efforts to limit or impede access to this vital constitutional right for any citizen are not consistent with our values.&#34;</p><p>AT&#38;T&#39;s CEO John Stankey said in part: &#34;We believe the right to vote is sacred and we support voting laws that make it easier for more Americans to vote in free, fair and secure elections. We understand that election laws are complicated, not our company&#39;s expertise and ultimately the responsibility of elected officials. But, as a company, we have a responsibility to engage.&#34;</p><p>Disney and Netflix have not released statements regarding the Georgia voting law.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

The innermost chunks of ice and rock shoot through space at about 52,000 mph (23.2 kilometers per second).</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/605e021c106eb50019d05d1a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"saturn rings illustration\" height=\"1440\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An illustration of Saturn&#39;s rings up close.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details-0400741\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Up close, Saturn&#39;s rings aren&#39;t as chaotic as their speeds might make them seem. According to O&#39;Donoghue, grains of ice on neighboring tracks are only moving at a few centimeters per minute relative to each other.</p><p>&#34;That speed is like walking one step every 30 minutes, or similar to rush hour traffic,&#34; he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/physicsJ/status/1272133243165270023\">said</a> on Twitter. &#34;So collisions aren&#39;t very dramatic.&#34;</p><h2>Saturn is slowly swallowing its rings</h2><p>In addition to being incredibly fast-moving, Saturn&#39;s rings are very long and thin. If you unfurled them - as O&#39;Donoghue did in the image below - all the planets would fit comfortably within their length.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/605e01266746fb0018a73eb8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"saturn rings solar system o&#39;donoghue\" height=\"2048\" width=\"4096\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">James O&#39;Donoghue</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>But in total, the rings have just 1/5,000th the mass of our moon.</p><p>&#34;In other words, our moon could be used to make 5,000 Saturn ring systems,&#34; O&#39;Donoghue told Insider. &#34;This highlights how extremely thin and fragile the rings of Saturn are.&#34;</p><p>This fragility is a subject of O&#39;Donoghue&#39;s scientific research. In studying Saturn&#39;s upper atmosphere, he and his colleagues <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2018/ring-rain\">found</a> that the rings are slowly disappearing. Thousands of kilograms of ring material rain onto the planet every second. At that rate, the rings shouldn&#39;t last more than 300 million years in their current &#34;full&#34; form, he said.</p><p>&#34;Saturn&#39;s ring system is not exactly stable, appearing to be more like a temporary debris field of some ancient moon or comet which got too close and broke apart, rather than a permanent feature,&#34; O&#39;Donoghue added. &#34;We can count ourselves lucky we live in a time when Saturn&#39;s rings have such an enormous presence in the solar system.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

companies overall to post a 6% increase in bottom-up per-share earnings, according to FactSet. A 6% rise would represent the largest increase since the financial-data firm began tracking the earnings estimate in the second quarter of 2002. Earnings, on average, are currently expected to come in at $39.86 per share.</p><p>The bottom-up EPS estimate is an aggregation of the median first-quarter earnings-per-share estimates for all of the companies in the S&#38;P 500, FactSet said in a note published Thursday.</p><p>The projected 6% increase stands out in part because a bottom-up EPS estimate usually decreases during a quarter. FactSet said during the past five years, the estimate has recorded a decline of 4.2% during a quarter, and during the past 15 years, it has tended to post a decrease of 5.1%.</p><p>Analysts &#34;may have been too aggressive in their downward revisions to EPS estimates during the first half of 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns,&#34; wrote John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet, in looking at the factors behind the boost in first-quarter projections.</p><p>The global economy sunk into recession last year as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses worldwide to close or reduce operations to curb the spread of the respiratory disease. The US economy contracted by 33% in the second quarter of 2020.</p><p>But analysts in the third quarter of 2020 began raising their earnings expectations for that quarter and beyond.

Oil prices have jumped by more than 20% to top $59 a barrel during the first quarter and the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/rates/u-s--rates-10-years\">yield on the 10-year Treasury note</a> quickly scaled up above 1.7% during the first three months of this year from 0.92%. </p><p>The highest percentage increases in bottom-up EPS estimates are for the energy, materials, and financials sectors as they are &#34;likely benefitting from either higher commodity prices (Energy and Materials) or higher interest rates (Financials),&#34; said Butters.</p><p>Per-share earnings estimates for the energy sector have shot up by 123%, to $2.55 from $1.14, the largest boost in projections among the 11 sectors tracked on the S&#38;P 500 index. The financial sector is forecast to post a collective earnings increase of about 13% for the first quarter.</p><p>&#34;Finally, companies in the S&#38;P 500 have been much more optimistic in their EPS guidance than normal,&#34; said Butters, noting that 61 companies have issued positive first-quarter guidance, well above the five-year average of 35.</p><p>&#34;If 61 is the final number for the quarter, it will mark the highest number of S&#38;P 500 companies issuing positive EPS guidance for a quarter since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2006,&#34;

and that his mental health issues may have stemmed from hits to the head that he suffered while playing football. </p><p>Green, 25, spent years playing the game and was a defensive back when he attended college at Christopher Newport University in Virginia. </p><p>The attack happened last Friday when Green, allegedly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-capitol-is-on-lockdown-over-an-external-security-threat-2021-4\">rammed a car into two police officers at a barricade outside the US Capitol</a>.

I looked up to you when I was a kid. You inspired me a lot.&#34;</p><p>The Post also reported that Green&#39;s family said they were  &#34;very shocked and upset&#34; by the attack, and &#34;just as taken aback as the rest of the nation from this horrific event.&#34; </p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-politics-451c5c5154045d404d0db76270f78aac\">AP</a>, the investigation into the Capitol attack is now focusing largely on Green&#39;s mental health to determine a motive. Officials speaking anonymously to the AP said Green had been suffering from &#34;increasingly delusional thoughts,&#34; suicidal ideation, and paranoia. </p><p>The AP reported as well that Green had written in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-removes-account-capitol-attack-suspect-noah-green-2021-4\">now-removed online posts</a> that he thought he was being surveilled and put under a government thought-control program. </p><p>Green described himself as a follower of the &#34;Nation of Islam&#34; and American religious leader Louis Farrakhan. </p><p>&#34;To be honest these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher,&#34; Green wrote in the posts, referencing the trying times he went through when he turned to his newfound faith.</p><p>&#34;I have been tried with some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life.

Facebook has since removed Green&#39;s Instagram and Facebook accounts, but CNN reported he repeatedly posted that he suspected the government was using &#34;mind control&#34; on him, and that he was suffering several afflictions &#34;presumably by the CIA and FBI, government agencies of the United States of America.&#34; </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

reviewing the I-45 widening project, mentioning Houston-area Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Air Alliance Houston, and the community organization Texas Housers.</p><p>&#34;I think

administration, told Politico that taking such a step was a big change.</p><p>&#34;It just doesn&#39;t happen very often,&#34; he said. &#34;For DOT to step in, potentially, and say &#39;We don&#39;t

neglect,&#34; he said <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/08/biden-buttigieg-acial-equity-473928\">in a Politico interview</a> last month. &#34;We&#39;re talking about some really

digital banking needs.</li>\n<li>Over the next year, Beer says, there will be increased demand for personalization, automation, and real-time payments.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The last year changed all industries, including banking.</p><p>Consumers have embraced digital banking tools for several years, but the pandemic accelerated adoption even further across demographics. For example, half of Chase&#39;s new digitally active customers since March 2020 are over 50.  </p><p>New research suggests that we can expect consumers to engage more actively with their bank&#39;s digital offerings in 2021 and beyond. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/technology/2020-digital-banking-survey\">Chase survey</a>, 80% of respondents prefer to manage their finances digitally rather than in-person.</p><p>We believe this preference will continue to increase demand for personalization, automation and real-time payments as consumers continue to shy away from cash. </p><h2><strong>Personalization</strong></h2><p>Every year, tech companies release new devices, hardware and software that allow consumers to update and personalize their experience. Consumers want the same experience from their bank.</p><p>Banking will become even more personalized in 2021, helping foster deeper engagement between customers and the features and services that their bank offers. </p><p>Advanced technologies - like artificial intelligence - can help banks create more customized experiences that adapt to each customer&#39;s individual needs. For example, people can already use their mobile banking app to enjoy offers and rewards from some of their favorite retailers and brands. Customers can also view unique insights about their spending and savings trends or credit score to make more informed financial decisions. </p><h2><strong>Automation</strong></h2><p>In a post-vaccine world, consumers will still want to find the most convenient and effective ways to manage their finances. We expect digital resources that assist with budgeting and bill payments to play a major role in future digital banking enhancements.</p><p>Automation, especially for payments and savings, has made it effortless for consumers to stay on top of their finances. Essentially, they increasingly want to use their mobile apps to &#34;set it and forget it.&#34; Moving forward, we anticipate that we will make an even wider array of automated tools available. </p><h2><strong>Real-time</strong></h2><p>Digital payments became even more popular last year, as consumers relied on safe, convenient and contactless methods for completing real-time peer to peer (P2P) payments. In fact, in 2020, the Zelle Network processed more than <a href=\"https://www.zellepay.com/press-releases/zeller-closes-2020-record-307-billion-sent-12-billion-transactions\">1.2 billion transactions</a> totaling $307 billion in payments. Consumers and businesses can easily process transactions using a variety of real-time payment platforms - whether they are paying rent, splitting a dinner bill, or paying the babysitter.</p><p>The early adopters of this technology were younger generations, but in 2020 we saw older customers use this way of paying more frequently. Real-time payments will undoubtedly grow in popularity as both consumers and businesses become more comfortable with the convenience and security it provides. </p><p>Digital banking will further influence who consumers choose to bank with. COVID-19 has increased customer preference for the convenience and speed that digital banking offers through websites and apps. To better serve consumers of all ages, banks will need to be agile enough to react quickly to the evolving needs of their customers.</p><p>At the end of the day, who consumers choose to bank with will increasingly depend on how easy it is for them to manage their entire financial life digitally from one place. Banks that make that experience seamless, insightful and simple will gain loyal customers who engage more frequently with their products and services.</p><p><a href=\"https://media.chase.com/leadership/gordon-smith/allison-beer\"><em>Allison Beer</em></a><em> is chief product officer and head of customer experience and digital for Chase.

Mayor Michael Tubbs, the first Black mayor elected to office at the ripe age of  26, is running a guaranteed income pilot. He makes the case that poverty comes from a lack of cash, not a lack of character.</p><p>We knew providing a stable income was important pre-pandemic, but post-pandemic it is a lifeline for Stockton families. Guaranteed income helps these families weather the crisis with more resilience than their neighbors.</p><p>I can&#39;t help but imagine how this approach could have helped millions more if it had been part of our economic approach across the country. What would it mean to have this kind of an economic floor?</p><p>Named the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), the program gives 125 families in Stockton an income floor of $500 a month for 18 months. The income is unconditional. This means there are no strings attached and no work requirements.</p><p>Stockton is a city in the process of reinventing itself, with no shortage of challenges. It was the largest city to go bankrupt after the last financial crisis. It&#39;s a city that is representative of America, with a majority of the population being people of color. One in four Stocktonians live in poverty; the median income is around $44,000.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6054bd5a1fcb5700186ee62b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"book 553x677\" height=\"677\" width=\"553\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The New Possible anthology.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Natalie Foster et al</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The families participating in the guaranteed income pilot provide compelling data for how cash transfers allow families to remain resilient in the face of a pandemic. In these families, we see how no-strings-attached cash provides a way forward in economic uncertainty.</p><p>That resilience is the promise of the SEED project in particular, and the promise of guaranteed income more broadly.</p><h2>To see the impact on people&#39;s lives, let&#39;s look at one recipient&#39;s story.</h2><p>For Tomas, the outbreak happened as he was getting his security clearance for a job at the airport. As with many companies, the pandemic caused a hiring freeze and halted the application process at the airport.</p><p>Suddenly finding himself out of work and without any jobless benefits, the guaranteed income became Tomas&#39; sole financial fallback.</p><p>Tomas can&#39;t live on $500 or even $1,000 a month, but the guaranteed income is not meant to be an income on its own. It supports resilience. It works to stabilize the erratic ups and downs and to help people through difficult times in times of widespread destabilization. This is something we should all have, and our current political and economic moment makes it a possibility. We can make this kind of economic care and resilience part of our reality in the wake of COVID-19.</p><p>We are often asked, &#34;What do people spend the money on?&#34; The answer: People spend the money on food, general supplies, and utilities. But wanting to know exactly where the money goes misses the point. A more interesting question is: &#34;What does the money do?&#34; The evidence shows that meaningful psychological and emotional gains are embedded in providing people with the resources to take care of their basic needs.</p><p>Researchers Dr. Amy Castro Baker and Dr. Stacia West, who are independently evaluating the Stockton program, understand this point. Beyond tracking the basics of where the money goes, they are evaluating questions of wellbeing, including stress levels, hope, and feelings of belonging. The two researchers define hope in the way that they ask the question: &#34;Do you want to wake up in the morning?&#34; Hope is about goals, pathways, and agency. As Dr. Castro Baker puts it, &#34;Keep in mind - the opposite of hope is despair. Understanding how economic security is linked to hope is key. Many would argue that change and justice are simply not possible without hope.&#34;</p><p>They also ask interviewees, &#34;Do you feel seen? Do you feel seen as a human being by institutions with power over your life?&#34; If you don&#39;t feel like you matter as a human, your capacity for hope is limited. Hope is one of the most significant predictors of whether or not you will engage with positive and healthy interventions when capitalism has already spit you out, or when it has communicated to you that you do not serve a purpose.</p><p>According to Dr. Castro Baker, &#34;Hope is about saying: To what degree can a justice-based intervention such as a guaranteed income serve as a financial vaccine in a prolonged stressful environment with an unknown end?&#34;</p><p>Early trends indicate that, with just $500 cash a month, people can move the needle on both hope and belonging. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6069c545856cd700198a3135?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Natalie Foster\" height=\"1345\" width=\"1794\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Natalie Foster.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tyler Driscoll</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Better Ideas Aren&#39;t Necessarily New Ideas</h2><p>It has been heartening to see guaranteed income percolate into Stockton society as a possible response to the pandemic and the treacherous economic insecurity experienced by so many Americans. Giving people cash works. I</p><p>t&#39;s not a new idea; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. also spoke and wrote extensively on the power of a guaranteed income. He was pushed in his thinking by activists such as Johnnie Tillmon, who played a critical role in the National Welfare Rights Organization.</p><p>Nearly 50 years ago Johnnie Tillmon, a welfare rights advocate, wrote, &#34;The truth is, a job doesn&#39;t necessarily mean an adequate income. There are some ten million jobs that now pay less than the minimum wage, and if you&#39;re a woman, you&#39;ve got the best chance of getting one.&#34;  Tillmon&#39;s words are still true today. </p><p>As a result of the pandemic, more and more Americans experience low wages, income insecurity, degrading interactions with benefits offices, and lack of protections. While these have been the consistent experience of many Black Americans, the blacklight is exposing others to this harsh reality as well. The extraordinary economic disruption is now moving beyond the segregated zip codes, where it has lingered untended for far too long.</p><p>While the impacts of the coronavirus mean that more people now experience economic inequality, people of color have been advocating for economic justice for decades. We now have an opportunity and a responsibility to advance new rules with old roots in a meaningful way right now.</p><p>Even in a short amount of time, we&#39;ve made tremendous strides. When I cofounded the Economic Security Project, guaranteed income struck people as a far-fetched idea and even a pipe dream. But that just isn&#39;t the case anymore.</p><p>The uncomfortable truth is that there will be future pandemics - whether they are the result of climate change, job automation, or something entirely unforeseen. We will find ourselves here again. But let&#39;s make sure that, when that day comes, the economic realities of American families are in a very different place. Right now, we can begin to offer the economic resilience required to weather these changes and the turmoil they bring.</p><p>As a nation, there is still much reckoning to be done. But we can&#39;t be an anti-racist, just society until we have safe and stable families and communities. And for this we need cash. Let&#39;s first provide a guaranteed income to stabilize every family. Then we can get to the hard work of healing this nation together.</p><p><em>This excerpt is adapted from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Possible-Visions-beyond-Crisis-ebook/dp/B08KFSNG1Q\">The

Stock investors who&#39;ve seen a roughly 10% annual return from recent decades should expect that gain to go down to 3% to 5% over the course of the 2020s, he added.</p><p>But he has a recommendation: Real assets are a more overlooked part of the market that may offer investors protection against inflation while diversifying their portfolios.</p><p>In a recent note Hartnett said that real estate, commodities, and even collectibles like wine, art, diamonds, and cars could outperform in the next decade. Investors don&#39;t need to own the physical assets, Hartnett added, but instead can own REITs, and specialized funds that focus on these assets. </p><p>Real assets are positively correlated with inflation and interest rates, unlike financial assets like stocks and bonds, Hartnett said.

He added that in eras where bonds and stocks struggle, real assets have provided superior risk-adjusted returns.</p><p>Over the past 5 and 10 years as inflation fell to the lowest average levels since the 1960s, real assets have seen lower returns and lower volatility, according to BofA data. Now, the price of real assets relative to financial assets are at the lowest point since 1925, making them attractive investments according to Hartnett.</p><p>Real assets are also underowned, with only 5.5% of the total market cap of all ETFs exposed to real assets. </p><p>Additionally, since 1926, collectibles (8.1%) and commodities (6.3%) have offered higher returns than government bonds (6.0%) and cash (3.4%), albeit with higher volatility.</p><p>Bank of America suggested investors seek out funds like the Fine Art Group, Classic Car Fund, and the London International Vintners Exchange Fine Wine Fund Index (FWIFFWID), in addition to REITs and commodity funds if they&#39;re looking for real asset exposure.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a

Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepCawthorn/status/1376974227753070593\">pointed to health funding</a> in his district in a tweet last week, including nearly $2.5 million for the Appalachian Mountain Community Health Centers and $4.6 million for Western North Carolina Community Health Services that was part of the legislation.</p><p>&#34;Happy to announce that NC-11 was awarded grants from the U.S. Department of Health &#38; Human Services,&#34; he wrote. &#34;Proud to see tax-payer dollars returned to NC-11.&#34;</p><p>Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harrisonjaime/status/1377014594267398145\">took note</a> of Hawthorn&#39;s tweet and blasted the congressman and the GOP.</p><p>&#34;Come&#39;on man,&#34; he wrote. &#34;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepCawthorn\" data-focusable=\"true\">@RepCawthorn</a> is trying to take credit for the grants HE VOTED AGAINST.

Roger Wicker of Mississippi <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wicker-praises-covid-19-relief-funding-after-voting-against-bill-2021-3\">praised</a> the billions in targeted funding for the restaurant industry that he championed - it was part the final package that he voted against.</p><p>&#34;Independent restaurant operators have won $28.6 billion worth of targeted relief,&#34; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorWicker/status/1369770036982915084\">he tweeted</a> after the bill passed. &#34;This funding will ensure small businesses can survive the pandemic by helping to adapt their operations and keep their employees on the payroll.&#34;</p><p>When asked by CNN&#39;s Manu Raju why he didn&#39;t support the full measure, Wicker said he didn&#39;t have to accept the full measure and was critical of the questioning.</p><p>&#34;Just because there&#39;s one good provision in a $1.9 trillion bill, doesn&#39;t mean I have to vote for it ...

As Christians, we need to ask ourselves, if you have this faith of loving your neighbors, in what spaces does your faith show up?&#39;&#34;</p><p>The librarian said her workshops had been received well by many churchgoers, who vary in age and race.

Douglas told Insider. &#34;It&#39;s a small step from disputing the science of evolution and climate change to doubting the efficacy of masks and vaccines in fighting the pandemic because it all comes from a common source, which is mainstream &#39;secular&#39; science.&#34;</p><p>Douglas believes 2020&#39;s pandemic and election exacerbated this problem as many feel like their political opponents are trying to &#34;destroy Christian America and to take away what they call their &#39;religious freedoms.&#39;&#34;<u></u><u></u></p><p>This is why Christian churches need training like Wightman&#39;s, Douglas said. &#34;Public institutions like libraries, colleges, and universities all have a role to play in developing critical thinking and critical media literacy skills,&#34; he said.</p><p>Even though Wightman is balancing her new work with a full-time job, she said she&#39;s proud of what she&#39;s accomplished so far and hopes to continue doing more workshops in the future.</p><p>&#34;A lot of people think librarians just sit around and read all day, so it&#39;s been fun to bust that myth open a bit,&#34; said Wightman. &#34;We&#39;re teachers, we&#39;re about connecting people with information, and so be able to do that in a new way that feels so relevant is very exciting.&#34; </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/christians-are-often-victims-of-conspiracy-theories-health-falsehoods-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/bPxQLhYGcoo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 09:50:41 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60658f7edaf0f10018f99657?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"e4d995aa3f1ef16dce86880f45f3eade","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-46-04-023_e8d91cc71ea68639.webp","destWidth":4864,"destHeight":3648,"sourceBytes":1786764,"destBytes":1786764,"author":"sankel@businessinsider.com (Sophia Ankel)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60659020daf0f10018f99658?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn70@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-05-030_8d832de8764544a3.webp","https://i.insider.com/606590b56183e10019819ad9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn10@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-46-10-858_ee0f3aac5cb5a945.webp","https://i.insider.com/604d0a6110c8760018b93198?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn90@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-46-07-952_76d0d3222df25127.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-09-303_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn81@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-46-08-870_1ecd489b898dadf9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn70@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-08-104_cf1df0ac26bb7a2f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-46-06-748_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=bPxQLhYGcoo:XCFzQxqHnDU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn21@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-10-817_803063e89322ebe4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/bPxQLhYGcoo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn86@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-08-529_267dca8b07b9d903.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605114906},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","title":"Fertility experts debunk 19 myths about getting pregnant and fertility","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/fertility-experts-debunk-19-fertility-pregnancy-myths-2021-3","description":"<div style=\"position:relative;

Pineapple by itself, if you have infertility, is unlikely to reverse your infertility.</p><p>I&#39;m Dr. Cindy. I am a fertility specialist based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Hello,</p><p><strong>Eleswarapu: </strong>I&#39;m Dr. Sriram Eleswarapu, and I&#39;m a urologist at UCLA. And today we&#39;ll be debunking myths about infertility.</p><p><strong>Duke:</strong> &#34;Tight underwear is bad for sperm count.&#34;</p><p><strong>Eleswarapu: </strong>So, there&#39;ve been a number of studies looking at this issue for many decades, and the inevitable question is boxers versus briefs. In truth, it doesn&#39;t matter a whole lot, and we know that if the testicles are a little bit warmer that they are more at risk of having sperm-count issues or sperm-motility issues, but, in general, it shouldn&#39;t matter too much. Just pick what&#39;s comfortable.</p><p><strong>Duke: </strong>&#34;Sex position matters.&#34;</p><p><strong>Eleswarapu: </strong>So, that is a myth. No matter what position you engage in, if you ejaculate, you have the sufficient propulsion of the semen to make it up to the cervix, any way you do it.</p><p><strong>Duke: </strong>People around the world have actually studied it, and no one position has been proven to be better than another.</p><p><strong>Eleswarapu: </strong>&#34;IVF guarantees pregnancy.&#34;</p><p><strong>Duke: </strong>Oh, boy. Yes, that is definitely a myth. And it&#39;s a tough myth for patients to hear. IVF does present the highest chances of pregnancy, absolutely. There are a number of factors that play into IVF success. One of them has to do with the age of the eggs being used. It also has to do with the quality of the sperm and the egg when they come together. It has to do with the embryo that is ultimately formed. It also has to do with the genetics of the embryo. But then, on top of that, it has to do with the womb in which the embryo will be placed, and a number of factors are not yet fully known. So, we know the immune system plays a role. Diet, exercise probably play a role, but we&#39;re still investigating that. Biggest thing to know is it&#39;s not 100%.</p><p><strong>Eleswarapu: </strong>&#34;Stress causes miscarriages.&#34;</p><p>I think we&#39;re starting to get away from the term &#34;miscarriages.&#34; We&#39;re starting to use the term &#34;early pregnancy loss.&#34; Is that right?</p><p><strong>Duke: </strong>That&#39;s correct. And I think it&#39;s because &#34;miscarriage&#34; also comes with certain connotations where blame is also ascribed, and the truth is, both early pregnancy losses, there&#39;s nothing the individual could have done about it at all. So now we call it early pregnancy loss before the end of the first trimester, versus second- and third-trimester pregnancy loss. We do not believe stress causes loss. Many people around the world across millennia have gotten pregnant and remain pregnant despite tremendous stress. So we know it&#39;s not simply stress. Nowadays, though, we know the No. 1 reason for pregnancy loss is chromosomal differences in the formed embryo. And so that&#39;s called aneuploidy. 67% of first-trimester pregnancy losses are due to chromosomal issues within the embryo itself. Other reasons would be if the thyroid was not functioning well, if vitamin D is low, if there&#39;s a fibroid in the uterus. If you have a uterus and you&#39;ve had two or more pregnancy losses, you should be evaluated. We always expected that it would be the individual with the womb and the eggs to be the one that gets evaluated for a pregnancy loss. Now the tide is shifting, and individuals who contribute the sperm are also being evaluated when there&#39;s a pregnancy loss in the couple. There&#39;s emerging data that things like DNA fragmentation, where the DNA that are normally supposed to be very tightly wrapped up in the sperm are somehow unraveled and might have little breaks in the DNA strands, and those breaks can contribute to the pregnancy loss.</p><p>&#34;Freezing your eggs guarantees that you can have kids later.&#34;</p><p>Myth. And the myth is in the word &#34;guaranteed.&#34; If you freeze your eggs, you can stop the clock. And so you&#39;re basically freezing the youngest version of yourself at that point. However, there&#39;s no guarantee that eggs even when frozen will thaw and yield a live-born baby. So it&#39;s really a conversation that needs to happen with your specialist based on your age, based on your egg number.</p><p>&#34;Sperm quality doesn&#39;t decline with age.&#34;</p><p><strong>Eleswarapu: </strong>There&#39;s a lot of data now that is showing that individuals with sperm that is older, say in the fifth, sixth, seventh decades of life and beyond, is more at risk of forming embryos that have chromosomal abnormalities. Getting exercise, eating well are things that can improve the general biology of an individual. Certainly if it&#39;s good for the heart and it&#39;s good for the brain, then it&#39;s probably good for the penis and the scrotum and the testicles as well. We talked about egg freezing, but sperm freezing has its role particularly for individuals who may not be in a relationship or may not be thinking of a family at this time but later on down the road they might want to produce a family.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s impossible to get pregnant after 35.&#34;</p><p><strong>Duke: </strong>It is possible to get pregnant after 35. The truth is, though, that the chance of pregnancy progressively declines as the age of the egg increases. And so you might find greater and greater need for fertility treatments. When you&#39;re born, if you&#39;re someone born with ovaries, you&#39;d have somewhere between 1 million to 2 million eggs in those ovaries, usually. By age 30, 70% of those eggs are gone, and by age 40, 97% of those eggs are gone. At the same time, those eggs are also aging. And so what we see is that the chance of pregnancy declines very quickly, and then for some people it declines even faster. So if you have endometriosis, if you&#39;re someone who&#39;s maybe had surgeries of the ovaries or needed to be on medications, chemotherapy, radiation, all of those things can also further the decline in the egg number. So my recommendation is, if you have ovaries, at age 30, you should at least be asking your doctor to do a check of your egg number, or what&#39;s called your ovarian reserve.</p><p>&#34;The best way to get pregnant is to have sex every day.&#34;</p><p><strong>Eleswarapu: </strong>It comes down to the ovulatory cycles and making sure that you&#39;re sort of timing things and tracking things, particularly if you&#39;re trying to conceive deliberately. We always get this question, and I want to know what your thoughts are. Should the couple be trying to conceive every other day during ovulation, or every day during ovulation? I say every other day. One, we need to give the sperm and semen enough time to sort of reaccumulate so we can get those millions of sperm. The other is sperm actually survive in the female genital tract for up to five days. So once the egg is released from the ovary, think of the fallopian tube as an arm with a catcher&#39;s mitt at the end. The catcher&#39;s mitt captures the egg, pulls it into the arm, and then the egg sits around there for 12 to 20 hours waiting for sperm. And then if you have intercourse anywhere within the next 24 hours, sperm will also get to the egg. So that&#39;s why we say every other day around ovulation. There is this movement now, particularly on the internet, discussing what&#39;s called abstinence from pornography, masturbation, and orgasm, or PMO. It&#39;s also a movement called no NoFap. And those individuals say to have the best reserve of sperm or the best sort of power with erections or orgasm, that they should conserve for days, weeks, months at a time. This stuff is not scientific at all. And, in fact, after a week of storing up, the sperm may not necessarily be healthy.</p><p>&#34;Eating pineapple can increase fertility.&#34;</p><p><strong>Duke: </strong>That&#39;s a good one. Pineapple by itself, if you have infertility, is unlikely to reverse your infertility. We know that pineapples have bromelain inside of them, which is a compound that is known to be a blood thinner to a certain degree, but it&#39;s very, very weak, and you&#39;d have to eat so much pineapple to even have enough bromelain to have a little effect. You should be having a meal balancing protein, complex carbohydrates, and fiber. So getting your usual multivitamins and folate into your diet, because folate is really important for once you&#39;re pregnant. But technically, no, pineapple by itself does not boost fertility. Infertility, while a daunting thought, really there are lots of options available. The first step is actually an evaluation. Fertility and infertility constitute this huge spectrum, and there are many, many ways to get pregnant and many things one can do to help facilitate that. And you don&#39;t have to stay at home feeling embarrassed about it. If you talk to a specialist like myself, like Dr. Eleswarapu, we are experienced with this and know how to treat you or direct you to the right person who can help.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/fertility-experts-debunk-19-fertility-pregnancy-myths-2021-3'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/gTcBeZY_XEg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 20:15:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6058a8e81fcb5700186eea8d?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"2614a15ad7224765d98ebe1562e9eda9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-46-03-010_6d6840c68247de4b.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":42526,"destBytes":42526,"author":"atang@businessinsider.com (Abby Tang,Michelle Yan Huang,Ally Giannini)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-09-303_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn34@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-46-06-554_0a5cf741fb4bdf8e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn95@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-46-05-455_195e5a37f0223d9b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-46-06-748_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=gTcBeZY_XEg:CX_wKuKpGaE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-46-04-440_2d45e8b999b581e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/gTcBeZY_XEg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn19@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-03-329_3606d7e6febef1b6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605114842},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","title":"Biden's infrastructure plan does not come close to tackling the vast extent of America's new housing crisis","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/bidens-infrastructure-plan-not-enough-tackle-new-american-housing-crisis-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6065ff1852f11d00194319f9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Housing crisis homeless camp Philadelphia\" height=\"2258\" width=\"3011\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Activists outside a homeless camp in Philadelphia on September 9, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Cory Clark/NurPhoto via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The pandemic has exacerbated the existing housing crisis, and Biden&#39;s plan does not go far enough. </li>\n<li>There is no safety net for housing, making any assistance during economic recessions difficult to deliver. </li>\n<li>The crisis was built by poor government policy.

These proposals are a welcome first step to ensuring safe, affordable, sustainable shelter - and Congress should move swiftly to enact them  - but they do not come close to meeting the scale of the housing crisis that has been underway in the United States for decades.</p><p>The reality is that although the failures in our housing system were exacerbated by the pandemic - to the tune of 10 million people at risk of eviction and<a href=\"https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/averting-an-eviction-crisis.pdf\"> more than $57 billion</a> owed in back rent - the pandemic didn&#39;t cause them. Rents have been soaring for decades, consuming an ever larger share of the incomes of the lowest-income Americans (and during the pandemic, the divergence in rent for low-income tenants versus higher-income tenants has<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/22/rents-rich-are-plummeting-rents-poor-are-rising-why/?itid=ap_catherinerampell\"> worsened</a>). </p><p>While renter incomes grew by 0.5% from 2001 to 2018,<a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/census-income-rent-gap-grew-in-2018\"> rents increased by 13%</a>. Median asking rent has<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf\"> more than doubled</a> over the last 20 years, and in<a href=\"https://reports.nlihc.org/sites/default/files/oor/OOR_BOOK_2020.pdf\"> 95% of counties</a>, a full-time minimum-wage worker cannot afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment. Black and brown people are<a href=\"https://urbn.is/2yyrmsq\"> particularly vulnerable</a> to the extreme instability renters face. With a housing market this fragile during boom times, Americans never stood a chance when a crisis inevitably hit.</p><h2><strong>No housing safety net</strong></h2><p>It doesn&#39;t have to be this way. The economic impact of recessions, such as job losses and income declines, are largely predictable, and policymakers have put in place a number of programs to offset them. When Americans lose their jobs, they can apply for unemployment insurance; when their income and assets drop below a certain threshold, they qualify for nutritional assistance. </p><p>But when it comes to housing, there&#39;s no comparable safety net. The federal government currently offers no guaranteed form of housing assistance, and there are no countercyclical housing programs that expand during downturns or are triggered by economic indicators. This makes it almost impossible to quickly and effectively deliver any assistance that Congress <em>does</em> allocate during a disaster like this one. Variations in application and eligibility requirements across states and cities have led to backlogs in distribution of federal aid money, all while thousands upon thousands of applicants have been <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/12/22/22196601/new-york-rent-relief-expansion-still-strands-many\">denied assistance</a>.</p><p>The fragility of our housing market is <a href=\"https://groundworkcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PastDueHousingPolicy_Final.pdf\">not an accident; policy choices have led to a two-tiered housing market</a> in which relatively well-off, mostly white consumers can achieve the American dream of homeownership - with the help of considerable federal subsidies like the mortgage interest tax deduction - while renters, who are disproportionately Black, brown, and low-income, transfer an increasingly large share of their income to landlords in the private market. Ultimately, the scarcity of affordable and accessible housing in our economy is not reflective of national resources - it is reflective of a centuries-long political debate about who is deserving of public investment, and therefore economic dignity and security.</p><p>Consider the federal budget for housing programs geared toward those with the lowest incomes. Federal spending on housing assistance relative to gross domestic product has<a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/chart-book-cuts-in-federal-assistance-have-exacerbated-families-struggles-to\"> fallen by 30% </a>since the mid-1990s. Funding for public housing in particular has suffered profound losses: in the last 20 years<a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/chart-book-cuts-in-federal-assistance-have-exacerbated-families-struggles-to\"> the annual federal budget</a> has only met operations needs for public housing across the country three times. On top of that, funding for repairs has been cut in half - a trend that can&#39;t be divorced from the long-standing political tradition of pathologizing poor and low-income Black communities. This continued disinvestment has resulted in the<a href=\"https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_The_State_of_the_Nations_Housing_2020_Report_Revised_120720.pdf\"> share of households receiving housing assistance declining to just one in five</a> today. As the rental affordability crisis has worsened, the federal response has shrunk.</p><p>Meanwhile,<a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/chart-book-federal-housing-spending-is-poorly-matched-to-need\"> recent estimates</a> have shown that more than two-thirds of the government&#39;s total spending on housing is allocated toward subsidizing homeowners through tax deductions. The vast majority of benefits from this &#34;entitlement&#34; go to the wealthiest of households, and most Black and brown families are excluded entirely. By structuring housing policy and housing markets so that Americans&#39; homes are their most valuable asset and source of equity, this country has essentially transferred safety net functions to private homeowners (and enabled white families to maintain wealth by passing down the homes they own over generations). </p><h2><strong>Calling on the Biden administration</strong></h2><p>Our government can make different choices. Housing policies that rely on the private market to develop, administer, or maintain housing stock for those who are housing insecure have not come close to meeting the need for millions of people, because genuinely affordable housing is not profitable. If the Biden administration wants to truly &#34;Build Back Better&#34; and deliver on the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan/\">promise</a> of stable housing for all, it must commit to massive, sustained public investments, and a significant shift in our narrative around who is deserving of those investments.</p><p>There is no one silver-bullet solution: a number of approaches must be taken at the federal, state, and local levels (both regulatory <em>and</em> budgetary) to put us on the path toward an equitable and resilient housing system. Experts across the field, including grassroots leaders, researchers, and policymakers, have laid out<a href=\"https://communitychange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New-Deal-for-Housing-Justice.Policy-Paper.Community-Change.1.2020.pdf\"> extensive</a><a href=\"https://homesguarantee.com/wp-content/uploads/Homes-Guarantee-_-Briefing-Book.pdf\"> agendas</a> for these actions. The Biden campaign previously committed to <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/housing/\">fully funding rental assistance</a> for all who qualify - another important start, but one that does not adequately address permanent solutions to housing unaffordability. </p><p>In addition to advancing legislation that, at an absolute minimum, meets the Biden administration&#39;s priorities for housing, Congress must move to repeal the Faircloth Amendment, which has prohibited any increase to public housing stock since its passage over 20 years ago. Congress and the White House must also enact policies and fund programs that prioritize rehabilitation and preservation - not demolition - of homes in disinvested neighborhoods. Keeping new and revitalized homes affordable will also mean a strong commitment to rent control policies that place strict limits on rent increases, as well as exploration of alternative social and collective<a href=\"https://shelterforce.org/2018/07/30/solutions-to-an-unjust-housing-system/\"> ownership</a><a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/community-land-trusts-affordable-housing\"> models</a> that empower tenants and grant them the dignity and security of stable housing.</p><p>The path forward isn&#39;t easy, but the lessons from history are clear. We are long past due for a major course correction in our federal housing policy: not just to patch things up in case of emergency, but to remedy longstanding inequities and recognize shelter as a basic right in the wealthiest country in the world.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

But, relying too fully on corporations whose ultimate focus is their bottom line is not just dystopian, it&#39;s dangerous. </p><p>The pandemic has shown just how quickly things can change.

Sayan mountain range.</p><p>Challenges will include locating someone caught in an avalanche, fixed-rope descent and rescue, as well as shooting and grenade exercises.</p><p>The Sayan March

The Sayan March competition is an opportunity to learn more about Russian practices in extreme conditions, according to Hong Kong based military analyst Song Zhongping.</p><p>&#34;China has to deal with its border dispute with India, and the battlefield in the Tibetan plateau has extremely cold weather and high altitude. China needs to gain experience to tackle new tensions and prepare its response to provocations from India too,&#34; said Song, a former PLA instructor.</p><p>&#34;What&#39;s more, the Chinese military&#39;s missions have expanded from safeguarding its national interests to protecting overseas interests as well, which would cover places with rough conditions and extreme weather.&#34;</p><p>India and China share one of the world&#39;s longest land borders and there have been several bloody conflicts, including the 1962 Himalayan war. Skirmishes have continued to break out sporadically over the years. <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3122320/china-india-border-clash-june-left-four-chinese-dead-one\" data-v-2a60e86e=\"\">Four Chinese and 20 Indian soldiers died in June 2020</a>, in the deadliest clash in decades.</p><p>Beijing has also improved cooperation with Russia - especially on the military front - whenever China has faced setbacks in its relations with the major Western democracies. In December, the two countries signed a 10-year extension to their agreement on mutual launch notifications of ballistic missiles and space rockets.</p><p>China also took part last year in Russia&#39;s International Army Games, as well as the Kavkaz-2020 large scale military exercise. The two countries held their second joint aerial strategic patrol in the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea in December. Their first joint patrol of the area took place in July 2019.</p><p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation between the two countries.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-troops-head-to-russia-for-tough-mountain-warfare-competition-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/QgQ__cqiUUw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 16:09:50 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6069e388856cd700198a3140?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"8fd510f7ad7472d8d18533cea44540a2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn75@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-03-060_120c8fa7a080a21e.webp","destWidth":1960,"destHeight":1470,"sourceBytes":165382,"destBytes":165382,"author":"insider@insider.com (Kristin Huang)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5eeb7e3d3ad8617291295024?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn81@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-07-342_62edb9619906ca95.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f0c9e302618b91ec344d169?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn22@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-46-07-060_e7682963e58fad77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-09-303_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn60@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-04-198_46bcd26e5b86ad20.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn81@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-46-10-602_8ace4fb8a482ddd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-46-06-748_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=QgQ__cqiUUw:Z5E7NKI9esM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn30@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-46-06-343_de900664b24d2945.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/QgQ__cqiUUw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn63@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-46-03-899_0f907724e19c9d44.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605114820},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","title":"MyPillow could lose $65 million from the retailers severing ties with the company -

The <a href=\"https://sofrep.com/fightersweep/what-exactly-was-the-f-15-active-aircraft/\">F-15</a>, on the other hand, was designed from the ground up to go toe to toe with the best Soviet fighters in the sky - and back then Russian fighters were really something to be feared.</p><p>The F-15&#39;s top speed, of slightly over Mach 2.4 or 1,875 mph, is the subject of a bit of debate, as many claim the powerful fighter can go even faster. Either way, it leaves platforms like the F-35 - with a top speed of just 1,230 mph or so - in its dust.</p><p>Even the top-of-the-line F-22 can only achieve Mach 2.2.

Philip Davidson, raised eyebrows at a recent Senate hearing when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/china-could-invade-taiwan-in-next-six-years-top-us-admiral-warns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he suggested China could invade Taiwan within the next six years</a>.</p><p>The nominee to replace Davidson at the head of US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, then went a step further, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/23/taiwan-china-threat-admiral-john-aquilino\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">telling the same committee last week that in his view</a>, &#34;This problem is much closer to us than most think and we have to take this on.&#34;</p><p>At first glance, such concerns might seem justified. The Chinese Communist Party has always viewed the annexation of Taiwan as a key strategic goal, but its posture toward the democratic, self-ruling island has grown markedly more belligerent in recent years. Chinese leaders have publicly reiterated their willingness to use force to &#34;unify&#34; Taiwan with the mainland, while ramping up the pace of military activities in and around the Taiwan Strait.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping has presided over the rapid growth and modernization of the People&#39;s Liberation Army-particularly its navy, air force and missile arsenal. Where Taipei once enjoyed certain advantages in the event of a military conflict, including technological superiority and the benefits of island defense, many military analysts now conclude that China could take Taiwan by force, and that the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/china-s-growing-firepower-casts-doubt-whether-u-s-could-n1262148\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States would be hard-pressed to stop it</a>.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f501e89e6ff30001d4e6c54?format=jpeg\" alt=\"China amphibious tanks invasion\" height=\"1694\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army amphibious tanks land on a beach during a Sino-Russian military exercise near the Shandong Peninsula, China, August 24, 2005.\n<p class=\"copyright\">China Photos/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Nonetheless, there are many good reasons to cast a gimlet eye on Davidson and Aquilino&#39;s warnings of a near-term or even medium-term Chinese invasion of Taiwan.</p><p>First, the US military brass has a long history of inflating threats in order to ensure continued support from elected officials, particularly the lawmakers who fund their operations. It should be no more surprising that the head of Indo-Pacific Command is hyping the prospect of Chinese military adventurism than it is to hear the head of Southern Command opining that fragile states in the Western Hemisphere pose an <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/04/the-existential-angst-of-americas-top-generals-threat-inflation-islamic-state/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#34;existential&#34; threat to the United States</a>.</p><p>The Pentagon&#39;s own annual report to Congress on Chinese military capabilities, released last year, makes clear that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan would be &#34;<a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2332126/dod-releases-2020-report-on-military-and-security-developments-involving-the-pe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a significant political and military risk</a>&#34; for China.</p><p>Large-scale amphibious invasions are hard to pull off under the best of circumstances, and this would likely be the largest mass military mobilization the world has seen since D-Day. It would require the PLA to transport its soldiers across a body of water nearly five times as wide as the English Channel, all while ensuring that it maintains unchallenged control of the seas and airspace around the island.</p><p>As Taiwan-based writer Brian Hioe recently pointed out in a <a href=\"https://newbloommag.net/2021/03/29/china-invasion-possibility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">piece for the online magazine New Bloom</a>, it is doubtful that the PLA currently has adequate amphibious lift capability to sustain an invasion and occupation of Taiwan.</p><p>China could try to make up for this deficiency by utilizing coast guard ships, commercial vessels and even fishing boats - engineering what <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/05/china/china-world-biggest-navy-intl-hnk-ml-dst/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some analysts have called a &#34;reverse Dunkirk&#34;</a> - but that would entail its own discrete risks.</p><p>Whatever the case, it seems clear that Chinese military planners would prefer to have more time to develop their amphibious capabilities before attempting to take Taiwan by force.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f501e897ed0ee001e25d28b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Taiwan China amphibious landing military exercise\" height=\"1634\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Taiwan&#39;s military holds a large-scale exercise in the southern part of the island simulating an attempted amphibious landing by Chinese forces, May 30, 2019.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kyodo News Stills via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Beijing must also factor in the likelihood of an intervention from the US and its allies, particularly Japan, which hosts the largest overseas contingent of American active-duty military personnel. Most of them are stationed in Okinawa, just 750 kilometers - roughly 466 miles - from Taiwan.</p><p>In recent years, the already robust bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill in favor of supporting Taiwan&#39;s autonomy from Beijing has only strengthened, and US public opinion polls also <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/10/poll-shows-increase-in-american-support-for-defending-taiwan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">indicate growing support for the defense of Taiwan</a>.</p><p>Japan, too, maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, and would view any Chinese aggression toward the island as a threat to its own security. <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Biden-s-Asia-policy/Biden-and-Suga-to-note-Taiwan-Strait-in-April-joint-statement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to a recent report in the Nikkei</a>, a leading Japanese newspaper, Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide and President Joe Biden are planning to underscore the importance of stability in the Taiwan Strait in their joint statement when they meet in Washington later this month.</p><p>As the Nikkei notes, the last time Japanese and American leaders expressed such concern was in 1969. Should it wish to forcibly annex Taiwan, Beijing would have to accept the high likelihood of a war with its top two trading partners.</p><p>Even if China successfully pulls off a cross-strait invasion while keeping the US and its allies at bay, the human and economic toll would be nothing short of catastrophic. Taiwan&#39;s technology and manufacturing sectors play crucial roles in global supply chains, and Beijing would likely come under tremendous international pressure, including economic sanctions, to reverse course.</p><p>Bonnie Glaser and Matthew Funaiole, two scholars at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, have also argued that China would have to deal with the prospect of a prolonged resistance movement on the island.</p><p>&#34;An all-out invasion of Taiwan might bog down the PLA in a counterinsurgency effort that lasts for years, which could compromise the military&#39;s modernization efforts, drain precious resources from the Chinese economy, and lead to dissatisfaction at home as the body bags come home, many of them likely to be their parents&#39; only sons,&#34; <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/15/chinas-provocations-around-taiwan-arent-a-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they wrote in Foreign Policy last year</a>.</p><p>This would be exactly the type of aggressive military intervention and occupation that China has castigated the US for mounting in the past.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d405e2d100a2442da30650c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Chinese marines navy landing craft beach\" height=\"957\" width=\"1400\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Chinese troops board landing craft during an amphibious exercise on the coast of southeast China&#39;s Fujian Province, November 27, 1995.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>None of this means that China&#39;s threatening behavior against Taiwan should not be taken seriously.</p><p>PLA warplanes have intruded into Taiwan&#39;s air defense identification zone with such frequency in recent months that the Taiwanese military has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-security/taiwan-says-tracks-intruding-chinese-aircraft-with-missiles-not-always-scrambling-idUSKBN2BL0JS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decided to stop scrambling fighter jets upon each incursion</a>, opting to track them with ground-based missiles in order to conserve resources.</p><p>Deputy Defense Minister Chang Che-ping told lawmakers in Taipei this week that he considered China&#39;s provocations to be a kind of &#34;war of attrition,&#34; likely referring to the fact that Taiwan has incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in additional maintenance costs to facilitate the frequent scrambling of its jets, many of which are older models.</p><p>Chang&#39;s comments speak to a core pillar of China&#39;s strategy: Wearing Taiwan down psychologically in the hope that, eventually, its leaders will be forced to negotiate the terms of their surrender.</p><p>Of course, Beijing itself has undermined that strategy with its brutal crackdown on pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong and on the city&#39;s autonomy, making a mockery of the &#34;One Country, Two Systems&#34; approach that Chinese leaders once put forward as a template for unification with Taiwan.</p><p>Going forward, China is more likely to continue and perhaps build upon its multipronged pressure campaign against Taiwan. This could mean further efforts to isolate Taipei on the world stage by trying to poach its remaining diplomatic allies and continuing to block its access to international organizations.</p><p>It could even try to test Taiwan&#39;s resolve - and the international community&#39;s commitment to defending it - by taking over one of the <a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29494/a-small-island-chain-could-be-the-next-flashpoint-in-taiwan-china-relations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smaller islands that Taiwan administers in the South China Sea</a>. But at least in the immediate term, it is difficult to envision Chinese leaders justifying the political, economic and reputational costs of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan.</p><p>Pentagon officials are fond of saying that the US military is a planning organization. Its job is to plan for contingencies, and a military conflict over Taiwan is certainly worth putting at or near the top of the list. There are a number of scenarios that, while improbable, could spark an escalatory cycle and change China&#39;s cost-to-benefit calculus with regard to Taiwan.</p><p>But no one is served by publicly exaggerating the likelihood of conflict in the Taiwan Strait - not the United States and certainly not the people of Taiwan, who ultimately have the most at stake.</p><p><em>Elliot Waldman is the senior editor of World Politics Review.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/warnings-about-an-imminent-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-are-overblown-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5IkQDWzqp40\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 15:04:12 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f50243ae6ff30001d4e6c5e?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"09c7f2911d4fdb892b3667b19577c6ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-02-944_c0b66a1b7d831166.webp","destWidth":2084,"destHeight":1563,"sourceBytes":218336,"destBytes":218336,"author":"insider@insider.com (Elliot Waldman)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6069d274856cd700198a313b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn18@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-46-10-364_5fdf9829f5604bd4.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f501e89e6ff30001d4e6c54?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn46@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-10-189_6e4c2054b8647e89.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f501e897ed0ee001e25d28b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn86@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-46-07-450_aa3694402fe6164c.webp","https://i.insider.com/5d405e2d100a2442da30650c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn37@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-08-656_4e61c8145cf6aa9c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-09-303_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-11-432_8c4613894b2ab497.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn16@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-46-05-499_996fd4c0562f5df1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-46-06-748_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5IkQDWzqp40:T_3RDcOOC1Q:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn55@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-03-846_2abda8addb6a6273.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5IkQDWzqp40":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn66@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-46-07-964_1a1171e596f00734.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605114874},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","title":"The two final crew members who will orbit Earth on a SpaceX ship, as part of the all-civilian Inspiration4Â mission, have been revealed","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-final-members-of-the-all-civilian-inspiration4mission-revealed-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6065e47b902281001950a91c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Inspiration4_Crew_at_Launch_Site\" height=\"1500\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Inspiration4 Crew at historic Launchpad 39A, provided by SpaceX.

He will charter the flight.</p><p>Though he said he has spent more than 6,000 hours flying jets and ex-military aircraft, he has never been to space. Neither have his three fellow passengers, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-inspiration4-first-ever-private-astronaut-mission-in-late-2021-2021-2\">as Insider previously reported.</a></p><p>Isaacman had several goals in planning this mission: to give a diverse community of individuals the opportunity to fly into space and raise money for St. Jude Children&#39;s Research Hospital in Memphis. </p><p>&#34;The stars really aligned for us in terms of this group&#34;, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/science/30spacex-inspiration4.html?surface=intl-hp-in-other-news&fellback=false&req_id=799563277&algo=bandit-all-surfaces-geo-intl_diversified_impression_cut_iion_2&variant=2_bandit-all-surfaces-geo-intl_impression_cut_2&imp_id=648016376&action=click&module=&pgtype=Homepage&#38;module=&#38;pgtype=Homepage\">he told The New York Times.</a></p><p>&#34;We promised the crew representing some of the best of humanitarian qualities exemplifying our mission ideals of leadership, hope, prosperity and generosity. And I&#39;m pleased to report that we&#39;ve accomplished that goal,&#34; he said. </p><p>Isaacman will serve as the commander for the SpaceX mission. </p><h3><strong>Hayley Arceneaux </strong></h3><p>Announced earlier in February, a 29-year-old childhood cancer survivor and physician assistant at St. Jude Children&#39;s Research, Arceneaux is the second civilian to join the crew.</p><p>At the age of 10, Arceneaux had part of her femur removed from bone cancer. There are many sporting activities that she cannot do for fear of risking an uncontrolled fall. This is because of a metal rod in her left leg, which was implanted during her bone-cancer treatments as a child.</p><p>But now she has the chance to set herself free from all limitations. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/a-29-year-old-woman-who-survived-cancer-as-a-child-was-just-selected-to-fly-to-space-aboard-spacexs-rocket/articleshow/81157380.cms\">In an interview with Insider</a>, she said her orthopedic surgeon told her: &#34;There&#39;s going to be no limits on you in space.&#34;</p><p>Arceneaux will be the youngest American to fly into space and the first with a prosthetic body part. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6065ec7f52f11d0019431979?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Eo6X0V5U0AEXm2x\" height=\"2730\" width=\"3640\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>SpaceX&#39;s Starship SN8 flight test in December 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">SpaceX/Twitter</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Sian Proctor </strong></h3><p>Proctor, a geoscientist, science communication specialist, and analog astronaut, is one of the newest crew members aboard SpaceX&#39;s Dragon spacecraft. </p><p>Proctor secured her seat after winning a contest sponsored by Isaacman&#39;s e-commerce company, <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/inspiration4-team-1st-all-civilian-crew-going-space-revealed-today-t213378\">Today reported.</a></p><p>The contest required all entrants to design an online store using Shift4 Payments&#39; software and then tweet a video describing their space fantasies, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/science/30spacex-inspiration4.html?surface=intl-hp-in-other-news&fellback=false&req_id=799563277&algo=bandit-all-surfaces-geo-intl_diversified_impression_cut_iion_2&variant=2_bandit-all-surfaces-geo-intl_impression_cut_2&imp_id=648016376&action=click&module=&pgtype=Homepage&#38;module=&#38;pgtype=Homepage\">per The New York Times.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005265/en/Final-Crew-Members-Named-for-World%E2%80%99s-First-All-Civilian-Mission-to-Space\">Proctor told Business Wire</a>: &#34;This opportunity is proof that hard work and perseverance can pay off in unimaginable ways,&#34; said Dr. Proctor. &#34;I have always believed that I was preparing for something special, and that moment has arrived with Inspiration4. </p><p>Her excitement was palpable in an interview with Today&#39;s Tom Costello. &#34;It&#39;s like opening up the chocolate bar and seeing the golden ticket to Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory!&#34; she said. </p><h3><strong>Chris Sembroski </strong></h3><p>Joining the other three members is Sembroski, 41, a Lockheed Martin employee and Air Force veteran. </p><p>Sembroski was selected from nearly 72,000 entries in a contributing fundraising campaign for St. Jude. He will act as a mission specialist, aiding payloads and science experiments during the flight. </p><p>&#34;Joining the Inspiration4 crew and its mission of support for St. Jude is truly a dream come true. It is my hope that this flight will inspire others to pay that generosity forward by pledging their support for St. Jude and encouraging kids to dream the impossible, ushering in a new era of space exploration open to all,&#34; he said <a href=\"https://inspiration4.com/crew\">in a statement.</a></p><p>Sembroski first heard about the mission from an advertisement during this year&#39;s Super Bowl event.</p><p>&#34;That was just kind of intriguing,&#34; he told<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/science/30spacex-inspiration4.html?surface=intl-hp-in-other-news&fellback=false&req_id=799563277&algo=bandit-all-surfaces-geo-intl_diversified_impression_cut_iion_2&variant=2_bandit-all-surfaces-geo-intl_impression_cut_2&imp_id=648016376&action=click&module=&pgtype=Homepage&#38;module=&#38;pgtype=Homepage\"> The New York Times</a>. &#34;And so, it&#39;s like, &#39;All right, I&#39;ll donate to St. Jude and throw my name in the hat to see what happens.&#39;&#34;</p><p>The Inspiration4 crew will undergo commercial astronaut training by SpaceX.

From growing up in Berkeley, CA with a single mom, to becoming a White House fellow and rising through the ranks at Goldman Sachs before launching Compass, here are some things to know about the up-and-coming executive.</p><h1>The women in his life have inspired him</h1><p>Reffkin grew up in Berkeley, CA, as an only child with a single mom, who is now a real estate agent for Compass. In a LinkedIn post Thursday after his company went public on the New York Stock Exchange, Reffkin said, &#34;I started Compass because of my mom, Ruth, a single mom who embodies the entrepreneurial spirit.&#34;</p><p>Today, Reffkin lives in New York City with his wife, Benis Reffkin, who is a <a href=\"https://www.benisreffkincoaching.com/\">business and life coach</a>. He dubbed her the &#34;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/most-important-person-my-life-robert-reffkin/\">most important person</a>&#34; in his life and an inspiration, in a LinkedIn post from Mother&#39;s Day 2019 that documented how she lived the American Dream. The couple have three kids together. </p><h1>He&#39;s been a founder before</h1><p>Reffkin started his first business when he was just 15 years old, according to an <a href=\"https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/issue/summer17/article/%E2%80%9C-journey-was-exciting-part%E2%80%9D\">article from Columbia College Today</a>. Backed by babysitting and bar mitzvah money, the young founder started a DJ company called &#34;Rude Boy Productions&#34; that brought in a total of $100,000 by the time he graduated from high school, the article said. </p><p>In later years, Reffkin founded two philanthropic educational groups prior to starting Compass. One is Success Academy Charter Schools, a school system for low-income Black and Hispanic students in New York City that helps diminish educational disparities.</p><p>The second is a 501c3 non-profit called America Needs You, which according to its website, &#34;fights for economic mobility for ambitious, first-generation college students.&#34;</p><h1>He&#39;s a runner, too</h1><p>Though he founded two philanthropic organizations, Reffkin&#39;s generosity doesn&#39;t end there. Even his running hobby is helping others.</p><p>His &#34;primary philanthropic undertaking&#34; has been running a marathon in each of the 50 states in the US to raise $1 million for youth education and enrichment programs, he said in a <a href=\"https://www.americaneedsyou.org/team/profile/robert-reffkin/\">bio on America Needs You</a>. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60538d38f75f09001814eaae?format=jpeg\" alt=\"robert reffkin central park\" height=\"2982\" width=\"3988\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Reffkin running in Central Park in 2014.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Benjamin Lowy/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/compass-ipo-s1-profit-loss-real-estate-tech-brokerage-2021-3\" data-e2e-name=\"inline-read-more-link\">Compass is gearing up for an ambitious $10 billion IPO. We pored over its 261-page S-1 filing and came away with 5 key revelations.</a></em></p><h1>He rose through the ranks on Wall Street</h1><p>Reffkin graduated from Columbia University in just under two years, according to Fortune, which placed him on the 40 under 40 list in 2014. He then became the youngest business analyst ever hired at McKinsey &#38; Company where he spent two years before returning to his alma mater to get his MBA and then going back to Wall Street as an associate at Lazard. </p><p>He then rose through the ranks at Goldman Sachs, eventually becoming the chief of staff for Gary Cohn, the former president and chief operating officer of Goldman. But he left the storied Wall Street firm in 2012 to start his company. </p><h1>Real estate isn&#39;t his forte</h1><p>Reffkin left his banking career to start up Compass with the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/compass-technical-cofounder-ori-allon-2021-3\">tech entrepreneur Ori Allon</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-reffkin-compass-ceo-ipo-real-estate-brokerage-goldman-sachs-2021-3\">sources told Insider previously</a> he didn&#39;t actually know much about the industry he was trying to disrupt, saying he had a rudimentary knowledge and didn&#39;t know the difference between a co-op and an apartment. </p><p>Doing things he&#39;s uncomfortable with is just part of his personality, though. One person said he&#39;s lacked experience in almost everything he&#39;s ever done but that&#39;s part of what makes him an &#34;extraordinary person.&#34;</p><p>His former boss, Cohn, said Reffkin just has an &#34;aura of confidence.&#34;</p><h1>He may someday run for public office</h1><p>In 2005, he was <a href=\"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/fellows/alumni/2005-06.html\">a White House fellow</a> under the George W. Bush administration, where he served as the special assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, John Snow.</p><p>He&#39;s always had big ambitions for his career, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-reffkin-compass-ceo-ipo-real-estate-brokerage-goldman-sachs-2021-3\">sources told Insider previously</a>.

The two have since dropped their endorsement, following Sery Kim&#39;s comments earlier this week, in which she said Chinese immigrants aren&#39;t welcome in the US.</p><p>During a <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/arcrwa-cd-6-republican-candidate-forum-tickets-145134748941#\">GOP candidate forum</a> on Wednesday, Sery Kim and others running talked about China&#39;s influence and immigrants who come to the US from China.</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t want them here at all,&#34; Sery Kim said about Chinese immigrants, to applause from the audience. &#34;They steal our intellectual property. They give us coronavirus.

When Elliot walked away, the doormen closed the apartment doors on her. </p><p>Nationally, recent stories related to anti-Asian violence also paint a grim picture.</p><p>Two weeks ago, police arrested a man in connection to a string of <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/deadly-spa-shootings-in-atlanta-metro-area-2021-3\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"612022ec9a9d514b7fb5562f26433199\">deadly shootings at three Atlanta-area massage parlors</a>. Six out of eight of the victims were Asian women.

While hosting a TikTok livestream one night, Pettito was also on Omegle, a free app that facilitates chats with strangers online.  </p><p>&#34;There are no community guidelines, so it&#39;s not uncommon for people on the website to be saying or doing vulgar things,&#34; Pettito told Insider. &#34;I was on track to make $1,000 that night, and all of a sudden, I was removed from the app and banned for 48 hours.&#34; He lost the $1,000 due to the vulgar comment being picked up on his livestream.</p><p>Pettito recommended other influencers use caution while streaming live &#34;because you can&#39;t edit or take back anything,&#34; he said. Some users even record livestream content and upload it to other platforms, so whatever you say or do can take on a life of its own - for better or worse.</p><h2>Consider hiring an attorney if you have a significant amount of money at stake</h2><p>Dakota Elder, 27, had his YouTube account banned in 2019 and his TikTok account banned in 2020. At the time, he said he had 100,000 subscribers on YouTube and 500,000 followers on TikTok. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606494d6daf0f10018f9938f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Â© Dakota Elder\" height=\"810\" width=\"1080\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Dakota Elder.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dakota Elder</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>He told Insider he still doesn&#39;t know why either account was banned and didn&#39;t hear back from either platform when he asked why. Elder was on track to make about $2,500 in revenue the following month from both accounts.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s going to be a lot of variation depending on the terms of use of the site and the user&#39;s activity before the ban,&#34; Lauritsen said about why platforms may not reveal the reason behind the ban. &#34;The site may not even be obligated to provide a reason.&#34;</p><p>Elder now has over 4.4 million followers on his new <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dakota.e?\">TikTok</a> profile but chose not to recreate his YouTube channel. Despite being permanently banned from both, he created the new TikTok account by just signing up again. </p><p>&#34;Making the new account was smooth as butter,&#34; he said. &#34;I had no problems, and I haven&#39;t had an issue since the first video on the new account.&#34; It was easy to sign back up again, he said, although he couldn&#39;t access the old account, followers, or content. </p><p>Taking the revenue hit was likely the most cost-effective option for Elder, but for creators with a significant amount of money at stake, consulting an attorney could be worth it. </p><p>&#34;I have seen scenarios where clients had music taken down from streaming services, reached out, did not receive a response, then hired me to follow up and I was able to get information,&#34; Lauritsen said. &#34;There is an extra air of legitimacy using an attorney to at least help get you more information.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-avoid-banned-social-media-creators-lawyer-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=biUvEZA2Noo:9wBB-xGplw8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=biUvEZA2Noo:9wBB-xGplw8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=biUvEZA2Noo:9wBB-xGplw8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=biUvEZA2Noo:9wBB-xGplw8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=biUvEZA2Noo:9wBB-xGplw8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=biUvEZA2Noo:9wBB-xGplw8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=biUvEZA2Noo:9wBB-xGplw8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=biUvEZA2Noo:9wBB-xGplw8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/biUvEZA2Noo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 13:15:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60649a2c6183e1001981983c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"ae3800a0bacc61c5e365281547f64950","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn70@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-02-963_1c580382af744736.webp","destWidth":720,"destHeight":540,"sourceBytes":20904,"destBytes":20904,"author":"insider@insider.com (Brian J.

But even though he&#39;s Commander-in-Chief, there&#39;s another politician named Joe who may have more power than our president: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.</p><h2><strong>The most powerful Joe in Washington</strong></h2><p>Joe Biden has the big ideas - infrastructure, voting rights, racial healing, jobs, guns, climate, and, of course, nailing COVID- but as we learned with the stimulus bill, Joe Manchin has the final say on what gets passed. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/6/22313466/covid-stimulus-package-passes-unemployment\">Manchin&#39;s opposition</a> ultimately doomed the $15 minimum wage, reduced eligibility for stimulus checks, and forced last-minute tweaks to unemployment insurance expansion.</p><p>And when Manchin said he&#39;d vote against Neera Tanden, Biden&#39;s original nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, her fate was all but sealed in a Senate split 50 Democrats to 50 Republicans.</p><p>Everyone&#39;s waiting with baited breath every time Manchin speaks - what does he think about the filibuster? When he said he&#39;s open to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/joe-manchin-filibuster-stimulus.html\">making the filibuster harder</a>, Democrats were aglow that they could pass more of Biden&#39;s ambitious agenda.</p><p>What kind of gun safety does he support? He has publicly come out <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/23/politics/manchin-house-gun-bills-democrats/index.html\">against the two gun safety bills</a> passed by the House in March that expand background checks for most gun purchases, instead preferring background checks only for commercial gun transactions.</p><p>Where does he stand on voting rights? Manchin is the only Democrat who is<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-manchin-faces-home-state-pressure-to-oppose-democrats-voting-bill-11616518816\"> not co-sponsoring</a> the For the People Act legislation in the Senate and is<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/manchin-values-bipartisanship-over-voting-rights.html\"> pushing for bipartisan compromise</a>.</p><p>Joe Manchin is at the exact center point of the Senate ideologically and therefore numerically. He represents among the reddest of red states, which gave loser President Donald Trump 68% of the vote, even in 2020. So Manchin stays alive by tacking towards the center, not the left.</p><h2><strong>The most narrow majority possible</strong></h2><p>Manchin being the focal point has frustrated those of us who want Biden to make real progress on his agenda. The president needed a Democratic Senate to get anything of note done, and the wise people of Georgia provided that. Now the expectations could not be higher.</p><p>Every time Joe Manchin peeks to his right a bit, there&#39;s speculation that he&#39;ll <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/01/11/manchin_on_changing_parties_im_a_good_old_west_virginia_conservative_democrat.html\">switch parties</a> - which <a href=\"https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Senator-Manchin-refutes-speculation-of-a-party-switch--400628491.html\">Manchin flatly dismisses</a> - or <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/02/manchin-sinema-challengers-464821\">be challenged in a primary</a>.</p><p>But we need every Democrat we can get to maintain a majority. The moderates give the Dems the majority in the House and Senate. And if the party starts to lose purple states and swing districts, it will lose the majority.</p><p>The Democrats, of course, should have a bigger majority in the Senate. They lost a bunch of winnable races in 2018 and 2020 - such as Cal Cunningham in North Carolina, who lost after a sexting scandal. If more purple or even deep red state Dems were able to get elected like Manchin, his vote and the margin wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue. So Manchin is invaluable in the sense that he can actually win in a place that no other Dem would really have a chance, and he can win when Dems in other, seemingly more friendly states, cannot.</p><p>In the meantime, let&#39;s live with Manchin, because if he switched parties Mitch McConnell would be leader. If he lost in a primary, West Virginians would elect a Republican. We need Joe Manchin right now because if we lost him, we also would lose any chance at progress.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-learn-something-joe-manchin-most-powerful-joe-washington-dc-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/JrQaKk8FyK4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 13:32:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606725f252f11d0019431be6?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7b404ed001930bd44adb6f6c1102e8ce","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn95@2020_5/2021/04/05/06-46-03-233_ca87d62c143e8fde.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":115306,"destBytes":115306,"author":"insider@insider.com (Michael Gordon)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606725f7902281001950abca?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/05/06-46-08-068_ce99715c233afc0c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/05/06-46-09-303_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn80@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-46-11-064_af93d1aa7cffee52.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn14@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-46-08-143_3b4175c60f5fda80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_3/2021/04/05/06-46-06-748_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JrQaKk8FyK4:O-pJTg8FAGg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn96@2020_4/2021/04/05/06-46-05-596_704917bf157eff16.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/JrQaKk8FyK4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn85@2020_1/2021/04/05/06-46-05-805_53a4a44090c50f4a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617605114837},{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 14:45:14","title":"'Godzilla vs. Kong' earned $48 million at the US box office over the weekend, the best opening during the pandemic","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/godzilla-vs-kong-opens-to-best-box-office-during-pandemic-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6069d22aa7d803001963ea8c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"godzilla vs kong\" height=\"1176\" width=\"2392\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;Godzilla vs. Kong&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Warner Bros.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>&#34;Godzilla vs. Kong&#34; earned $48.5 million in its five-day opening weekend at the US box office.</li>\n<li>It&#39;s the best opening yet for a movie at the domestic box office during the year-long pandemic.</li>\n<li>It signals hope for movie theaters, though the industry still has a long road to recovery.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>&#34;Godzilla vs. Kong&#34; beat the odds over the weekend at the box office.</p><p>The new monster movie from Warner Bros. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-defeats-pandemic-with-48m-u-s-start?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=socialcial\">earned $48.5 million</a> at the US box office in its first five days (it opened in theaters on Wednesday), and $32.2 million over the three-day Easter weekend from 3,064 theaters.</p><p>It&#39;s the best domestic opening yet for a movie during the coronavirus pandemic, which has devastated the theatrical industry over the past year.
