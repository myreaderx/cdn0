The company said it plans to expand to additional markets as it gathers customer feedback and refines the service.</p>\n<p>Customers will be able to choose from two plans. There will be a pay-as-you-go monthly plan that costs $39 per month and a discounted annual plan for $34 a month. Unagi does charge a $50 initial setup fee, which means that first month will cost customers $89. The flat monthly fee includes maintenance and insurance for scooter theft or damage.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2027934\" style=\"width: 1061px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2027934\" class=\"wp-image-2027934 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg\" alt=\"unagi model one scooter\" width=\"1051\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg 1051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1051px) 100vw, 1051px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2027934\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Unagi</p></div></p>\n<p>Once a customer subscribes, an assembled Model One scooter is shipped to their home within 24 hours, Unagi promises. The Model One costs $990 for customers who want to buy the scooter outright.</p>\n<p>Once a customer cancels their subscription, Unagi reclaims the scooter, which is then put through an 80-point inspection. Unagi tells TechCrunch that it&#8217;s the same inspection that the scooters go through at the factory. There&#8217;s no written guarantee that subscribers will get a new scooter. However, Unagi said customers will likely get new scooters because the company has been ramping up production since the beginning of the pandemic to meet demand.</p>\n<p>It is a risk for Unagi, but one the company is betting will pay off amid — and after — the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This model is well-suited to today&#8217;s world: as cities re-open, people are rethinking how they get to the supermarket, the post office and the park,&#8221; according to the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://blog.unagiscooters.com/2020/08/05/introducing-unagi-all-access/\">recent blog post</a> announcing the service. &#8220;Data shows COVID-wary consumers are afraid of shared transportation, whether it&#8217;s the subway, an Uber or a shared scooter. They&#8217;re looking for safer alternatives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company was already researching a subscription service before COVID-19 spread throughout the world, according to CEO David Hyman.</p>\n<p>Unagi tested the idea last fall. A deeper study was launched in spring in partnership with UC Berkeley&#8217;s Haas Business School that determined demand was higher than expected.</p>\n<div>&#8220;COVID just reinforced our desire to get it live and was the impetus for going live in both LA and NYC at the same time,&#8221; Hyman told TechCrunch in an email.</div>\n<p>Unagi isn&#8217;t alone in this scooter subscription pivot, or what we like to call hardware-as-a-service. Others are also pursuing this business model, including Dance and Voi.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CD7emw1EpK8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 22:32:23 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg","linkMd5":"493b533317ab8ef963406c9e9d7c8137","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn4@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685523959_355e4597ad9b4e20.webp","author":"Kirsten Korosec","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unagi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn4@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685523959_355e4597ad9b4e20.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn91@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706145_3a002b6de9a9ea4d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CD7emw1EpK8:UV3c8FNLL3I:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn64@2020_3/2020-08-06/1596685707059_2612d4cf0cbbd9db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CD7emw1EpK8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn48@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685704968_0dc7635b810ff5e1.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","title":"Instagram’s hashtag searches gave Trump better treatment than Biden","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2027865","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"instagram\">Instagram <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> apparently handled searches for popular hashtags related to the two presidential candidates differently, pointing Joe Biden search queries toward often negative related hashtags while making no such suggestions in corresponding searches pertaining to President Trump.</p>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/instagrams-hashtag-blocking-favors-trump-hurts-biden\">report by the Tech Transparency Project</a> details the strange platform behavior.

It details a large set of accounts on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other social media that began to be activated early this year that appeared to be part of a global propaganda push:</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<blockquote><p>The network made heavy use of video footage taken from pro-Chinese government channels, together with memes and lengthy texts in both Chinese and English. It interspersed its political content with spam posts, typically of scenery, basketball, models, and TikTok videos. These appeared designed to camouflage the operation’s political content, hence the name.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s the &#8220;return&#8221; of this particular spam dragon because it showed up last fall in a similar form, and whoever is pulling the strings appears undeterred by detection. New, sleeper and stolen accounts were amassed again and deployed for similar purposes, though now — as <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> notes — with a COVID-19 twist.</p>\n<p>When June rolled around, content was also being pushed related to the ongoing protests regarding the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and other racial justice matters.</p>\n<p>The Google post notes that the Chinese campaign, as well as others from Russia and Iran, were multi-platform, as similar findings were reported by Facebook, Twitter and cybersecurity outfits like FireEye.</p>\n<p>Having taken down 186 channels in April, 1,098 in May and 1,312 in June, we may be in for a bumper crop in the summer as well.

venture debt solutions.\t</div>\n\t\n\t</div>\n</div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">While a handful of tech companies like <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/zoom-video-communication-revenue-rises-q1-1202949506/\">Zoom</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/as-e-commerce-booms-during-the-pandemic-shopify-accelerates/\">Shopify</a> are enjoying massive gains as a result of COVID-19, that’s obviously not the case for most. Weaker demand, slower sales cycles, and customer insistence on pricing concessions and payment deferrals have conspired to cloud the outlook for many tech companies’ growth.</p>\n<p>Compounding these challenges, a lot of tech companies are struggling to raise capital just when they need it most. The data so far suggests that investors, particularly those focused on earlier stage financings, are taking a more cautious approach to new deals and valuations while they wait to see how individual companies perform and which way the economy will go. With the outcome of their planned equity financings uncertain, some tech companies are revisiting their funding strategies and exploring alternative sources of capital to fuel their continued growth.</p>\n<h2>Forecasting growth in a pandemic: a difficult job just got harder</h2>\n<p>For certain businesses, COVID-19’s impact on revenue was immediate. For others, the effects of slower economic activity and tighter budgets surfaced more gradually with deals in the funnel before the pandemic closing in April and May. Either way, in the second half of 2020, technology CFOs face a common challenge: How do you accurately forecast sales when there’s very little consensus around key issues such as when business activity will return to pre-COVID levels and what the long-term effects of the crisis might be?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, navigating this uncertainty is just as daunting a challenge for investors. These days, equity investors’ assessment of a company’s growth potential, and the value they are willing to pay for that growth, aren’t just impacted by their view of the company itself. Equally important is their assumptions about when the economy will recover and what the new normal might look like. This uncertainty can lead to situations where companies and their potential investors have materially different views on valuation.</p>\n<h2>Longer funding cycles, more investor-friendly deals</h2>\n<p>While the full impact of COVID was felt too late to have a material impact on Q1 deal volumes, recently released <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q2-2020-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor#:~:text=Q2%202020%20was%20truly%20unprecedented,venture%20industry%20largely%20proved%20resilient.\">data from Pitchbook and the NVCA</a> suggest that 2020 will see a significant decrease in the number of companies funded, possibly by as much 30 percent compared to 2019 among early stage companies. And, while it often takes several months to see evidence of broad trends in investment terms, anecdotal evidence indicates investors are seeking to mitigate risk by demanding additional protective provisions.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4kpv2O42J04\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 17:38:21 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"f025695b4e9315681a6b3cadc5bc0428","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn80@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685705086_f6c6b6bec4bc1b5d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4kpv2O42J04:lggtC6jdiHs:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn24@2020_6/2020-08-06/1596685706227_f5c12d627bddc639.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4kpv2O42J04":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685705959_be84d784413f25ec.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","title":"The story behind Rent the Runway’s first check","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2027258","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">When <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/rent-the-runway\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"rent-the-runway\">Rent the Runway <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> co-founders <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/jennifer-fleiss\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jennifer-fleiss\">Jennifer Fleiss <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/jennifer-hyman\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jennifer-hyman\">Jennifer Hyman <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> got their first term sheet, it had an exploding clause in it: If they didn&#8217;t sign the offer in 24 hours, they would lose the deal.</p>\n<p>The co-founders, then students at Harvard Business School, were ready to commit, but their lawyer advised them to pause and attend the meetings they had previously set up with other investors.</p>\n<p>Twelve years later, Rent the Runway has raised $380 million in venture capital equity funding from top investors like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/10/alibabas-jack-ma-and-joe-tsai-invest-20-million-in-rent-the-runway/\">Alibaba’s Jack Ma</a>, Temasek, Fidelity, Highland Capital Partners and T. Rowe Capital. Fleiss gave up an operational role in the company to a <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/magazine/201707/zoe-henry/jennifer-fleiss-rent-the-runway.html\">board seat in 2017</a>, as the company reportedly was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2017/03/20/rent-the-runway-cofounder-fleiss-bows-out-as-company-preps-for-ipo/#32927abf66c3\">eyeing an IPO.</a></p>\n<p>But the shoe didn’t always fit: Earlier this year, Rent the Runway struggled with supply chain issues that left customers disgruntled. Then, the pandemic threatened the market of luxury wear more broadly: Who needs a ball gown while Zooming from home? In early March, the business went through a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-is-rent-the-runway-still-in-business-founder-moved-quickly-cut-deep-11594393201\">restructuring</a>, furloughing and laying off nearly half of its workforce, including every retail employee at its physical locations.</p>\n<p>In 2009, Fleiss and Hyman were successful Harvard Business School students. Hyman’s college roommate knew a prominent lawyer who agreed to advise them on a contingency basis in exchange for connecting them with potential investors.</p>\n<p>Still, fundraising “was extremely hard,” Hyman said. “We were in the middle of a recession and we were two young women at business school who had never really done anything before.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fleiss said venture capital firms often sent junior associates, receptionists and assistants to take the meeting instead of dispatching a full-time partner. “It was clear they weren’t taking us very seriously,” Fleiss said, recounting that on one occasion, a male investor called his wife and daughter on speaker to vet their thoughts.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to test their thesis that women would pay to rent (and return) luxury clothing, Fleiss and Hyman started doing trunk pop-up shows with 100 dresses. On one occasion, they rented out a Harvard undergraduate dorm room common hall and invited sororities, student activity organizations and a handful of investors.</p>\n<p>Only one person showed up, said Fleiss: A guy &#8220;who was 30 years older than anyone else in the room.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Old-fashioned meets nontraditional<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/chsFLebXvlc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 19:18:40 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/lead.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"6d5d9af691717aff4909e4da550e82ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn91@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685705627_2303ea8e51f61d76.webp","author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn92@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685705018_dae30eb8aa5dbfe8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=chsFLebXvlc:1w7Stt-FGb8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn87@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685706048_d461d1526b6e6967.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/chsFLebXvlc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn16@2020_3/2020-08-06/1596685705056_9ceb2d87612c6084.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","title":"Just 72 hours left to save up to $300 on Disrupt 2020 passes","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2025489","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It takes a village — or in this case a kickass global startup community — to help you survive and thrive in challenging times.

The news of the coming service was announced this week by Tinder parent Match Group during its <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/MTCH-2Q-2020-Earnings-Release.pdf\">Q2 2020 earnings</a> call with investors. Match described the subscription as providing additional value beyond Tinder&#8217;s current paid plan, Tinder Gold, but noted the feature was still in the very early stages of testing and was essentially still considered a minimum viable product.</p>\n<p>The company added the version of Platinum that&#8217;s live now doesn&#8217;t yet have all the features Tinder plans to test. Though Match didn&#8217;t offer specifics as to the feature set itself, it broadly described Platinum as a way to give power users &#8220;more control, a better experience, and more advantages.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The confirmation of the test follows a recent report by a user who had spotted Platinum in the wild.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>According to a U.K.-based Tinder user, the offer for Platinum popped up when they were using Tinder on the web. But they weren&#8217;t able to make a purchase, they said.</p>\n<p>However, in the screenshots <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/hsj6hx/i_found_a_new_subscription_feature_on_the_website/\">they provided and posted to Reddit</a>, Platinum is described as offering everything already available through Tinder Gold, along with a handful of extra options. Specifically, Tinder&#8217;s marketing touted that Platinum subscribers would have the ability to message users before matching via Super Likes. They would also get &#8220;prioritized likes&#8221; (meaning subscribers&#8217; likes would be seen first) and they&#8217;d have the ability to see who already liked them for instant matching purposes.</p>\n<p>The image also showed price points as £5.97 per month if on an annual plan, £8.35 per month if on a six-month plan or £14.32 per month if paying monthly.</p>\n<p>Of course, these prices could change. Tinder typically tests different price points alongside new features before launching them publicly.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2027886\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2027886\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2027886\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png 1906w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?resize=768,353 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?resize=680,312 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?resize=1536,705 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2027886\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/hsj6hx/i_found_a_new_subscription_feature_on_the_website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reddit user EL_Goat <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>\n<p>Match Group told investors on the call it expects Platinum to mostly be an ARPU (average revenue per user) driver. Tinder&#8217;s ARPU was down 2% on a quarter-over-quarter basis in Q2, the company noted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unlike Gold, which was by far the most successful and unique revenue feature we&#8217;ve ever launched, [and] which drove meaningful ARPU increases along with almost doubling of subscriber conversion, [Platinum] is not at all expected to be anywhere close to Gold,&#8221; explained Match Group CEO Shar Dubey. &#8220;There’s a fair bit of testing still to be done. And our goal is that, if all goes well, we should be able to globally roll this out by the end of the year, later in Q4,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>Match&#8217;s plans to squeeze more revenue out of its flagship app Tinder comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted how people use dating apps. The company said the health crisis had led to weaker à la carte purchases and some shifts among users to lower-priced packages. Tinder also had to revamp its Tinder U product for college students, as students left their respective campuses. And it lost momentum in India, a key international market, as well as Brazil.</p>\n<p>Despite these issues, Match beat on earnings with $103.1 million in profits, or $0.51 per share, on revenues of $555.5.million, topping Wall Street estimates. The company cited its launches of video dating products as helping it continue to drive revenue through the pandemic &#8212; a time when people may be less willing to immediately meet up in person.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Tinder&#8217;s average subscriber base increased by 128,000 in Q2, up 18% year-over-year, to reach 6.2 million. Tinder&#8217;s direct revenue grew 15% year-over-year, the company said.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/NpXYQPfH-o0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 20:30:59 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?w=680","linkMd5":"03032835a27f86016ee6383eb0fbaaa3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn99@2020_6/2020-08-06/1596685523494_1b59a79833593d7b.webp","author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sxihlj77dab51.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn99@2020_6/2020-08-06/1596685523494_1b59a79833593d7b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_6/2020-08-06/1596685705053_0f213ed4d9524a5f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=NpXYQPfH-o0:wFunm09oFVo:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn99@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685706238_c1e894a750365f2c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/NpXYQPfH-o0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685706119_7b662db77a3db59e.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","title":"DoorDash launches a convenience store","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2027834","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">On-demand delivery startup <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"doordash\">DoorDash <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a href=\"https://blog.doordash.com/introducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d\">has launched a digital storefront</a> to sell household items, as well as the types of things you&#8217;d find at a convenience store.

What isn&#8217;t a voice gets carefully removed even during speech, and what remains sounds clearer. That&#8217;s pretty much it! There&#8217;s very little latency (15 milliseconds is the claim) and a modest computational overhead, meaning it can work on practically any device, especially ones with AI acceleration units like most modern smartphones.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The company began by offering its standalone software for free, with a paid tier that removed time limits. It also shipped integrated into popular social chat app Discord. But the real business is, unsurprisingly, in enterprise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Early on our revenue was all pro, but in December we started onboarding enterprises. COVID has really accelerated that plan,&#8221; explained Davit Baghdasaryan, co-founder and CEO of Krisp. &#8220;In March, our biggest customer was a large tech company with 2,000 employees — and they bought 2,000 licenses, because everyone is remote. Gradually enterprise is taking over, because we&#8217;re signing up banks, call centers and so on.

Baghdasaryan says the company went from 0 to 600 paying enterprises, and $0 to $4 million annual recurring revenue, in a single year, which probably makes the investment — by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/storm-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"storm-ventures\">Storm Ventures, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Sierra Ventures, TechNexus and Hive Ventures — look like a pretty safe one.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a big win for the Krisp team, which is split between the U.S. and Armenia, where the company was founded, and a validation of a global approach to staffing — world-class talent isn&#8217;t just to be found in California, New York, Berlin and other tech centers, but in smaller countries that don&#8217;t have the benefit of local hype and investment infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Funding is another story, of course, but having raised money the company is now working to expand its products and team. Krisp&#8217;s next move is essentially to monitor and present the metadata of conversation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The next iteration will tell you not just about noise, but give you real time feedback on how you are performing as a speaker,&#8221; Baghdasaryan explained. Not in the toastmasters sense, exactly, but haven&#8217;t you ever wondered about how much you actually spoke during some call, or whether you interrupted or were interrupted by others, and so on?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Speaking is a skill that people can improve. Think Grammar.ly for voice and video,&#8221; Baghdasaryan ventured. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be subtle about how it gives that feedback to you. When someone is speaking they may not necessarily want to see that. But over time we&#8217;ll analyze what you say, give you hints about vocabulary, how to improve your speaking abilities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since architecturally Krisp is privy to all audio going in and out, it can fairly easily collect this data. But don&#8217;t worry — like the company&#8217;s other products, this will be entirely private and on-device. No cloud required.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very opinionated here: Ours is a company that never sends data to its servers,&#8221; said Baghdasaryan. &#8220;We&#8217;re never exposed to it. We take extra steps to create and optimize our tech so the audio never leaves the device.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That should be reassuring for privacy wonks who are suspicious of sending all their conversations through a third party to  be analyzed. But after all, the type of advice Krisp is considering can be done without really &#8220;understanding&#8221; what is said, which also limits its scope. It won&#8217;t be coaching you into a modern Cicero, but it might help you speak more consistently or let you know when you&#8217;re taking up too much time.</p>\n<p>For the immediate future, though, Krisp is still focused on improving its noise-suppression software, <a href=\"https://krisp.ai/\">which you can download for free here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TScrMJuYNk8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 19:45:15 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/machine-learning-sound.png?w=711","linkMd5":"6e2b437091c0693d5f1345d184f3b9e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn12@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685705099_bde63f198fa13848.webp","author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn24@2020_6/2020-08-06/1596685706324_d90c143d92f5f3dc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=TScrMJuYNk8:ZrDhfgU2sTM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685706050_a6dd40b13742e9c7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TScrMJuYNk8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn32@2020_3/2020-08-06/1596685706392_487b4bf694f44043.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","title":"A new technique can detect newer 4G ‘stingray’ cell phone snooping","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026758","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Security researchers say they have developed a new technique to detect modern cell-site simulators.</p>\n<p>Cell site simulators, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/07/31/protests-surveillance-stingrays-dirtboxes-phone-tracking/\">known as &#8220;stingrays,&#8221;</a> impersonate cell towers and can capture information about any phone in its range — including in some cases calls, messages and data. Police secretly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/aclu-ice-stingray-documents/\">deploy stingrays hundreds of times</a> a year across the United States, often capturing the data on innocent bystanders in the process.</p>\n<p>Little is known about stingrays, because they are deliberately shrouded in secrecy. Developed by Harris Corp. and sold exclusively to police and law enforcement, stingrays are covered under strict nondisclosure agreements that prevent police from discussing how the technology works. But what we do know is that stingrays exploit flaws in the way that cell phones connect to 2G cell networks.</p>\n<p>Most of those flaws are fixed in the newer, faster and more secure 4G networks, though not all. Newer cell site simulators, called &#8220;Hailstorm&#8221; devices, take advantage of similar flaws in 4G that let police snoop on newer phones and devices.</p>\n<p>Some phone apps claim they can detect stingrays and other cell site simulators, but most produce <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/stingray-detector-apps-andorid-basically-useless-research/\">wrong results</a>.</p>\n<p>But now researchers at the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/electronic-frontier-foundation\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"electronic-frontier-foundation\">Electronic Frontier Foundation <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> have discovered a new technique that can detect Hailstorm devices.</p>\n<p>Enter the EFF&#8217;s latest project, <a href=\"https://github.com/EFForg/crocodilehunter\">dubbed &#8220;Crocodile Hunter&#8221;</a> — named after Australian nature conservationist Steve Irwin who was killed by a stingray&#8217;s barb in 2006 — helps detect cell site simulators and decodes nearby 4G signals to determine if a cell tower is legitimate or not.</p>\n<p>Every time your phone connects to the 4G network, it runs through a checklist — known as a handshake — to make sure that the phone is allowed to connect to the network. It does this by exchanging a series of unencrypted messages with the cell tower, including unique details about the user&#8217;s phone — such as its IMSI number and its approximate location. These messages, known as the master information block (MIB) and the system information block (SIB), are broadcast by the cell tower to help the phone connect to the network.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is where the heart of all of the vulnerabilities lie in 4G,&#8221; said Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the EFF, who headed the research.</p>\n<p>Quintin and fellow researcher Yomna Nasser, who <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/announcing-gotta-catch-em-all-understanding-how-imsi-catchers-exploit-cell\">authored</a> the EFF&#8217;s technical paper on how cell site simulators work, found that collecting and decoding the MIB and SIB messages over the air can identify potentially illegitimate cell towers.</p>\n<p>This became the foundation of the Crocodile Hunter project.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2026764\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2026764\" class=\"wp-image-2026764 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2026764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A rare public photo of a stingray, manufactured by Harris Corp. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</p></div></p>\n<p>Crocodile Hunter is open-source, allowing anyone to run it, but it requires a stack of both hardware and software to work. Once up and running, Crocodile Hunter scans for 4G cellular signals, begins decoding the tower data, and uses trilateration to visualize the towers on a map.</p>\n<p>But the system does require some thought and human input to find anomalies that could identify a real cell site simulator. Those anomalies can look like cell towers appearing out of nowhere, towers that appear to move or don&#8217;t match known mappings of existing towers, or are broadcasting MIB and SIB messages that don&#8217;t seem to make sense.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why verification is important, Quintin said, and stingray-detecting apps don&#8217;t do this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just because we find an anomaly, doesn&#8217;t mean we found the cell site simulator. We actually need to go verify,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In one test, Quintin traced a suspicious-looking cell tower to a truck outside a conference center in San Francisco. It turned out to be a legitimate mobile cell tower, contracted to expand the cell capacity for a tech conference inside. &#8220;Cells on wheels are pretty common,&#8221; said Quintin. &#8220;But they have some interesting similarities to cell site simulators, namely in that they are a portable cell that isn&#8217;t usually there and suddenly it is, and then leaves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In another test carried out earlier this year at the ShmooCon security conference in Washington, D.C. where cell site simulators <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/stingrays-found-in-washington-dc-homeland-security-says/\">have been found before</a>, Quintin found two <span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;\">suspicious </span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">cell towers using Crocodile Hunter: One tower that was broadcasting a mobile network identifier associated with a Bermuda cell network and another tower that didn&#8217;t appear to be associated with a cell network at all. Neither made much sense, given Washington, D.C. is nowhere near Bermuda.</span></p>\n<p>Quintin said that the project was aimed at helping to detect cell site simulators, but conceded that police will continue to use cell site simulators for as long as the cell networks are vulnerable to their use, an effort that could take years to fix.</p>\n<p>Instead, Quintin said that the phone makers could do more at the device level to prevent attacks by allowing users to switch off access to legacy 2G networks, effectively allowing users to opt-out of legacy stingray attacks. Meanwhile, cell networks and industry groups should work to fix the vulnerabilities that Hailstorm devices exploit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;None of these solutions are going to be foolproof,&#8221; said Quintin. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not even doing the bare minimum yet.&#8221;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849 or send an encrypted email to: zack.whittaker@protonmail.com</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/tC_0IKd5ngA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 18:00:30 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg","linkMd5":"f01cf50e9f7047ab10053239ef57dba9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685524085_40488bcabcc1e61f.webp","author":"Zack Whittaker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harris-stingray-ft.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685524085_40488bcabcc1e61f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn60@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685706909_a5d30737814e6bb6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tC_0IKd5ngA:cLgrgnF1hR0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn75@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706116_6b04e35fd81735a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/tC_0IKd5ngA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn8@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685706235_37c7766aec3c843a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","title":"Go public now while software valuations make no sense","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2027717","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Software valuations are bonkers, which means it&#8217;s a great time to go public.

Filed today, the suits argue both <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Lyft are misclassifying their drivers as independent contractors and aim to enforce the labor practices set forth by AB 5.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Uber and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/lyft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lyft\">Lyft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> business model rests on the misclassification of drivers as independent contractors,” California Labor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower said in a statement. &#8220;This leaves workers without protections such as paid sick leave and reimbursement of drivers’ expenses, as well as overtime and minimum wages.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The goals of the separate suits are to recover the money that is allegedly owed to these drivers. By classifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, both Uber and Lyft have not been required to pay minimum wage, overtime compensation, nor have they been required to offer paid breaks or reimburse drivers for the costs of driving.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>AB 5, which went into law earlier this year, outlines what type of worker can and cannot be classified as an independent contractor. The law codifies the ruling established in <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S222732.PDF\">Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles</a>. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S222732.PDF\">ABC test</a>, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, performs work outside the scope of the entity’s business and is regularly engaged in work of some independently established trade or other similar business.</p>\n<p>These suits are seeking for the court to order Uber and Lyft to classify their drivers as employees and provide them with all the protections that come with being a W-2 employee.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"m_3454833882775304930gmail-docs-internal-guid-ed2559f7-7fff-7bc3-087a-263d32bcaf0f\">&#8220;For years Uber and Lyft have been stealing wages and exploiting every legal loophole they can to avoid paying drivers what they deserve,&#8221; Transport Workers Union President John Samuelsen said in a statement. &#8220;It was shameful before and it is even more shameful now, during the middle of a pandemic, that we have allowed wealthy companies to get away with this. This lawsuit is an essential part of holding these companies accountable and protecting drivers’ rights.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>These new lawsuits come just months before Californians are set to vote on Prop 22, a ballot measure backed by Uber, Lyft and others. The ballot measure looks to implement an earnings guarantee of at least 120% of minimum wage while on the job, 30 cents per mile for expenses, a healthcare stipend, occupational accident insurance for on-the-job injuries, protection against discrimination and sexual harassment and automobile accident and liability insurance. Most notably, however, it would keep drivers classified as independent contractors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[&#8230;]as this lawsuit clearly demonstrates, Sacramento politicians are more interested in the wishes of their special interest donors than the will of the vast majority of drivers and are intent on stripping drivers of the freedom to choose independent work,&#8221; the Yes on 22 campaign said in a statement. &#8220;This coordinated effort by all levels of government to run a politically motivated campaign will hurt the state at the worst possible time.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/icEOxJS_TCM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 23:16:21 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"d19236ae1baeb568da5b4f46a71dc57f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Megan Rose Dickey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn20@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685706283_a0fad9c349639fff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=icEOxJS_TCM:dZzVXdArsGw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685706093_a36b6817208266b4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/icEOxJS_TCM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_3/2020-08-06/1596685706396_394c20840d28881b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","title":"Facebook just took down a Trump post that claimed kids are immune to COVID-19","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2028021","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Facebook took down a video President Trump posted to his account Wednesday, citing its rules against false claims about the coronavirus.

The <a href=\"https://openservicemesh.io/\">Open Service Mesh</a> is meant to be a reference implementation of the <a href=\"https://smi-spec.io/\">Service Mesh Interface</a> (SMI) spec, a standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes that has the backing of most of the players <a href=\"https://smi-spec.io/#ecosystem\">in this ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<p>The company plans to donate Open Service <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/mesh-5\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mesh-5\">Mesh <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> to the <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/\">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF) to ensure that it is community-led and has open governance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;SMI is really resonating with folks and so we really thought that there was room in the ecosystem for a reference implementation of SMI where the mesh technology was first and foremost implementing those SMI APIs and making it the best possible SMI experience for customers,&#8221; Microsoft director of partner management for Azure Compute (and CNCF board member) Gabe Monroy told me.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2027728\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OSM-Demo-2.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2027728\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2027728\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OSM-Demo-2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"570\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2027728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>\n<p>He also added that, because SMI provides the lowest common denominator API design, Open Service Mesh gives users the ability to &#8220;bail out&#8221; to raw Envoy if they need some more advanced features. This &#8220;no cliffs&#8221; design, Monroy noted, is core to the philosophy behind Open Service Mesh.</p>\n<p>As for its feature set, SMI handles all of the standard service mesh features you&#8217;d expect, including securing communications between services using mTLS, managing access control policies, service monitoring and more.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2027729\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OSM-Demo-3.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2027729\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2027729\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OSM-Demo-3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"570\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2027729\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>\n<p>There are plenty of other service mesh technologies in the market today, though. So why would Microsoft launch this?</p>\n<p>&#8220;What our customers have been telling us is that solutions that are out there today, Istio being a good example, are extremely complex,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just me saying this. We see the data in the AKS support queue of customers who are trying to use this stuff &#8212; and they&#8217;re struggling right here. This is just hard technology to use, hard technology to build at scale. And so the solutions that were out there all had something that wasn&#8217;t quite right and we really felt like something lighter weight and something with more of an SMI focus was what was going to hit the sweet spot for the customers that are dabbling in this technology today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Monroy also noted that Open Service Mesh can sit alongside other solutions like Linkerd, for example.</p>\n<p>A lot of pundits expected Google to also donate its Istio service mesh to the CNCF. That move didn&#8217;t materialize. &#8220;It&#8217;s funny. A lot of people are very focused on the governance aspect of this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think when people over-focus on that, you lose sight of how are customers doing with this technology. And the truth is that customers are not having a great time with Istio in the wild today. I think even folks who are deep in that community will acknowledge that and that&#8217;s really the reason why we&#8217;re not interested in contributing to that ecosystem at the moment.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bQL2ZPb8QM\"><p><a

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QT9KH09OQE\">Tech for Good Declaration</a>.\t</div>\n\t\n\t</div>\n</div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">America’s technology industry, radiating brilliance and profitability from its Silicon Valley home base, was until recently a shining beacon of what made America great: Science, progress, entrepreneurship. But public opinion has swung against big tech amazingly fast and far; negative views <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/29/americans-have-become-much-less-positive-about-tech-companies-impact-on-the-u-s/\">doubled</a> between 2015 and 2019 from 17% to 34%. The list of concerns is long and includes privacy, treatment of workers, marketplace fairness, the carnage among ad-supported publications and the poisoning of public discourse.</p>\n<p>But there’s one big issue behind all of these: An industry ravenous for growth, profit and power, that has failed at treating its employees, its customers and the inhabitants of society at large as human beings. Bear in mind that products, companies and ecosystems are built by people, for people. They reflect the values of the society around them, and right now, America’s values are in a troubled state.</p>\n<p>We both have a lot of respect and affection for the United States, birthplace of the microprocessor and the electric guitar. We could have pursued our tech careers there, but we’ve declined repeated invitations and chosen to stay at home here in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/canada-c0c7\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"canada-c0c7\">Canada <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>. If you want to build technology to be harnessed for equity, diversity and social advancement of the many, rather than freedom and inclusion for the few, we think Canada is a good place to do it.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>U.S. big tech is correctly seen as having too much money, too much power and too little accountability. Those at the top clearly see the best effects of their innovations, but rarely the social costs. They make great things — but they also disrupt lives, invade privacy and abuse their platforms.</p>\n<p>We both came of age at a time when tech aspired to something better, and so did some of today’s tech giants. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/tech-antitrust-hearing/\">Four big tech CEOs recently testified in front of Congress</a>. They were grilled about alleged antitrust abuses, although many of us watching were thinking about other ills associated with some of these companies: tax avoidance, privacy breaches, data mining, surveillance, censorship, the spread of false news, toxic byproducts, disregard for employee welfare.</p>\n<p>But the industry’s problem isn’t really the products themselves — or the people who build them. Tech workers tend to be dramatically more progressive than the companies they work for, as Facebook staff showed in their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html\">recent walkout</a> over President Donald Trump’s posts.</p>\n<p>Big tech’s problem is that it amplifies the issues Americans are struggling with more broadly. That includes economic polarization, which is echoed in big-tech financial statements, and the race politics that prevent tech (among other industries) from being more inclusive to minorities and talented immigrants.</p>\n<p>We’re particularly struck by the Trump administration’s recent moves to deny opportunities to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/06/21/trump-h1b-visa-program-restrictions/\">H-1B visa holders</a>. Coming after several years of family separations, visa bans and anti-immigrant rhetoric, it seems almost calculated to send IT experts, engineers, programmers, researchers, doctors, entrepreneurs and future leaders from around the world — the kind of talented newcomers who built America’s current prosperity — fleeing to more receptive shores.</p>\n<p>One of those shores is Canada’s; that’s where we live and work. Our country has long courted immigration, but it’s turned around its longstanding brain-drain problem in recent years with policies designed to scoop up talented people who feel uncomfortable or unwanted in America. We have an immigration program, the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/global-talent.html\">Global Talent Stream</a>, that helps innovative companies fast-track foreign workers with specialized skills. Cities like <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/17/nixing-silicon-valley-us-companies-now-tapping-canada-for-tech-talent.html\">Toronto, Montreal, Waterloo and Vancouver</a> have been leading North America in tech job creation during the Trump years, fuelled by outposts of the big international tech companies but also by scaled-up domestic firms that do things the Canadian way, such as enterprise software developer <a href=\"https://news.communitech.ca/opentext-made-in-canada-proud-of-it/\">OpenText</a> (one of us is a co-founder) and e-commerce giant <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/shopify-displaces-rbc-to-become-canada-s-most-valuable-company-1.1432436\">Shopify</a>.</p>\n<p>“Canada is awesome. Give it a try,” <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shopify\">Shopify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> CEO Tobi Lütke <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-23/-canada-is-awesome-shopify-ceo-tells-workers-barred-from-u-s\">told disaffected U.S. tech workers</a> on Twitter recently.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about policy; it’s about underlying values. Canada is exceptionally comfortable with diversity, in theory (as expressed in immigration policy) and practice (just walk down a street in Vancouver or Toronto). We’re not perfect, but we have been competently led and reasonably successful in recognizing the issues we need to deal with. And our social contract is more cooperative and inclusive.</p>\n<p>Yes, that means public health care with no copays, but it also means more emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.thespec.com/opinion/contributors/2020/01/30/it-s-time-responsible-corporations-became-part-of-global-solutions.html\">sustainability, corporate responsibility</a> and a more collaborative strain of capitalism. Our federal and provincial governments have mostly been applauded for their gusher of stimulative wage subsidies and grants meant to sustain small businesses and tech talent during the pandemic, whereas Washington’s response now appears to have been formulated in part to <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/congress-created-virus-aid-then-reaped-the-benefits/\">funnel public money to elites</a>.</p>\n<p>American big tech today feels morally adrift, which leads to losing out on talented people who want to live the values Silicon Valley used to stand for — not just wealth, freedom and the few, but inclusivity, diversity and the many. Canada is just one alternative to the U.S. model, but it’s the alternative we know best and the one just across the border, with loads of technology job openings.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t surprise us if more tech refugees find themselves voting with their feet.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/N23u72BFWvw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 16:30:29 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-144294718.jpg?w=602","linkMd5":"98f73b7663c990d533212ae55b1df59b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn87@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685705649_aab89eb5425c9e3d.webp","author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn56@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685705126_8014ac1beabfbbf0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=N23u72BFWvw:pv4BfhNkYRU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_6/2020-08-06/1596685707166_d42dd580691b81aa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/N23u72BFWvw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn96@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685704980_fc7ed76fd8f1a17d.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:22","title":"Black Founders Matter, a fund focused on Black entrepreneurs, makes first investment","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2027389","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Too often, Black founders are locked out of Silicon Valley before they even have a chance to get started, Marceau Michel, founder of venture capital firm <a href=\"https://www.blackfoundersmatter.org/\">Black Founders Matter</a>, tells TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important we&#8217;re looking at the social justice movement from very different places,&#8221; Michel says. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing for Black people to not be killed by the police &#8212; that&#8217;s just the baseline. We still have Black people locked out of economic opportunity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Michel has not given up on his mission to raise a $10 million fund to invest in Black entrepreneurs. Michel and I first chatted back in 2018, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/29/black-founders-matter-wants-to-raise-10-million-to-fund-black-led-startups/\">when he unveiled the fund</a>. Between then and now, Michel worked for a VC firm in Portland to better understand how the industry works. He also toyed with the idea of launching an incubator for Black entrepreneurs, instead of creating a fund. But what he landed on was that the tech industry needs more deciders, he says. So far, Black Founders Matter has raised about $1 million for the fund.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We’re not struggling to raise this fund now,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It’s very tangible and very much in hand. The investors we’re having conversations with understand the importance of the work we’re doing investing in Black and diverse problem solvers make this society better.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>But it didn&#8217;t always feel like a feasible goal, Michel says. What makes it feel more achievable today is the heightened attention and conversations around racism in our society, he says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now, because it&#8217;s in the national conversation and in people&#8217;s minds, these resources are coming in quicker and the investors we&#8217;re talking to get what we&#8217;re trying to do,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You can do great work and you can also get profits. Those things are not mutually exclusive. We&#8217;ve had to turn investors down that were looking at Black Founders Matter as a charity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last month, Black Founders Matter made its first investment in a company called <a href=\"https://akidsbookabout.com/\">A Kids Book About</a>, founded by Jelani Memory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a world where we look at how Black lives matter but also how we look at the quality of Black life in this country, it&#8217;s about creating access for the community to be able to solve problems,&#8221; Michel says.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what the fund&#8217;s first investment did. A Kids Book About, which published its first book on the topic of racism in October, helps solve a problem for all communities, he says. Black Founders Matter only invested $40,000, but that figure is more of a reflection of how much space was left in the round. Michel says Memory carved out that space for Black Founders Matter by turning down other checks. Beyond this investment, there are a number of other companies on the firm&#8217;s radar, but first, it&#8217;s a matter of getting the funds to invest.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;This whole experience of raising this venture fund and working in this space was an exercise in being patient and not forcing it before it was its time,&#8221; Michel says. &#8220;And now, it’s clearly time and the floodgates have opened. And we’re able to do it with integrity and authenticity. I’m not at a place where I need to convince people anymore. We&#8217;re able to have conversations with authority and not from a place of desperation. We’re able to be selective about who invests in our fund. We can be selective and that is a very good sign of the future of Black entrepreneurship.&#8221;</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_4TJ1Ji8Z14\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 20:39:32 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unnamed.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"350a6df1e27e12cdd73dcb1da45e2151","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn4@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685705096_b7ea4b3bfbd5b10a.webp","author":"Megan Rose Dickey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685523432_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706364_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685704982_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn51@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596685706074_9e643669bdcd5bce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_4TJ1Ji8Z14:okKxJiSIu04:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn72@2020_6/2020-08-06/1596685705070_d0c1203267236647.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_1/2020-08-06/1596685707036_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_4TJ1Ji8Z14":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn60@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596685705056_b558380418ecdf90.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:45:23","feedId":26,"fetchDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 03:45:23 +0000","fetchMs":28,"handleMs":4381,"totalMs":549222,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"34.246.118.170","hostName":"europe-001.herokuapp.com","requestId":"2aadbdb173c142f5a8660c5afd978a7d_26","bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":19,"articlesImgsTotal":78,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":77},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-05 12:58:15","id":26,"name":"TechCrunch","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://s.yimg.com/oa/build/images/favicons/techcrunch.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_4/2020-08-06/1596685521077_f2e65e4f8ef2441a.ico","description":"TechCrunch is a group-edited blog that profiles the companies, products and events defining and transforming the new web.","weekly":null,"link":"https://techcrunch.com"},"extra4":{"start":1596685518831,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":96,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":4381,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":181645,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":182985,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":181495,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":78,"extra6":77,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]}
