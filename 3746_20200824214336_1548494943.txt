They've carried out some schemes, but seemingly haven't done much in the grand scheme. In place of direct actions, the situations with Muhyo summoning Hades and Roji undergoing Enforcer Page’s trial have taken the forefront of recent episodes. While they may not have had the spotlight, there is reason to believe that the Bellocent incident might be connected to Enchu’s plans.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing to address is what Enchu and Teeki have been doing since their initial appearance. The events of the most recent episode link back to the fifth episode, where Enchu and Teeki infiltrate a bookstore which has connections to the Magic Association. After taking an older civilian hostage, they demand to know where the “genuine article” is from a younger worker. It’s clear that Enchu used his knowledge of Association-member identities to find this person. While the fate of this person is rather unclear, the result of this confrontation sets in motion their efforts.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-captain-tosen-zanpakuto-suzumushi-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bleach: Captain Tosen's Bloodless Zanpakuto, Suzumushi, Explained</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The events leading to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/muhyo-rojis-bureau-season-2-episode-6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enforcer Page’s trial</a> start after this scene, hinting at the idea that Enchu and his associates discovered the location of this “genuine article” before the test could begin. From that moment in the bookstore, Teeki and Enchu seem to go different ways. While Enchu is walking in a city-like area, Teeki is eerily close to Magic Law Academy. He moves through the scenes as a dark shadow illuminated by the storm as people try to get explosive equipment so that Page can get inside.</span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Teeki-Illuminated-By-Lightning-Muhyos-Bureau-S2E6-1200.jpg\"/></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bellocent has already wreaked havoc inside the academy, attacking several weaker students and engaging in a battle with Roji’s crew. With these students occupied on the inside and those on the outside trying to break in to save them, this creates a perfect distraction that forces a lot of association members to that one area.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conveniently, while they’re preoccupied with this mission, Teeki strikes. He infiltrates a building from the roof, entering a building with a room that is protected by a magic barrier. While touching it triggers a reaction, Teeki approaches it and sticks a hand through to the other side. By going through this barrier, Teeki is able to grab a forbidden <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bakemonogatari-manga-differences-light-novels-anime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">book </a>that seems to share a personal connection with him. After this relatively easy break-in, Teeki flees the scene with this special book.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hunter-x-hunter-gon-killua-not-rivals-better-for-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hunter X Hunter: Gon &#38; Killua Aren't Rivals - and Are Better for It</a></span></p><p>It seems fairly likely that the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/muhyo-rojis-bureau-bellocent-met-his-match/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bellocent attack </a>was coordinated with Enchu's group. Even if they didn't speak with Bellocent directly, they could have had knowledge of Bellocent's escape attempt. After all, the theft of this book occurs at the right time where everyone else is distracted.</p><p>This wouldn't be the first time that they carried out a scheme using other spirits. The arc where Muhyo and Roji entered a spirit containment center and fought an unrestrained Sophie was orchestrated by Enchu and Teeki, who waited in the background to see if Sophie could actually kill them. When this plan ended in failure, Teeki was able to use all the detained spirits in order to create a monstrous amalgamation.</p><p>The speculation regarding the situation surrounding this scheme only leaves the question of what they are planning to use it for. It's very clear that Enchu has his gripes with the Magic Association, and now that Teeki has this book he will likely be able to draw on stronger forces using it. With this loss, members of the Magic Association are going to have an even rougher time handling Enchu's dark magic users.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/certain-scientific-railgun-t-episode-19-unlikely-friendship-develops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Certain Scientific Railgun T: An Unlikely Friendship Develops</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:45:23 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Teeki-Breaking-Through-Seal-Protection-Muhyos-Bureau-S2E7-1200.jpg","linkMd5":"8451ac7051c5af9f8b4e408c29967408","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-11-328_1dda404dc0e5524b.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":52542,"destBytes":52542,"author":"Michael Collado","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Teeki-Breaking-Through-Seal-Protection-Muhyos-Bureau-S2E7-1200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-11-328_1dda404dc0e5524b.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Teeki-Illuminated-By-Lightning-Muhyos-Bureau-S2E6-1200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn71@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-22-375_83103b9e32bb36b4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389172},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Mass Effect: Andromeda - The Training Classes, Explained | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/mass-effect-andromeda-training-classes-explained/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mass-Effect-Andromedas-training-classes-give-you-a-head-start.jpg\"/></figure><p>BioWare's <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/mass-effect/\">Mass Effect</a> </em>series blends intense action and deep roleplaying, allowing players to choose how they want to play. The games in the original trilogy feature six classes, each of which either specializes in or combines combat, technology and biotic abilities. These classes can drastically affect the way a player experiences <em>Mass Effect, </em>as well as changing which team members work well in a group.</p><p><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda </em>uses a similar system, but the classes are now known as profiles. Rather than being stuck in one class like in previous games, protagonist Ryder can unlock additional profiles and then switch between them during gameplay.</p><p>However, players are asked to choose a training class during character creation, which will determine their abilities and skills for the first several hours of gameplay. For veterans and new players alike, here is a breakdown of <em>Andromeda</em>'s six training classes.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mass-effect-commander-shepard-rachni-queen/\">Mass Effect: How Shepard Decided the Rachni Queen's Fate on Noveria</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-security.png\"/></figure><p><em>Andromeda</em>'s Security training class corresponds to the Soldier class found in previous <em>Mass Effect </em>games. It focuses on the use of weapons, making it the most basic \"third-person shooter\" class as it grants powers to improve Ryder's ability to both dish out and take damage.</p><p>Players who choose Security training won't have tech or biotic abilities to fall back on, so they should take advantage of the Combat Fitness passive ability, which allows them to carry more weapons. The Concussive Shot power is useful for stunning dangerous enemies, while the Turbocharge buff is great for chipping away at a particularly armored opponent.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-biotic.png\"/></figure><p>The Biotic training class corresponds to the Adept profile, which focuses on the use of powerful energy attacks. Biotics are great at controlling the flow of combat, using their powers to disrupt enemy attacks and positions. Throw lets players toss an enemy into the air, leaving them completely exposed to attacks. Singularity also disables enemies, trapping them in a vortex, while Barrier enhances Ryder's armor and makes them much more durable.</p><p>Biotic players should pick their squadmates carefully, choosing characters who will be able to capitalize on the opening created by their powers, and pay attention to enemy movements.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mass-effect-samara-justicar-revealed/\">Mass Effect: The Life of Samara the Justicar, Revealed</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-technician.png\"/></figure><p>Technicians, roughly analogous to Engineers, make for an excellent support system on the battlefield. Their abilities focus almost exclusively on buffing allies and debuffing enemies, meaning their teammates will be doing most of the physical damage.</p><p>The Overload power does tons of damage to shields and synthetics, while Invasion hacks enemies and drastically lowers their defenses. Team Support, meanwhile, increases the entire team's shields. A good Technician should have their eye on their teammates at all times, so they known when best to let those powers loose.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-leader.jpg\"/></figure><p>Leader training sets <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda </em>players on the path of the Sentinel, in a class which combines technology and biotics. Leaders have access to Energy Drain -- a power that replenishes their own shields by draining health from enemies -- as well as Team Support. Annihilation, a biotic power which deals damage to nearby enemies, can also act as a combo primer by dealing massive damage if another biotic power is used at the same time.</p><p>By increasing their squad's shields and setting up powerful combo attacks, the Leader is perhaps the best class for players who enjoy working with their teammates.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mass-effect-the-asari-explained/\">Mass Effect: The Asari, Explained</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-scrapper.png\"/></figure><p>The Scrapper, like the Vanguard class that it unlocks, combines combat and biotic skills to become a close-range powerhouse.</p><p>The Scrapper can use Charge, which turns them into pure energy and sends them slamming into an enemy, to recharge their shields and instantly get in enemies' faces. They also have the Combat Fitness passive ability, which increases their durability and lets them carry additional weapons. Both of these abilities make the Scrapper a perfect fit for players who want to zip around the battlefield and deal some intense close-range damage.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-operative.jpg\"/></figure><p>The final training class is the Operative, which corresponds to the Infiltrator class by mixing tech and combat abilities. The Operative is a stealth class, which uses subterfuge and tactical placement to thrive in combat. Like Security and Scrappers, Operatives also have Combat Fitness, which lets them take more damage and carry more weapons than other classes.</p><p>However, their main tool is Tactical Cloak, a power which allows them to briefly become invisible to enemies and freely reposition themselves on the battlefield. Attacking will instantly break the cloaking effect, but this attack will also gain a large boost in damage, so Operatives should plan their moves accordingly. Operatives make great solo agents, especially when paired with allies who can effectively draw enemy fire.</p><p><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda </em>made a number of changes to the series' typical gameplay, such as adding a jetpack for maneuverability and making each planet its own open-world. The ability to switch freely between different profiles is another big change, and one that allows players to more freely experiment with the game's many options. Still, training classes allow players to determine their abilities early in the game and let them decide what role they want to play in its treacherous battles.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Keep Reading: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mass-effect-jack-mighty-biotic-life-explained/\">Mass Effect: The Life of Jack the Mighty Biotic, Explained</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:15:35 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mass-Effect-Andromedas-training-classes-give-you-a-head-start.jpg","linkMd5":"edccc0d9f6dc7a30febde511cbe7a5c8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-09-352_43044475d73069bf.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":96490,"destBytes":96490,"author":"Thomas McNulty","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mass-Effect-Andromedas-training-classes-give-you-a-head-start.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-09-352_43044475d73069bf.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-security.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-21-111_01b30009ed0d77d2.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-biotic.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-25-330_21871e2eb59a247f.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-technician.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn92@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-31-547_87301b9d4498e6d9.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-leader.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn43@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-21-249_8e3e09c45d7059bc.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-scrapper.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-21-260_0c8dc38ad72e9178.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-andromeda-operative.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-31-693_6c121b71ffc863c3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389182},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Batman: How the Dark Knight Discovered the Three Jokers | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/batman-discovered-three-jokers/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-Three-Jokers-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p>There are a lot of Jokers running around the DC Universe right now. At the moment, the Batman Who Laughs -- a Jokerized Batman -- is trying to rewrite the multiverse in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/dark-nights-death-metal\"><em>Dark Nights: Death Metal</em>,</a> while the standard Joker holds complete control of Gotham City  and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-joker-war-blackest-night/\">its dead</a>, after taking everything away from Batman in \"Joker War.\" Now, even more Jokers are set to invade with the release of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/three-jokers/\">Batman: Three Jokers</a></em> #1, written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jason Fabok.</p><p>After being teased since the final days of the New 52 era, <em>Three Jokers </em>is set to reveal more about the three individuals who have served as the Joker during some of Gotham's most pivotal moments. Since this enigma has remained unanswered for so long, let's look at how Batman even learned that his greatest foe wasn't just one individual.</p><p>This mystery's origin was found in the midst of \"Darkseid War,\" the finale to Geoff Johns and Jason Fabok's <em>Justice League</em> run during the New 52. When the Justice League found themselves embroiled in a war between Darkseid's Apokolips forces and the Anti-Monitor, who was joined by <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/darkseid-daughter-grail-explainer/\">the daughter of Darkseid,</a> the heroes were desperate for answers on how to put an end to this conflict. After being boom-tubed out of battle by Metron, the heroes were unwilling to play<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-new-gods-film/\"> the New God</a>'s usual game of doom-saying warnings and cryptic answers. Using the Lasso of Truth, Wonder Woman learned that the only way to get a clear solution to their problem was to take the Mobius Chair from him. After accomplishing this, the chair nearly departed from them before Batman took a seat on the alien relic and became possessed by it.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/joker-war-batman-arkham-games-cues/\">Joker War Takes TERRIFYING Cues from Batman: Arkham Games</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bat.jpg\"/></figure><p>The Mobius Chair has always served as one of the most powerful items tied to the cosmic side of the DC universe. Since its introduction in Jack Kirby's <em>New Gods</em>, the Mobius-created chair has proven itself to be virtually untouchable to most powers throughout the multiverse. Allowing its user to travel anywhere through time and space, the Mobius Chair has become a source of limitless knowledge and secrets after all of its many travels. Its wielders are transformed upon connecting to the chair, causing them to become callous to those around them.</p><p>After taking a seat, the first question Batman asked was for the name of the man that killed his parents. When the chair provided him with the answer of Joe Chill, which he already knew, Batman then proceeded to ask the Mobius Chair for the identity of the Joker. At first, the answer remained hidden with Batman only expressing disbelief and confusion before returning to the matters at hand. It wasn't until the end of the battle with Darkseid and the Anti-Monitor -- after he gave up the Mobius Chair -- that Batman revealed the answer the chair had given to him. While talking to Hal Jordan within the Batcave, Batman answered that the chair did not respond with a name, but simply said that there were three Jokers.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-three-jokers-artist-fabok-every-variant-cover-process/\">Batman: Three Jokers Artist Breaks Down the Process Behind Every Variant Cover</a></span></p><p><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Three-Jokers.jpg\" /></p><p>As seen in both <em>Justice League</em> and the <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em> one-shot, it seemed that each of these three Jokers was tied to an era of Batman stories. As <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-jason-fabok-reveals-names-dcs-three-jokers/\">Fabok revealed,</a> the first of these is a criminal mastermind whose most similar to the Golden Age Joker. He's joined by the\" Clownish Joker,\" who pulled off ridiculous gags in the Silver Age of Comics. This trio is rounded out by the \"Comedian Joker,\" the psychotic killer from comics like <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em></p><p>During the course of \"Darkseid War\", the members of the Justice League each learned massive secrets about their past and future. However, the revelation of multiple Jokers completely changed the dynamic between Batman and his greatest enemy. Now, he understood that the undertaking of the Joker was never limited to one man. While the Mobius Chair went on to be wielded by characters like Wally West in the lead-up to <em>Death Metal, Three Jokers </em>seems set to answer questions that have puzzled both Batman and DC fans for years.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-three-jokers-ending-massive-effect-dcu-if-dc-allows/\">Batman: Three Jokers' Ending Will Have a MASSIVE Effect on the DCU - If DC Allows It</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 12:20:13 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-Three-Jokers-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"3136bff323e6763573d77bc9e6db2b6a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-10-399_4e9aed5f91d1d2f5.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":213466,"destBytes":173314,"author":"Paul Yang","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-Three-Jokers-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-10-399_4e9aed5f91d1d2f5.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bat.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-31-247_0bdde6f5d1ddc5dd.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Three-Jokers.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-30-793_52775984c174df3b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389184},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"The VERY FIRST What If...?

Stuff like that.</p><p>Today, based on a suggestion from my pal, <a href=\"https://dangermart.blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin Gray</a>, we look at when the first \"What If?\" comic book story debuted.</p><p>At its simplest form, you have to realize that \"What If?\" is one of the fundamental driving forces of all fiction. Pretty much everything that has ever happened in any sort of media has revolved around the idea, \"What If....something?\" For instance, \"What if an alien lands on Earth as a baby and has superpowers?\" \"What if we turned the Shadow into a superhero who likes bats?\" So really, almost EVERY comic book, under a certain theory, would count as a What If? story. But obviously that's not what Martin is looking for here. We're talking about a comic book story where the \"What If...?\" idea is specifically part of the comic in an open fashion.</p><p>Along those lines, then, I would have to discount the frequent usage of the term \"What If?\" in humor comic books, with Mad Magazine's first usage occurring in 1958's Mad #42, \"What If You Did What They Told You On TV?\" </p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mad-42-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>This occurred a lot in humor comics of the era. In this instance (by writers Dee Caruso and Bill Levine and artist Bob Clarke), it was a simple case of imagining what would happen if you actually tried to do the things that they told you to do in commercials. Really basic stuff, but that was the driving force of a number of similar gags in other humor comics from this era (both Mad and its various copycat competitors). Just a general, \"Hey, what if this happened?\" </p><p>So, if you're looking for the first comic book story that actively worked \"What If?\" into the feature, then this would be the answer, but again, I assume we're specifically talking about a comic book where it is an alternate reality centered around asking \"What If?,\" right? </p><p>In other words, something like Archie and Me #9's \"What If?\" by Bob Bolling and Jon D'Agostino, where Mister Weatherbee wonders what it would be like if Archie was his son...</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/archie-and-me-9-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Naturally, it would not have turned out well, and by the end of his wondering about the scenario, Weatherbee keeps thinking of how bad Archie would be as a son that he ends up yelling at Archie for no reason when he next runs into him. That 1966 story would be precisely what Martin is looking for, but sadly (okay, \"sadly\" is a stretch, but when an answer is predictable, it is kind of sad for me), the answer is precisely the story that Martin thought it would be when he wrote in to me. He asked if 1965's Detective Comics #347 was really the first and it looks like it was, in fact, the first \"What If?\" story in comics (where the \"What If?\" suggests an alternate reality story). </p><p>The lead feature in Detective #347 was written by Gardner Fox and drawn by Carmine Infantino and Joe Giella and it dealt with a brand-new villain known as the Bouncer. The Bouncer had an elastic costume that allowed him to bounce all over the place, but he also had weapons made out of the same special elastic material, so he had a gun, for instance, that he could bounce off of a wall and have it fire. </p><p>Batman and Robin, though, realize that if they freeze his costume and his gun, it can remove the elasticity from them both, so when the Bouncer goes to throw his gun to bounce off of a wall and fire on Batman, it instead breaks on the wall and Batman knocks him out cold. That, of course, is how the story OFFICIALLY ended.</p><p>This, though, then led to a special detour where Gardner Fox took readers into his own home and show them his \"What IF?\" room. This is the place where he goes to think about stories that he has just completed and debate how the story could have taken a drastic turn depending on different circumstances. He then decided to show one such alternate scenario to the readers. </p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/detective-comics-347-3.jpg\"/></figure><p>This time around, the Bouncer quickly figured out what Batman and Robin were trying to do. In the original story, Batman stalls him long enough for the freezing effect to take control. Here, though, since the Bouncer cops to their plan, he makes his move sooner, and throws his elastic gun before it can be frozen and it does its trick and it bounces off of the wall and fires upon Batman, killing the Dark Knight in cold blood (but not cold enough to freeze elastic material).</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/detective-comics-347-4.jpg\"/></figure><p>Fox then shows the Justice League come to pay tribute to their fallen comrade and Robin vows revenge on the Bouncer. This time around, since the gun trick worked, the gun was left behind as evidence and Robin was able to experiment on it and discover a way to use elastic fatigue to break down the Bouncer's elasticity in a different fashion. When they fought against each other, Robin was able to win and arrest Batman's killer.</p><p>However, then Batman shows ups...alive! It turns out that the Earth-2 Batman found out about what happened to his Earth-1 counterpart and decided to travel to Earth-1 to take over his fallen counterpart. Earth-2 Batman was older, and nearing retirement on Earth-2 anyways. In addition, Earth-2 Batman brought along Earth-2 Alfred to help cheer Robin up, as Earth-1 Alfred had been killed a year or so earlier. </p><p>The issue ended with readers being asked if they wanted to see more of these \"What If?\" stories. However, soon after this, the Batman TV series debuted, and Fox and the other Batman writers had to spend their time writing stories similar to the TV series and the \"What If...?\" approach was forgotten (or maybe fans wrote in and said they didn't want it. I doubt it, though). </p><p>Thanks for the suggestion, Martin!</p><p>If anyone else has a suggestion for/question about a notable comic book first, drop me a line at brianc@cbr.com!</p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 17:32:49 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-if-batman-display.jpg","linkMd5":"ea99045f1e19176af858aa6936f3071f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-09-341_5fa807c692523f33.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":170564,"destBytes":170564,"author":"Brian Cronin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-if-batman-display.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-09-341_5fa807c692523f33.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mad-42-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-26-980_050436d5d3b487b8.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/archie-and-me-9-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn75@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-29-026_1f77f5ae88e78040.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/detective-comics-347-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-22-923_419aadfd2dc40413.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/detective-comics-347-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn47@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-22-322_6721c7fc9fc5510f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389176},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Horizon Zero Dawn #1: The Carja Hunters Lodge Is in Disarray","link":"https://www.cbr.com/horizon-zero-dawn-carja-hunters-lodge-disarray/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/horizon-zero-dawn-comic.jpg\"/></figure><p><strong>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Titan Comics' <em>Horizon Zero Dawn #1</em> from Anne Toole and Ann Maulina, available now.</strong></p><p>The excitement around the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn/\"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> franchise is at an all-time high. The game's sequel, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, has been <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/sony-horizon-forbidden-west-playstation-5-trailer/\">confirmed for PlayStation 5</a>, and the 2017 original j<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-trailer-release-date/\">ust landed on PC</a>. The franchise is now expanding beyond the realm of games with a run from <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/horizon-zero-dawn-comic-book-adaptation-titan/\">Titan Comics</a>.</p><p>The first issue offers a tantalizing expansion to Horizon's lore, such as one revelation about the Carja Hunters Lodge. While this noble institution once stood tall, we see it somewhat disheveled in issue one.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/horizon-zero-dawn-1-review/\">Horizon Zero Dawn #1 is a Serviceable, if Uneven Continuation of the Game</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HZD1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Central to this new tension is Talanah Khane Padish, the Sunhawk of the Hunters Lodge. The Sunhawk is the leader of the Lodge, a cultural totem that attracts all manner of Carja hunters. Based on tradition, the Hunter's Lodge is a deeply revered and sacred part of Carja culture and history. However, it is also one marred by outdated sensibilities – including bigotry against women. Talanah worked to overturn that and instill progressive sentiments into the Hunters Lodge by winning the position of Sunhawk. She accomplished this with the help of Aloy when the two defeated a domineering Thunderjaw whom the Hunters Lodge dubbed Redmaw.</p><p>This leads us to issue one, where we find Talanah back on the hunt in an attempt to clear her mind the only way she knows how. We learn that she has been training a new generation of hunters, including the headstrong and reckless Kyran. Deeming the Clawstrider too dangerous, Talanah denies Kyran the contract and takes it on herself. After being injured in her fight and nursed back to health by the mysterious Amadis, Talanah sees Kyran attempting the same bounty.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/horizon-zero-dawn-outcast-aloy-title-seeker/\">Horizon Zero Dawn: How the Outcast Aloy Earned the Title of Seeker</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/horizon-zero-dawn-1-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>His disobedience serves as an elegant microcosm for the issues facing the Hunters Lodge. Kyran not only ignored a direct command from the Sunhawk, but he also hired a band of mercenaries to assist him in the felling the beast. Kyran's bungling of the situation continues when he slays the incorrect machine and leaves its corpse behind, an action that put a young boy in danger. The sense of elegance, respect and discipline characteristic of the Hunters Lodge is absent from Kyran's actions.</p><p>With only one issue currently available, it is unclear exactly what the stem of the problem is. However, Amadis alludes to the potential that it is attributed in some part to Talanah being a woman. As the two argue about Kyran's actions, Amadis remarks, \"the Lodge makes you feel special. First woman to join? Yeah, they convinced you it was an honor to sweep up after them.\" Due to the longstanding biases and historical patterns in the Hunters Lodge, Talanah's femininity could be one cause of this tension.</p><p>However, Talanah's courage against Redmaw and her ability to take the position of Sunhawk have shown her unmatched courage and skill. Undoubtedly, future issues will show her regaining control of the Hunters Lodge while coming to terms with her leadership. The Hunters Lodge and the Carja society are some of Horizon's <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/horizon-zero-dawn-lore-reveals-about-sequel/\">most interesting lore elements</a>, and it will be tantalizing to learn more about these as the narrative progresses. We will not have to wait long to see Talanah's story continue, though, as <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> #2 will be available on September 2nd.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/horizon-zero-dawn-hades-supercomputer-explained/\">Horizon Zero Dawn: HADES, the World-Ending Supercomputer, Explained</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 12:15:07 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/horizon-zero-dawn-comic.jpg","linkMd5":"876934f72a24791a6ef1f57989fcb192","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn79@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-09-445_b2c1793270c6d627.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":159386,"destBytes":159386,"author":"Abram Buehner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/horizon-zero-dawn-comic.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn79@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-09-445_b2c1793270c6d627.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HZD1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn27@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-26-983_5ed7fae31233d8d0.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/horizon-zero-dawn-1-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn23@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-28-524_d3c5b3eb10cb5b66.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389184},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Ocarina of Time & Other Titles Rely On Music - But Accessibility Is An Issue","link":"https://www.cbr.com/legend-zelda-ocarina-time-music-accessibility/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zelda-Song.jpg\"/></figure><p>Music has long been a huge and welcome part of video games. From standout soundtracks from games like <em>Journey</em> to rhythm games like <em>Rock Band</em>, there are so many ways that music finds its way into games. A stellar game soundtrack instills a lot of love for classic games and is one of the things gamers can connect to on a deeply emotional level, no matter the genre.</p><p>One of the most interesting ways music is utilized, however, is as a mechanic. <em>Loom</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/legend-of-zelda/\">The Legend of Zelda</a>: Ocarina of Time</em> showcase the wildly interesting yet often unsuccessful and problematic ways that video games have used music as a mechanic.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tales-monkey-island-returns-steam/\">Tales Of Monkey Island Is Back - Here's What You Should Know</a></span></p><p>In 1990, the same year Lucasfilm Games released the well-known <em>Monkey Island</em>, it also released the much smaller and more obscure game, <em>Loom</em>. Set in a fantasy world, <em>Loom </em>tells a lackluster story relying on substantial character knowledge that the player doesn't have a lot of exposition on in the final moments. Where <em>Loom</em> may let players down as a narrative, it offers up an intriguing mechanic for an old-school adventure game. Players might be used to a small vocabulary to define how they can interact with the game world — \"pickup,\" \"walk,\" \"talk,\" etc. — but in <em>Loom,</em> the vocabulary isn't words, but instead small melodies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Loom-Screenshots.jpg\"/></figure><p>Players change the world of <em>Loom</em> by playing these melodies on a magical staff, with lower notes on the left end and higher notes on the right. The four notes that allow them to dye a bunch of wool grass green allows the player to dye a flock of sheep, hiding them from an approaching dragon. Most interestingly, playing the melody in reverse undoes the action; a song that twists up a water spout will untwist it when played in reverse, and one that spins straw into gold can turn a dragon's horde into flammable straw.</p><p>The music in Loom shows a novel way of thinking about how players can interact with the in-game world, but the melodies are unfortunately uninteresting. It may even be a stretch to call the four-note themes \"music.\" It's a fun exploration, but ultimately one that's unsuccessful.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fuser-demo-impressions/\">Fuser Demo: Harmonix's New Rhythm Game Offers Freedom, Music And Corgis</a></span></p><p>Perhaps the most well-known example of music as a mechanic is <em>The Legend of</em> <em>Zelda</em> series. <em>Ocarina of Time </em>is a beloved classic that features many truly novel mechanics beyond just the addition of music. Unlike <em>Loom</em>, though, it also features a lovely and memorable story.</p><p>In addition to wielding a sword and bow, Link brandishes the titular ocarina. While players will solve pathfinding puzzles and fight bosses, part of the game also involves playing the right song at the right time. Some of the songs are just for gaining access to a temple, while others have utility within gameplay, such as summoning a player's horse or freezing undead enemies. The player interacts with the rest of the world much like in other games, though, with the game's verbs of \"walk\" and \"fight\" linked to regular buttons.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/video-game-food-recipe-resources/\">Food For Gamers: The 8 Best Places To Find Video Game Recipes</a></span></p><p><em>Ocarina of Time</em> and other <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games succeed where <em>Loom</em> fails because they add music-playing to the standard game mechanics, rather than replacing them. While this replacement gave <em>Loom</em> a truly novel feel, it also made the game's controls unintuitive and frustrating. Both of these games, however, demonstrate the potential value of using these aural cues as truly integral game components.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina.jpg\"/></figure><p>Linking the mechanics of a game to sound can pose some problems for accessibility. For the deaf and hard of hearing communities, this aspect of the games can be entirely unapproachable. Without accompanying visual cues, sound alone is not a usable mechanic.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/cadence-of-hyrule-give-indie-made-zelda-game-a-chance/\">Cadence Of Hyrule: Why You Should Give This Indie-Made Zelda Game A Chance</a></span></p><p><em>Loom</em> attempts to counter this through the visual component of the music-making staff. Not only are notes located in different physical spaces on the staff, but when clicked, they glow a different color. However, while this may allow players to reproduce a tune based on location or color and not sound, it reduces the melody-based mechanic to visual patterns.</p><p><em>Ocarina of Time</em> tries to make its musical mechanic more accessible than <em>Loom</em>. Notes are presented on a musical staff, but no knowledge of how to formally read music is required. Instead, the notes are color-coded and labeled according to the controller's buttons. Such notation means that the songs in <em>Ocarina of Time</em> can be played even if they can't be heard, but only add additional aural information for players familiar with this notation.</p><p>Experimentation with music as an integral game component presents players and developers alike with a whole new range of interface options and gameplay cues. Yet when implemented without due consideration, it can make games inaccessible. These novel mechanics can make gameplay incredibly interesting, but it's important that they're interesting for everybody.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Keep Reading: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/text-based-adventure-games-modern-world/\">Four Text-Based Adventure Games That Modernize The Genre</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 14:15:23 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zelda-Song.jpg","linkMd5":"edf258945447064ab5b0faf46be96836","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-10-543_ccc6750011a5f496.webp","destWidth":1366,"destHeight":683,"sourceBytes":65176,"destBytes":65176,"author":"E.L.

Because logging into his old account would raise the alarm, the veteran player has to start a new game, and this means (as fans speculated) creating a new avatar. He doesn't waste any time prettying it up: the finished product looks like his old avatar with slightly longer hair and an unfortunate color palette. Then again, Kaburagi clearly isn't one to care about appearances, and all he wants to do is get in contact with Natsume as quickly as possible.</p><p>During his <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/deca-dence-spoiler-makes-the-ultimate-sacrifice-natsumi-kaburagi/\">supposed death</a>, things have gotten worse for the humans of Deca-Dence. The fortress has been overrun with Gadoll, specifically (and suspiciously) targeting the clustered city that the Tankers call home. Kaburagi helps fend the monsters off, but he's a bit clumsy. Understandably, fighting in a different avatar takes a bit of getting used to, even if it seems his skills have transferred over.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lapis-relights-episode-7-maryberry-performance-tiara-orchestra-plan/\">Lapis Re:LIGHTs: Maryberry's Performance Sparks Tiara's Orchestra Plan</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/deca-dence-kaburagi-new-avatar.jpg\"/></figure><p>Thankfully, a Gadoll that slips away from Kaburagi is put down by Natsume, who heroically saves a crowd of Tankers. Natsume appears to be doing just fine without her mentor around, though she's too busy for Kaburagi to confront her right away.</p><p>Before talking to Natsume, Kaburagi decides to pay a visit to Minato, the Deca-Dence Commander in Chief. As suspected, Minato explains that the current Gadoll onslaught is meant to cut back on the Tanker population. Apparently, the Tankers are expanding too quickly, and Solid Quake is using the Gadoll as a means to make the fortress more manageable. Minato doesn't have a problem with this, and he doesn't understand why Kaburgai cares about the lives of humans. However, he's also the reason Kaburagi wasn't scrapped after rebelling, so he's a good guy deep down.</p><p>Meanwhile, Natsume is doing it all. She fights off the invading Gadoll, comes up with ideas to patch up the busted fortress and rallies the Tankers into action all before the sun goes down. Kaburagi watches from afar, still (after seven episodes) unable to fathom how Natsume can work so hard in a situation so dire. Eventually, he approaches the girl, though he doesn't let her in on his real identity. He says he was sent by Kaburagi, and the two sit down to talk.</p><p>Kaburagi discovers that Natsume isn't doing too well after all. She's struggling with the pressure and understandably overwhelmed by the situation, which keeps getting worse and worse. With everyone banding together, the Tankers did end up fixing the fortress, but Kaburagi knows the Gadoll attacks will never end. Solid Quake will not let up, dwindling down the Tanker population until they're satisfied. The system is <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/deca-dence-kurenai-stars-in-subterranean-battle/\">unwinnable by design</a>. Not for the first time, reflecting on Nastume's predicament affects Kaburagi greatly. His arm begins to shake with rage. With a roar, the lifetime cynic declares he'll \"tear it all down.\" If the system is broken, anarchy is the only option.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Sword Art Online: Kirito &#38; Vassago FINALLY Face Off in War of Underworld\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/sword-art-online-alicization-war-underworld-episode-18/\">Sword Art Online: Kirito &#38; Vassago FINALLY Face Off In War Of Underworld</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/deca-dence-natsume-kaburagi-sunset.jpg\"/></figure><p>Kaburagi returns to the correctional facility with the goal of destroying the Gadoll factory, which is apparently right above them. Donatello is on board, but it can't be easy. Their fellow inmates laugh at Kaburagi's face, dismissing him from the get-go. For once, Kaburagi doesn't care about <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/former-sao-ally-rescues-heroes-war-of-underworld-episode-17/\">how hopeless it all looks</a> -- he's contracted Natsume's never-say-die attitude, and this means he'll stop at nothing to save the Tankers.</p><p>It feels as if Kaburagi's new game is a fresh start for him in more ways than one. Not only has he shed his old in-game appearance, but also the attitude that previously defined his character. Filled with resolve, it will be interesting to see how he goes about the seemingly impossible task of destroying the system itself.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/rezero-season-2-episode-7-subaru-witch-cult-garfiel/\">Re:Zero: Subaru REEKS of the Witch Cult and Garfiel Isn't Having It</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:45:33 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/deca-dence-kaburagi-episode-7.jpg","linkMd5":"2f4b64def981110628374c1d4b3726f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-11-871_da359df8b417ce82.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":59562,"destBytes":59562,"author":"Maxwell Freedman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/deca-dence-kaburagi-episode-7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-11-871_da359df8b417ce82.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/deca-dence-kaburagi-new-avatar.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-22-581_11dad222b42cc0d5.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/deca-dence-natsume-kaburagi-sunset.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn71@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-26-595_667034ddf9b94922.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389183},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Thor Proves That Thanos Is STILL the Marvel Universe's Endgame","link":"https://www.cbr.com/thor-thanos-marvel-endgame/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Thanos-Thor-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/thor\"><strong>Thor</strong></a><em><strong> #6, by Donny Cates, Nic Klein, Matt Wilson and VC's Joe Sabino, on sale now.</strong></em></p><p>Thanos has always been one of the Marvel Universe's most deadly and destructive threats, and entire teams of heroes regularly have used all their might to prevent his plans.

This has been proven time and time again in the history of the Marvel Universe, with multiple potential futures that have resulted in Thanos wiping out the heroes who've so often stopped him. Jim Starlin, Ron Lim and George Perez's <em>Infinity Gauntlet</em> saw Thanos claim the reality-altering tool and quickly wiping out all opposition, including the last heroes who confronted him. It was only the Gauntlet ending up in the hands of others that all this damage to the universe -- and its heroes -- was undone.</p><p>The impetus of <em>Civil War II</em> -- which saw the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thanos-vision-murder-infinity-gauntlet/\">Avengers</a> using a prediction from the Inhuman Ulysses to ambush Thanos mid-scheme -- kept Thanos from carrying out a plan that would have led to him wiping out half of the Marvel heroes. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thanos-wins-future-king-thanos-intro/\">\"Thanos Wins\"</a> explored a possible future where Thanos did succeed and brutally defeated the heroes during a massive attack on the Earth, eventually becoming the last living being in existence. Even when Thanos had his life altered by a future-Frank Castle, he still killed countless people to achieve a peace he desired for the future, likely including whatever heroes stood in his way.</p><p>These dark ambitions have also stretched beyond comic book universes, with Thanos quickly becoming the overarching villain of the first decade of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although he had reasons for his mission, Thanos still set about bringing the destruction of half of all life in the universe to try and achieve a peaceful future. His ambitions led him to claim the Infinity Stones and to wipe out half of all life -- with the heroes being forced to break the laws of space and time to reclaim them and undo the damage he'd caused.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thor-9-reintroduces-god-of-thunder-human-host-donald-blake/\">Thor #9 Reintroduces The God Of Thunder's Human Host</a></span></p><p>The sheer power of Thanos is only matched by his will, which usually gives him more than enough strength to fight against the heroes of the Marvel Universe. And even though he's dead in the present Marvel Universe, it seems that Thanos is fated to win in the end. After destroying the Black Winter in <em>Thor</em> #6, the Thunder God is forced to witness his final fate at the hands of his otherworldly being. This creates a vision of a broken and defeated world. Bones are strewn across the Earth, and the heroes of the Marvel Universe have been turned into undead ghouls. They follow the command of Thanos - now wielding a mysterious black gauntlet, a stolen Mjolnir, all six of the Infinity Stones and a terrifying grin.</p><p>Even with the Power Cosmic amplifying Thor beyond reason, Thanos is still predicted to be the end of him - and by extension, the last good powers in the Marvel Universe. It seems that no matter what, Thanos is the endgame for the Marvel heroes. No matter what, his future comes into conflict with the heroes - and sets about the end of the heroic age at least, or the universe at worst. Thanos is the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avengers-infinity-war-concept-artist-thanos-bat-creatures/\">true \"endgame\"</a> for the Marvel Universe.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/what-nick-fury-whispered-thor-unworthy/\">Thor: Three Words Hold More Power Over Marvel's Thunder God Than Anything Else</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 09:20:02 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Thanos-Thor-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"873894547e20f4495163cdee615f0f12","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-09-421_a1e3268dcbfb3c6c.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":160376,"destBytes":160376,"author":"Brandon Zachary","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Thanos-Thor-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-09-421_a1e3268dcbfb3c6c.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Thor-6-Thanos-Gauntlets.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-22-609_eaea1f517bfc7fe2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389185},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Fullmetal Alchemist: 5 Times Edward Was Right (& 5 Times He Was Horribly Wrong)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-edward-right-wrong/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/edward-right-and-wrong-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>Fullmetal Alchemist </em>began as the story of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-edward-elric-ways-changed-stayed-same/\">Edward</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-facts-alphonse-elric/\">Alphonse</a> Elric going on a journey to mend their broken bodies and atone for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-edward-alphonses-greatest-sin-explained/\">their sin of human transmutation</a>, but they soon got swept up in a battle for the fate of the entire nation.

Ed climbed into the ventilation shaft to infiltrate the place while Al waited outside. They got little for it, but Ed was, strictly speaking, correct about Laboratory #5 being a critical part of Father's plans and the production of Philosopher's Stones. He also got the chance to meet Envy and Lust, and learn their faces.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Was Wrong: Performing Human Alchemy</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/human-transmutation.jpg' /></figure><p>Alphonse shares the blame equally with Edward for this. As kids, they suffered the loss of their mother Trisha, then decided to create a formula for bringing her back from the dead. They made a pile of raw ingredients for making a human body, then attempted to transmute Trisha's soul.</p><p>Big mistake. The dead cannot come back to life, and what could have equal value as a human soul? There is no way to make this equivalent exchange, and thus human transmutation is forbidden. Both boys lost parts of their bodies, and Ed has blamed himself in particular for all this ever since then.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Was Right: Cracking Tim Marcoh's Code</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tim-Marcoh.jpg' /></figure><p>Dr. Tim Marcoh is the man who developed the Philosopher's Stones for the Amestris military's use, and he has been ridden with guilt ever since.

He and Al struggled for days to decipher it all, but they got a second wind, and Ed helped his brother recreate the original version of Dr. Marcoh's notes at last. It was a brilliant move, but all the same, the Erics were horrified by what they had uncoded.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Was Wrong: Holding Back Against Kimblee</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kimblee-with-red-eyes.jpg' /></figure><p>Later in the story, Ed faced <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-solf-j-kimblee-facts/\">Kimblee</a> in combat in a northern mining town, and Ed was confident about his odds of winning. After all, he had been equipped with lightweight automail that worked well in the cold and he sliced up the transmutation circles on Kimblee's palms.</p><p>The problem is that Kimblee had a Philosopher's Stone on him, and Ed had no way to stop Kimblee from using it &#38; launching a devastating attack.

They would have nothing to return to, so they'd have no choice but to move forward. Or so they thought.</p><p>When Hohenheim returned to Resembool and met Ed again, he pointed out the <em>real </em>reason Ed burned the house down. Ed and Al were deeply ashamed and frightened of what they had done (human transmutation), and were trying to sweep it under the rug. Ed didn't like being corrected like that, but there was no denying Hohenheim's words.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-greed-the-rogue-homunculus-explained/\">Fullmetal Alchemist: Greed, the Rogue Homunculus, Explained</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:30:19 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/edward-right-and-wrong-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"10aee6ee8babf3c0b4d43e71dfc32dcc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-10-905_a3706f06c2377bf8.webp","destWidth":1800,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":65998,"destBytes":65998,"author":"Louis Kemner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/edward-right-and-wrong-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-10-905_a3706f06c2377bf8.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/edward-vs-armor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-27-535_be120df330738671.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/human-transmutation.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-27-583_65b13643a0109504.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tim-Marcoh.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-32-612_31d9b0a6a8e01d02.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kimblee-with-red-eyes.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn72@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-30-661_9f85ea2104fdee2e.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ed-with-winry.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn83@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-23-270_16c7474d95cacc9f.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/edward-vs-scar.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn75@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-29-966_0a0709de290338f9.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gluttony-stomach-portal.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn83@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-32-269_35ca96fe6a70975b.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Full-Metal-Alchemist-Brotherhood-Nina-Tucker-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-22-274_f5763324ea4a0a57.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Roy-Mustang-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-22-729_0e39b1189281d983.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Edward-elric-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn27@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-26-099_074fcafd9fd0d23b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389170},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"The Flash: Sue Dearbon Will Remain in Season 7 Without Ralph","link":"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-sue-dearbon-season-7/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Flash-Season-6-Sue-Dearbon.jpg\"/></figure><p>One of the biggest questions surrounding Hartley Sawyer's firing from <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash-tv/\">The Flash</a> </em>revolved around what the show would do with the character of Sue Dearbon.

He said that keeping Sue around was \"one of the easiest decisions I've ever had to make as a showrunner.\" Wallace added, \"I called up Natalie and said, 'Don't worry, you're still going to be part of this season. We'll find a way.' Now, when I told her that, to be honest, I wasn't quite sure [how]. But I am happy to report we found a way.\"</p><p>Losing Ralph ended up being all the inspiration the writing team needed to give Sue a new arc. Wallace said, \"Now we can expand her character and give her more backstory and more growth in ways that we hadn't initially planned. [It's] really exciting to see how she's going to interact more with Team Flash once her name has been cleared — because we are going to clear her name obviously. But then what's the reason for her to come back to Central City? And that's going to be a bit of her story this season.\" He continued, \"You try to take lemons and make lemonade, and suddenly, now Sue's possibilities are wide open. And we have a particular storyline that she's going to help us out with, [specifically] with one of our villains this season that we would have never gotten to had not the circumstances changed. So it is going to be, I think, fun and unexpected for the audience, as much as it was for us to write.\"</p><p>Back in June, Hartley Sawyer was fired from <em>The Flash </em>after a series of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/flash-hartley-sawyer-fired-racist-misogynistic-tweets/\">racist and misogynistic tweets resurfaced</a>. Because of their marriage in the comics, Sue's plots were often tied to Ralph's in the show, creating a sticky situation for the writers after Sawyer was gone.</p><p>Returning to The CW for Season 7 in 2021, <em>The Flash</em> stars Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Carlos Valdes, Danielle Panabaker, Tom Cavanagh, Jesse L.

Luke Cage: Who Would Win In A Fight?</a></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Luke Cage's first appearance came in the comic named <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/luke-cage/\">Luke Cage</a>, <em>Hero For Hire #1</em> and the character itself was created by George Tuska, John Romita, Archie Goodwin, and Ray Thomas. With the concentration being around Cage's supposed powers, the comics over the years have revealed so much about the Avenger's unbreakable skin. There are so many things the fans need to know about Cage's body and here are a few awesome facts about the same.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>He Wasn't Born With It</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cbr-luke-cage-moment-of-truth-1.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Luke <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-heroes-weird-origin-powers-story/\">would have wanted to be born a superhero, unfortunately, it didn't pan out that way as he has a proper origin story</a>, which is both sad and painful. Born in Harlem, Luke was arrested for doing nothing and he volunteered for a science experiment, which saw a copy of the Super Soldier Serum (the one used on Steve Rogers) being used on him. The experiment took a drastic turn and he developed an unbreakable body, along with the other perks.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>He Is Fast, Really Fast</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Marvel-Luke-Cage-1-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">This <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superhero-comics-silliest-powers-ranked/\">seems to be an underrated power</a> of Luke Cage. The Power Man of Marvel Comics didn't just gain superhuman strength from the serum, his body also became very light and he is someone who can swiftly cover ground. A glimpse of the same can be seen in the Netflix series and in Marvel's The Defenders. Luke literally is able to chase down a truck and he doesn't even break a sweat. It's absolutely incredible the amount of acceleration he can gain for such a big body.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Superhuman Stamina</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Luke-Cage-2.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">With the ability to cover long distances in a short space of time, Luke also has absolutely incredible stamina. It seems like serum adjusted his stamina according to the levels of strength in his body.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"10 Things Marvel Fans Don't Know About Jessica Jones &#38; Luke Cage's Relationship\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-jessica-jones-luke-cage-relationship-facts-trivia/\">10 Things Marvel Fans Don't Know About Jessica Jones &#38; Luke Cage's Relationship</a></span></p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\">He can fight for as long as the opponent wears out or eventually gives up. It's just like Captain America and no wonder why <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-characters-comic-teams-leader/\">Luke seems to have these leadership qualities</a>; he can literally do it all day. In the comics, Luke has stood up for some incredible battles.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Healthy Appetite</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Luke-Cage.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite being super strong, it comes across as a genuine surprise that Luke Cage doesn't have a weird appetite. He eats as much as a normal human being does and so far, he has shown no signs of an extraordinary diet. The reason why it comes across as a surprise is that Luke's body is able to churn out incredible feats of strength, which means the muscles use a lot of energy and hence why he should feel the need to eat food at regular intervals. But it seems like Luke's digestive system works a bit differently</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Superhuman Healing Abilities</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Luke-Cage.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the superhuman strength, stamina, and power weren't enough, Luke Cage also has incredible healing abilities but not at the level of a Wolverine or Deadpool. Instead, he is at a level where his body can heal in days when for a normal human being it should take weeks, at least. While Luke doesn't really suffer from fatal injuries day in day out, whenever he does suffer from dangerous injuries, he is able to get back up on his feet pretty quickly.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>The Delivery Is Important</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Luke-Cage.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even though Luke Cage has <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-healing-factors-marvel-comics-ranked/#:~:text=There%20are%20a%20few%20abilities,far%20quicker%20than%20other%20characters\">a superb healing factor in his body</a>, that doesn't make him immune to every type of poison present in the universe. Also, it depends heavily on the fact that from where the poison is getting into his body. If it's through his chest, biceps, or even wrist, chances are they will not affect him. It's really very hard to pin down the Power Man but if one is really careful, then he/she can succeed, with the emphasis on the word success.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Energy Blasts Need To Be Good</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Luke-Cage-Mighty-Avengers.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">Luke Cage's unbreakable skin is so good that most kinds of energy blasts don't end up doing anything to him. They just tickle him, quite literally, and even Iron Man has struggled to do anything to him through his renowned energy blasts.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"5 Times Mike Colter's Luke Cage Was Comics Accurate (&#38; 5 Times He Wasn't)\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/luke-cage-mike-colter-comics-accuracy/\">5 Times Mike Colter's Luke Cage Was Comics Accurate (&#38; 5 Times He Wasn't)</a></span></p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-the-crew-every-team-member/\">In one comic representing The Crew, Luke came up against Hydra and they tried to blast him off using a rocket launcher</a>. And guess what, when the rocket landed, everything in and around the area got destroyed but there was Luke standing tall like nothing even happened.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Lasers Can Affect Him</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Luke-Cage.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">Luke's outer body is like an armor that protects his organs but if someone can find a way to break through the body without actually tearing him apart then something can definitely happen. That's where these small yet powerful lasers come into play because they can cause damage to Cage's internal body structure. Like if a powerful beam of X-Ray is used on him, maybe some of his organs might start failing. But in order to reach that far, one has to trick Cage which is easier said than done.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>His Head Is His Biggest Weakness</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/luke-cage-dab.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">If there's any part of Luke Cage's body that is vulnerable to a simple blow is his head because a blunt trauma to his head can affect him as <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-underrated-overrated-stories-events/\">seen in Marvel's The Defenders story arc</a> when Elektra is able to leave him unconscious by landing a blow to his head. Concussions can have a huge effect on Cage as it does to many other superheroes, even Thanos who pretty much told Thor that he should have gone for the head.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Vulnerable To Wolverine's Claws</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Marvel-Comics-Luke-Cage.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-wolverine-common-misconceptions/\">Wolverine's claws are made out of Adamantium</a>, so it can be said that Luke Cage's body can be penetrated by using this fictional metal alloy that is found in the Marvel Universe. Over the years, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/Wolverine/\">Wolverine</a>'s claws have broken through the likes of Hulk, so it wouldn't surprise anyone if it has the same effects on Cage. It would be really interesting to note that Cage might be open to infections if he suffers a clean blow but that doesn't happen very often.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"5 Luke Cage Costumes That We Love (&#38; 5 That We Don't)\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/luke-cage-marvel-best-worst-outfits/\">5 Luke Cage Costumes That We Love (&#38; 5 That We Don't)</a></span></p></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:30:30 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Marvel-Luke-Cage-1-Cropped.jpg","linkMd5":"17390ba2d6afef1c0b109d9a8e31fb85","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn19@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-11-981_c8e1dbb531eb12ba.webp","destWidth":1820,"destHeight":910,"sourceBytes":163074,"destBytes":163074,"author":"Nishid Motwani","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Marvel-Luke-Cage-1-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn19@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-11-981_c8e1dbb531eb12ba.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cbr-luke-cage-moment-of-truth-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn59@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-24-661_abe01e60cf168acd.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Luke-Cage-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn66@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-21-266_385a70001cb733a5.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Luke-Cage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-24-916_9ceff94c611e2e27.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Luke-Cage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn28@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-31-983_429ed7e010c9616f.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Luke-Cage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn63@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-26-451_3b9ec39e8939bb57.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Luke-Cage-Mighty-Avengers.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn96@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-26-645_15af0f4096410b64.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Luke-Cage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-35-667_127939b47a1974b8.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/luke-cage-dab.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn15@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-25-913_9d11bd4626f779d0.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Marvel-Comics-Luke-Cage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-23-285_6f9a7d22eff9a907.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389170},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Berserk: 5 Things That Make No Sense About The Show (& 5 Fan Theories That Do)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-anime-manga-no-sense-fan-theories/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Berserk-Fan-Theories-No-Sense.jpg\"/></figure><p>Kentaro Miura's award-winning and well-loved action Seinen manga <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/berserk/\">Berserk</a> </em>has not only made huge impressions on the people who have come in contact with it, but it also kind of stumped them on a lot as well. The manga prominently features a lot of complex themes and lore that, even with a very close reading of it, can be baffling.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-guts-versus-anime-characters-win-lose/\">5 Characters From Anime Guts Could Beat (&#38; 5 He Can't)</a></span></p><p>Aside from that, there are many mysteries that Miura has left unsolved in part thanks to his habitual long hiatuses and noticeably slowed output. Here's a look into some things that don't make sense yet, and some fan theories about <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/kentaro-miuras-8-best-works-that-arent-berserk-ranked/\">Kentaro Miura's magnum opus</a> that may help us to figure them out.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>MAKES NO SENSE: What Exactly Is A Behelit?</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/behelit-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>From what's shown, a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-apostles-little-know-trivia/\">Behelit</a> is perhaps some weird sort of baby head or something, right? Well, not really. But that description is <em>kind of</em> correct, right? In <em>Berserk</em>, the Behelit is a supernatural item that provides otherworldly power to its. That is, if they know how to use it.</p><p>We see Behelits used multiple times, once by Griffith and by a host of other antagonists who become Apostles. It allows one to make a wish, provided the God Hand -- ethereal beings straight out of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hellraiser-remake-production-hell/\">Hellraiser</a> --</em> decides it's a worthy cause. We know how they work, but who made them and why?

While Miura has said in interviews he can't give a series as dark as <em>Berserk</em> a bad ending, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's fated for Guts or Griffith to automatically win or lose.</p><p>Although Griffith has achieved his dream -- a major event that gives fate's existence credence -- Guts' vengeance is nigh, even with the entirety of existence against him. Either Guts' reckoning proves that destiny is false or, at the very least, he's actively defying it.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>MAKES NO SENSE: Is The Demon Child Really Gone?</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/demon-child-berserk-1.jpg' /></figure><p>There's sort of a specter haunting the background of the main characters in <em>Berserk</em>. This specter is misshapen, frail, and ugly. That isn't an insult or anything, but perhaps that gives us a hint at who or what exactly it is.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-guts-worst-things-happened/\">Berserk: 10 Of The Worst Things That Happened To Guts</a></span></p><p>It's revealed that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-guts-versus-anime-characters-win-lose/\">Guts </a>is father to the Demon Child (as named in the manga) that Casca prematurely gave birth to, though it was corrupted by Femto (Griffith's Godhand form) during the Eclipse. The Demon Child later becomes Griffith's new corporeal form, but is this the last fans have seen of it? What else does it have in store for the plot, since its influence can be felt even after its supposed sacrifice?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>FAN THEORY: The Demon Child Will Be Instrumental In Griffith's Downfall</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/griffiths-downfall.jpg' /></figure><p>Skull Knight confirmed that the Demon Child is evil, despite being the offspring of Guts and Casca. The child was intended to be the vessel for Femto to incarnate in the material world after Griffith forced himself upon Casca, but he merely corrupted a child that was already there.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the Demon Child is (technically) the new Griffith, which is why it makes sense that it would hurt him in the long run -- especially since it can subtly influence him, like how Griffith has a strange urge to protect Casca that he couldn't explain. Perhaps Griffith's downfall will take place when distracted in battle by <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-dc-superheroes-vs-guts/\">Guts</a>, and Casca will have her revenge since the child (living in Griffith) is unable to harm her.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>MAKES NO SENSE: Is Skull Knight A Friend Or Foe?</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/skull-knight-1.jpg' /></figure><p>There's something about <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-skull-knight-facts/\">Skull Knight</a> that we can't quite put our finger on. Not only does he look fairly demonic but Guts has had more than a couple of hostile run-ins with him, even though Skull Knight has generally been disarming and portrayed himself as an ally. But is he really a friend?</p><p>Skull Knight did help Guts get the Berserker armor and everything, after showing him where to go and providing him a sense of direction. That being said, he's not a normal human and he seems to have beef with Zodd. While Zodd is most likely all enemy, is Skull Knight manipulating Guts and using him for his own plans, or are his feelings sincere?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>FAN THEORY: Skull Knight Is Supreme King Gaiseric</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gaiseric.jpg' /></figure><p>Gaiseric was the emperor of the first empire that existed in what is now Falconia, and in the middle of these two was Midland. According to the Holy See, Gaiseric imprisoned a sage in a tower and from there, what Griffith did to Guts happens. Gaiseric is visited by four or five angels, the sage sacrifices Gaiseric's entire kingdom, and the sage (supposedly) becomes Void of the God Hand.</p><p>This fan theory states that Gaiseric and Skull Knight being the same person, as Gaiseric wore a skull helmet and was known as the Skull King. We also see Skull Knight attacking Void specifically during the Eclipse, since he has a \"mysterious\" hatred for this specific God Hand member. This one may be bit of a deep lore dive and while it hasn't been spelled out just yet, we're willing to go ahead and accept it as fact.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>MAKES NO SENSE: What's Zodd's Deal?</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zodd-1.jpg' /></figure><p>Zodd, also known as Zodd The Immortal or Nosferatu Zodd, is a rather interesting presence in <em>Berserk</em>. He's been a continuous thorn in Guts' side since early on in the series.

Not only is it not the best at healing people because it merely resets bones and fills cuts up instead of properly fixing the problem, but it also brings Guts closer to losing himself to the dark beast that lurks in him, waiting to consume him and take control.</p><p>This beast may, at the end of the day, be the only thing that can defeat Griffith, but it would also mean <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-guts-worst-things-happened/\">Guts</a> losing himself completely if that's what ends up happening at the end of their eventual clash.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>MAKES NO SENSE: How Does Time Work?</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/time.jpg' /></figure><p>One of the strangest things about the world/s of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/vinland-saga-ways-anime-better-berserk-best/\"><em>Berserk</em> </a>is that while it's already strange that there are three realms (the Astral, Physical and Ideal Worlds) that only begin to overlap once the Eclipse happens, there also isn't a set time period over which the series takes place.</p><p>There are periods where there are time skips but there are also periods where Guts experiences something like \"lost time.\" He spends nights, weeks, months, years wandering and surviving onslaughts of demons, barely aging at all. Additionally, was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/berserk-anime-characters-that-could-defeat-griffith/\">Griffith </a>added to the God Hand or has he always been a part of their plan that transcends time? Was he already Femto before the Eclipse, merely given flesh?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>FAN THEORY: The God Hand Is Using Griffith</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/godhand.jpg' /></figure><p>Void is probably the most important part of the God Hand. This is seen in how Void manipulates events to his accord, with him getting Griffith to emulate Gaiseric both in empire and power for reasons unknown. It would make a lot of sense to assume that with all of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/h-p-lovecraft-and-the-horror-of-comics/\">Lovecraftian</a> themes in the manga, that the God Hand has a certain agenda in mind and is merely using Griffith to achieve it.</p><p>It seems that there is a<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/witcher-3-vs-dark-souls-3-better-game/\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/witcher-3-vs-dark-souls-3-better-game/\">Dark Souls</a>-</em>like cycle at work here. Maybe Griffith is merely a pawn, despite the illusion of true power he found when he became Femto.

He is grim, merciless, juvenile, and carries a bent-baseball bat to knock out people who are emotionally <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/paranoia-agent-creepiest-moments-ranked/\">cornered by their fears</a>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/anime-underrated-psychological-anime-crunchyroll/\">10 Underrated Psychological Anime You Can Watch On Crunchyroll</a></span></p><p>Among various masterpieces like <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/perfect-blue-things-never-knew-anime-movie-trivia-haunting/\">Perfect Blue</a></em> and<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millennium-actress-anime-film-ahead-of-its-time/\"> <em>Millennium Actress</em></a>, the late <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/satoshi-kon-movies-ranked-imdb/\">Satoshi Kon’s</a> <em>Paranoia Agent</em> is a satire of everyday human life. The show has some amazing imagery and symbolism but is often hard for viewers to understand. The symbolism is subtle throughout the series, especially in the fifth episode when both Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa visit Tsukiko in the hospital. There are more scenes and theories that are either too subtle or don't make any sense regarding Lil' Slugger and Tsukiko.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Is Lil' Slugger Really A Hallucination?</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lil-slugger-enters.jpg' /></figure><p>A few episodes into the series and the most obvious clue in the Lil' Slugger case was Tsukiko Sagi. As the first assault victim, Tsukiko was depicted as a delusional person who created a paracosm surrounding her childhood pet dog, Maromi. Both police and media bought into this story of lies and delusions without looking into her mental state.</p><p>If Lil' Slugger was only a character from Tsukiko's childhood trauma, then how were people assaulted by her idea of fear and paranoia?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Makoto Kozuka</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lil-Slugger-arrested.jpg' /></figure><p>When Makoto was arrested by the police, the victims quickly recognized him as the notorious Lil' Slugger. But in the earlier part of the investigation, all of the victims confirmed they never saw their attacker's face. But the police officers never cross-checked the old statements with the new ones.</p><p>How do Makoto and Lil' Slugger share the exact face, height, and skills? Who was copying who? How did Lil' Slugger copy Makoto, when Makoto confessed he was playing the role of a fake Lil' Slugger? Too many questions were left unanswered. Maybe reading the manga would help!</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Makoto's Victims</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Makoto-Paranoia-agent-.jpg' /></figure><p>In episode 5, the imposter Lil' Slugger finally debuts, and his side of the story differs entirely from what viewers have seen in the Lil' Slugger case. Makoto Kozuka is a second-year student from Minami Junior High School who struggles with Chuunibyou syndrome. This rare condition is mostly used to describe the fictional world created by children and teens.</p><p>Makoto is the delusional knight who liberates people by hitting them with his holy sword (er, baseball bat). But how does Makoto find his victims? Both Ushiyama and Hirukawa were emotionally exhausted and Makoto attacked them in the middle of their crisis. If Makoto was able to sense the emotional state of his victims then maybe he was indeed the original Lil' Slugger all along.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>The Death Of Makoto Kozuka</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Giant-Lil-Slugger.jpg' /></figure><p>Satoshi Kon flawlessly convinced viewers into believing in Lil' Slugger's existence. And no information was provided around the fake Shonen batboy, Makoto Kozuka. In episode 5, Makoto was struggling with a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/honest-portrayals-mental-illness-graphic-memoirs/\">mental disorder</a> and in his confession, Makoto called himself \"The Holy Warrior\" who protects people from the evil Gohma.</p><p>In episode 7, after interrogating Makoto for the previous assaults, Maniwa goes out to meet other possible suspects. In the meantime, Makoto dies in the lockup room. It's unclear if Lil' Slugger actually killed him or not. There was nothing in the lockup room that could hurt Makoto, so how did he die?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Origin Of The Shonen Bat</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tsukiko-and-lil-slugger.jpg' /></figure><p>One thing that didn't make any sense is the origin of Lil' Slugger. If Lil' Slugger was created by Tsukiko's past trauma then it shouldn't have assaulted other individuals. It is not clear if suffering from office stress is the same as suffering from a disassociative identity disorder in this story. If Harumi Chōno, Akio Kawazu, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/paranoia-agent-anime-cosplay-identical-characters/\">and other characters</a> were facing different fears then the manifestation of their fears should be different too.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-80s-horror-anime/\">10 Best '80s Horror Anime (According to My Anime List)</a></span></p><p>Lil' Slugger is theoretically the manifestation of Tsukiko’s childhood trauma, not everyone else’s.

But in <em>Paranoia Agent</em>, each of the victims have different fears and insecurities, but their manifestation of fear was the same. Tsukiko was afraid of the next character design and Harumi Chono had a severe mental illness. Akio Kawazu was stressed out due to financial debt and Kamome, Fuyubachi, and Zebra wanted to commit group suicide.</p><p>Lil' Slugger failed to assault some of the most emotionally trapped individuals like Kamome, Fuyubachi, Zebra, Misae Ikari, and the mysterious old man. If it can assault emotionally stressed people then how did it fail to attack these individuals? It's still unclear where Lil' Slugger draws the line.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>The Detective's Instincts Fail</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Makoto-fictional-world.jpg' /></figure><p>In episode 7, Mitsuhiro Maniwa finally discovers the Lil' Slugger assault patterns. He then confirms his theory with Keiichi Ikari but Ikari removes himself from the Lil' Slugger case. But he was the first person who proposed the theory that Tsukiko was lying. It doesn't make any sense if Ikari tries to quit when all they have to do is question Tsukiko again.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/four-essential-satoshi-kon-films-paranoia-agent/\">Four Essential Satoshi Kon Films to Watch After Paranoia Agent</a></span></p><p>Ikari was never diagnosed with any medical condition in the show, nor he was terrified of Lil Slugger's existence. He was one of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/paranoia-agent-smartest-characters-ranked/\">smartest characters</a> in the series, but why did he back off when they were so close to the truth?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>The Unknown Character</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Old-man-from-paranoia-agent.jpg' /></figure><p>In the first episode, an old man writes some formulas in a parking lot in an apparently unconnected scene. Apart from being a catalyst in Mitsuhiro Maniwa's imaginative adventures, the old man didn't have any relevance to Lil' Slugger in this <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/underated-psychological-anime-funimation/\">psychological anime</a>. He was undoubtedly the most unnecessary character in <em>Paranoia Agent</em>.</p><p>He is not the Shonen Bat, nor he is a medieval master as cited by Maniwa. The relationship between the old man and Lil' Slugger is not clear. Interestingly, the old man was always shown as cornered and helpless but Lil' Slugger never attacked him.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Giant Lil' Slugger</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lil-slugger-doenst-make-any-sense.jpg' /></figure><p>In episode 12, Lil' Slugger transforms into a giant monster.

He has an absolute grudge against Shoto's father, a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mha-student-costumes-pro-ready-could-use-work/\">Pro Hero</a> known as Endeavor. While this is a trait that two of them share, when Inasa first meets Shoto, the former is instantly met with the icy (no pun intended) demeanor that the latter is well-known around the school for.</p><p>Luckily, while Inasa quickly developed the same dislike for Shoto that he has against Endeavor, after a while, he was able to apologize.

Shoto and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/my-hero-academia-kyoka-jiro-facts-trivia/\">Kyoka</a> are two of the most popular characters among fans, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they need to have anything to do with one another.</p><p>That being said, if one digs into them a little more as characters, they're both people who wear a mask of being cold and detached from those who are closest to them. Once past their exteriors, they are considerate.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Fan Pick: Tenya Iida</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iida-1.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/my-hero-academia-tenya-iida-facts/\">Tenya Iida</a> and Shoto share a pretty big similarity.

The only issue is that Shoto hates his father, but Iida loves his brother. It's a bit of a big difference in personality.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Likely Pick: Katsuki Bakugo</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bakugo-Cropped-1.jpg' /></figure><p>This one might be another hybrid of both a fan pick and a likely pick, but that's just because <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/my-hero-academia-facts-never-knew-bakugo/\">Bakugo</a> is a pretty popular ship member no matter who he's paired with.</p><p>In the same way that everyone loved Sasuke in <em>Naruto</em> even if he didn't necessarily deserve it, people feel the same way about the hotheaded Bakugo. Maybe if Shoto can go ahead and indulge in his fire side, they could make things work one day.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Fan Pick: Himiko Toga</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/toga.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/my-hero-academia-mha-facts-interesting-trivia-history-himiko-toga/\">Himiko Toga</a> is a pretty evil character. There's no way around that, even though she's also a fan favorite. There's also something that, while it's not likely to actually happen in the universe of the show, could make for a pretty reasonable assumption about their possible romance.

At the moment, nothing concrete has happened between Deku and Ochako.</p><p>Deku, Bakugo, and Shoto are some of the most important protagonists of the show. Shoto and Deku know each other on a much more personal level than Deku and Bakugo, despite the past shared by the latter.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Fan Pick: Ochako Uraraka</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/uraraka.jpg' /></figure><p>A necessary candidate for pretty much any list of ships which includes fan picks, Ochako Uraraka can't go without being mentioned in these conversations. She's a fan favorite in the show, but aside from that, she's just such a kind person!</p><p>Ochako would be a great catch in the future for any character, but perhaps she could also help someone like Shoto work through a lot of his most pressing issues.

The Power Elite has influence on the political stage, and they were even able to frame Captain America for the murder of General Ross. While Steve spent some time in prison for the crime, he was eventually freed by the Daughters of Liberty, a female team of superheroes which includes Misty Knight, Mockingbird, Toni Ho and Steve's longtime girlfriend, Sharon Carter, among others.</p><p>Now, Steve and his two partners, Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes, have gone undercover in a small town controlled by the Power Elite to try and take the organization down. Their target is Selene, who has stolen a piece of Selene's soul. They are fighting to get it back, but the confrontation takes a turn for the worse.</p><p>Luckily, a new Iron Patriot shows up to lend Captain America a helping hand in<em> Captain America</em> #22.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Captain America: Did Marvel Just Introduce the New Howling Commandos?\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/captain-america-new-howling-commandos/\">Captain America: Did Marvel Just Introduce The New Howling Commandos?</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Captain-America-22-Sharon-Carter-Iron-Patriot.jpg\"/></figure><p>In <em>Captain America</em> #22, Steve, Sam and Bucky are locked in a battle against Selene and her mind-controlled men in the small, Power Elite-ruled town of Adamsville, Ohio. The three superheroes take on a whole swarm of enemies on top of Selene, a powerful mutant who uses her abilities to gain the upper hand. Systematically, she knocks out both the Winter Soldier and the Falcon, until Captain America is her only opponent left. Steve gives everything he has in the fight against the mutant, but she proves too powerful.</p><p>She slices him and even bites him before knocking him out. Before she can consume Captain America's soul, a portal opens right above Selene, and a trio of reinforcements arrives in the form of the witch Agatha Harkness, Wakanda's own Shuri and Sharon Carter, who is now wearing the Iron Patriot armor.</p><p>How did Sharon end up with the armor? As Steve, Bucky and Sam fought Selene and the Power Elite, Sharon could do nothing but watch as they took on a dangerous enemy to reclaim her own soul. After all the time spent stuck on the sidelines, Sharon simply decides to take matters into her own hands, to fight for herself and what's rightfully hers. Instead of waiting and planning and letting others fight for her, she opts to get directly involved in the battle.</p><p>Without any sort of superpowers, Sharon is simply no match for the likes of Selene. Thankfully, she had a friend who can lend her the Iron Patriot armor: Dr. Toni Ho.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-star-infinity-stone-powerful-villain/\">Marvel's Most Dangerous Villain Just Became Even MORE Powerful</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/captain-america-iron-patriot-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>The Iron Patriot armor was first worn by Norman Osborn. After the events of <em>Secret Invasion</em>, which saw him emerge as a hero in the public's eye, Norman re-branded S.H.I.E.L.D. and appointed himself as its new leader. Wearing a red, white and blue Iron Man armor, Norman took on the identity of the Iron Patriot as a symbol of strength and belief for the American people.</p><p>Eventually, however, real heroes would come to wear that armor in the name of good: James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes suited up as the Iron Patriot before Toni Ho followed in his footsteps.</p><p>Since Toni is a member of the Daughters of Liberty alongside Sharon Carter, the suit was ready and on hand for Sharon to use. Oh, and the best part?

While games like <em>Guitar Hero</em> brought music rhythm games and Harmonix into the mainstream, the video game company already had a few music-based titles under its belt by 2005.</p><p>A forgotten rhythm game, <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/frequency/\">Frequency</a>,</em> was Harmonix's first attempt in mixing the two mediums. Today, <em>Frequency</em> has fallen into obscurity, even though it laid the groundwork for many popular music games people love today.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/haunting-ground-disturbing-ps2-game/\">Haunting Ground: The Most Disturbing PS2 Game You've Never Played</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/frequency-2.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>Frequency</em> debuted on the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/playstation/\">PlayStation</a> 2 in 2001. The game had an extremely original concept that many viewed as experimental at the time: players were thrown into a psychedelic musical tunnel in the shape of an octagon, where every segment of the octagon represented specific musical instruments and button commands. Each section threw elaborate button sequences players would need to mimic with their controller. These button commands would turn into instrumental melodies once the player matched the commands with the correct pattern, and they would have to perform each button command with every section within the tunnel to create a song. Players would unlock new songs (which represent the levels) by completing every section of the octagon correctly.</p><p>Harmonix somehow managed to get big-name bands and musicians of the time to lend their music to <em>Frequency</em>. Bands like No Doubt and Fear Factory, along with DJs such as Paul Oakenfold and The Crystal Method, all agreed to put their music in the game. This was a huge selling point for <em>Frequency,</em> with many gamers looking forward to the experimental title. Some musical acts even made exclusive tracks for the game, exciting music and video game fans alike. <em>Frequency</em> was so abstract that people couldn't help but become obsessed with the games obscure premise.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2-best-in-series/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 Is The Best Game in The Series - Here's Why</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/frequency-gameplay-ps2-image.jpg\"/></figure><p>While <em>Frequency</em> enjoyed some success, it didn't achieve the legendary status <em>Guitar Hero</em> did a few years later. The game was very ahead of its time and flew over the heads of many video game fans. <em>Frequency</em>'s unconventional gameplay mechanics and trippy nature may have turned off casual gamers. Still, it did sell well enough to warrant a sequel, <em>Amplitude,</em> which focused more on rock music instead of EDM. Despite positive word of mouth, the series became an underground hit instead of a mainstream blockbuster.</p><p>Although <em>Frequency</em> didn't sell as well as Harmonix would have liked, the game did set the groundwork for its future games like <em>Guitar Hero</em> and <em>Rock Band</em>. There is a good chance that these iconic franchises wouldn't exist if it weren't for <em>Frequency</em>. The title's experimental gameplay was a little too avant-garde at the time but would become accepted after <em>Guitar Hero</em> improved upon its core foundation. <em>Frequency</em> still holds up today and gives gamers a primitive look at <em>Guitar Hero'</em>s gameplay structure. Even though <em>Frequency</em> is inferior to most modern music rhythm games, it is still worth checking out just to see how far the genre has come.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/rival-schools-forgotten-capcom-fighter-explained/\">Rival Schools: The Beloved Fighter That Capcom Forgot About, Explained</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:15:43 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Frequency.jpg","linkMd5":"950c6f20ac1230ab821642aeacb6061c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-09-284_4c55d7e71b901af2.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":96902,"destBytes":96902,"author":"Zack Millsap","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Frequency.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-09-284_4c55d7e71b901af2.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/frequency-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn39@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-24-491_726e5987cf151c2e.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/frequency-gameplay-ps2-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-22-267_fd55fc137224c27f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389179},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Gotham Knights: Why Batman Should Be the Game's TRUE Villain","link":"https://www.cbr.com/gotham-knights-batman-should-be-villain/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gotham-knights-heroes.jpg\"/></figure><p>Debuting at DC FanDome, the upcoming <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/batman\">Batman</a> video game,<em> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/gotham-knights/\">Gotham Knights</a></em>, will feature four playable characters.

One way they've imposed their will on the city is through their foot soldiers, the Talons. Batman becoming one of them would be a bold move, but not unprecedented in the source material: They've recruited from the Bat-Family before.</p><p>After Batman discovered the Court in the comics, he faced off with the Talons for the first time. He was nearly defeated by Talon William Cobb, who claimed to have killed many members of the Wayne family. Cobb also turned out to be Dick Grayson's great-grandfather. Cobb felt betrayed by Grayson's membership in the Bat-Family because he intended for him to become a Talon; therefore, he vowed to kill his great-grandson.</p><p>A battle between the two happened in the 2012 crossover \"Night of the Owls,\" which had the entire Bat-Family fighting Talons. <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/nightwing\">Nightwing</a> was able to outsmart his murderous ancestor and freeze him, putting him out of commission for a time.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/gotham-knights-gameplay-batgirl-red-robin-mr-freeze/\">Gotham Knights Gameplay Footage Pits Batgirl and Red Robin Against Mr. Freeze</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nightwing-Dick-Grayson-Talon.jpg\"/></figure><p>Grayson avoided becoming a Talon during his first encounter with the Court, but he was eventually blackmailed into becoming one when the Court planted a bomb inside Damian Wayne. Nightwing also became a Talon during his days as the amnesiac Ric Grayson, when Cobb was able to hypnotize him into the role.</p><p>Beyond being a good nod to the source material, the Talons recruiting from the Bat-Family would be consistent with what <em>Gotham Knight</em> represents for the franchise. A new generation of protectors having to step up in Batman's absence is a novel idea. Gamers played the vast majority of the <em>Arkham</em> series as a Batman who worked alone.</p><p>Putting players in control of Batman's allies and utilizing co-op as a core mechanic shakes things up considerably. The Bat-Family will have to work together with the whole city against them, including the police -- whom Batman warns his proteges not to trust after Jim Gordon dies.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"http://cbr.com/dc-fandome-every-trailer-teaser-released-event/\">DC FanDome: Every Trailer &#38; Teaser Released at the Digital Event</a></span></p><p>With the Bat-Family already fighting overwhelming odds, adding a corrupted version of their mentor to the mix would really raise the stakes of their mission. Having to fight to save Gotham and free Batman from the clutches of the Court would make their victory at the end of the game more impressive and open the door for Batman to be involved in future DLC or a sequel.</p><p>It would also be a huge shock for players who've spent so much time playing as the Caped Crusader over the years. Batman has been the central hero of  the <em>Arkham </em>and <em><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/injustice\">Injustice</a> </em>games, taking on his rogues gallery and the corrupted heroes of the <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/justice-league\">Justice League</a>. To see him turn evil and have to fight him could be an unforgettable gameplay experience, if done right.</p><p>WB Montreal has promised there's <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/gotham-knights-game-everything-we-know/\">more mystery</a> to <em>Gotham Knights</em> beyond the Owls appearance. Batman's fate, whether he becomes a Talon or not, will likely be part of that. Batman as a member of the Court would be a huge challenge for the Bat-Family and players alike. It would help this new generation of Batman games come into its own and break out of the <em>Arkham</em> series' shadow.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Keep Reading: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-shares-universe-batman-arkham-games/\">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Shares a Universe With the Batman: Arkham Games</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 10:15:23 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gotham-knights-heroes.jpg","linkMd5":"a05cc83fd1b20dddae969c2af101b8e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-09-347_d0b478ca9359a16f.webp","destWidth":1599,"destHeight":799,"sourceBytes":128060,"destBytes":128060,"author":"Robert Curran","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gotham-knights-heroes.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-09-347_d0b478ca9359a16f.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gotham-Knights-Court-of-Owls-talon-reveal.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-32-566_f5d02b2501847d6d.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nightwing-Dick-Grayson-Talon.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-28-654_f30e576b948d1514.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389185},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Captain America’s Biggest Endgame Moment Pales Compared to...

Its enchantment states that the hammer can only be lifted by those who are \"worthy.\" Yet worthiness is pretty vague when it comes <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thor-thanos-mjolnir-infinity-upgrades/\">to those who can</a> and cannot lift Mjolnir. Recently, Mjolnir's ambiguous enchantment may have been made a little clearer by none other than Fred Rogers.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByTwistwood\">Canadian illustrator Twistwood</a> shared a tweet in March 2019 adapting Matthew Wisner's script, depicting an interaction between Mr. Rogers and Thor, into a comic. In the comic, Mr. Rogers inquires into the heaviness of Thor's hammer, and before the thunder god can blink, Rogers is lifting Mjolnir himself. Mr. Rogers then muses on how objects can be heavier for some individuals than others, since everyone is different and special in their own ways. In fact, those that may not be able to lift Mjolnir might be able to do other things that Thor cannot.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/what-nick-fury-whispered-thor-unworthy/\">Thor: Three Words Hold More Power Over Marvel's Thunder God Than Anything Else</a></span></p><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/ByTwistwood/status/1109936608122454020\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>Mr. Rogers' wholesome words provoke much thought around who is worthy of wielding Mjolnir. Clearly Odin, who was present for Mjolnir's creation and enchantment, is able to wield the mighty hammer. Additionally, Bor, Thor's grandfather, has held Mjolnir as well.</p><p>Outside of Thor's family, however, the first person to wield Mjolnir was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thor-beta-ray-bill-got-weirder-and-powerful/\">Beta Ray Bill</a>, in <em>The Mighty Thor </em>#337 by Walter Simonson. Bill is an alien being who befriended Thor at the beginning of Simonson's legendary <em>Thor</em> run. Thor and Bill bonded over their worthiness and the Asgardians even forged Bill his own hammer, Stormbreaker.</p><p>Several Marvel heroes have lifted Mjolnir as well. Most prominently, Thor's fellow Avenger, <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/captain-america\">Captain America</a>, has wielded the hammer on several occasions. Cap's worthiness, combined with his iconic leadership and soldier's attitude, created a unique bond between Thor and the Sentinel of Liberty.</p><p>The mantle of Thor has also been held by Eric Masterson, a construction worker who Odin merged with Thor. Masterson acted as Thor until the two were separated once again, eventually becoming the hero known as Thunderstrike. Additionally, when Thor became unworthy at the end of Jason Aaron's <em><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/original-sin\">Original Sin</a></em>, Mjolnir was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/how-jane-foster-became-the-mighty-thor/\">claimed by Jane Foster</a>. Jane was the nurse of Dr. Donald Blake, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thor-9-reintroduces-god-of-thunder-human-host-donald-blake/\">Thor's original human host</a>. As Thor, Foster reminded the Odinson what it meant to be worthy.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/why-jane-foster-more-worthy-than-thor/\">Why Jane Foster Is More Worthy Than Thor Odinson</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Thor-Jane-Foster.jpg\"/></figure><p>Some characters outside of the Marvel Universe have also been worthy of Mjolnir. In <em>Marvel vs. DC </em>#2, <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/wonder-woman\">Wonder Woman</a> encountered Thor's enchanted hammer. The Amazonian princess was startled to find herself able to wield Mjolnir, briefly commanding Thor's power. In <em>JLA/Avengers </em>#4, by Kurt Busiek and George Perez, <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/superman\">Superman </a>was also briefly able to lift Mjolnir. During a massive battle, Thor momentarily lifted the hammer's enchantment, enabling the Man of Steel to wield its power.</p><p>Instances of characters outside of the Marvel Universe wielding Mjolnir are generally non-canon. For this reason, current <em>Thor</em> writer <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mister-rogers-worthy-mjolnir-donny-cates-thor-fan-comic-marvel-canon/\">Donny Cates' response to Twistwood's comic</a> is pretty astounding. In a tweet on Aug. 16, Cates simply stated, \"This is now officially canon.\" This response was clearly a lighthearted display of appreciation for the comic. Yet, canonizing Mr. Rogers' worthiness adds an extra dimension to Mjolnir's enchantment.</p><p>While some characters like Captain America or Wonder Woman share Thor's ability to carry Mjolnir, the weight of the hammer may be more difficult for characters like Superman. Still, those who are unworthy may possess abilities that the worthy do not, explaining why many iconic heroes are unworthy of lifting Mjolnir.</p><p>The wholesome nature of Mr. Rogers' worthiness adds a sense of comfort to Mjolnir's enchantment.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thor-butchered-marvel-god-galactus/\">Thor Just BUTCHERED One of Marvel's Most Powerful Gods</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 03:30:50 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mister-rogers-thor.jpg","linkMd5":"5c35f0b3c118a285fec6eea70dec0f34","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-10-680_32a4c78ff830b923.webp","destWidth":1500,"destHeight":750,"sourceBytes":155982,"destBytes":155982,"author":"Nabeel Gaber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mister-rogers-thor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-10-680_32a4c78ff830b923.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Thor-Jane-Foster.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-21-106_a571b3fe49c1aae6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389186},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"10 Things Psycho-Pass Does Better Than Other Cyberpunk Anime","link":"https://www.cbr.com/psycho-pass-reasons-better-other-cyberpunk-anime/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-Things-Psycho-Pass-Does-Better-Than-Other-Cyberpunk-Anime-featured-image.jpg\"/></figure><p>Bright pink and blue neon lights.

Akane very much feels like a naive early 20s adult who is learning to grasp the basics of the Ministry of Welfare's Public Safety Bureau (MWPSB) as she is thrust into new situations fresh out of her Sibyl career assessment and subsequent schooling.</p><p>This is in harsh contrast to Kusanagi's character, specifically in the 1995 movie of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ghost-in-the-shell-best-vs-worst-cyberpunk-anime/\">Ghost In The Shell</a></em>. Kusanagi struggles to identify herself, being human born, with the functions and behavioral inclinations of humanity as a whole.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Its Dystopic Leanings Are In A Creative New Direction</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/psycho-pass-brains.jpg' /></figure><p>The cruxes of many plots within cyberpunk media rely on being <em>just</em> futuristic enough to follow the automation of the late 20th century workplaces to fully automized endpoints. To a lesser degree, they explore how that would heighten and change the nature of corruption inside governments to very anarcho-capitalist endpoints, in accordance with the author's views.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/anime-science-fiction-scifi-hilarious-dark/\">5 Sci-Fi Anime That Are Hilarious (&#38; 5 That Are Really Dark)</a></span></p><p>However, <em>Psycho-Pass</em> as a concept chooses to focus on the direct convergence of automation and how the nature of governing a civilian body is handled in a far-future perspective. This includes how an individual is tasked with social responsibility (formerly \"jobs\" and \"careers\") and how crime is prosecuted. A major theme of this show is the offloading of these responsibilities from the civilian population almost entirely, and the growing pains from a very rocky implementation.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>It Takes A Risk Using More Fantastical Future-Tech</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/psycho-pass-dominator-lethal-eliminator-mode-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>The Dominator hue-assessment gun is the 2nd most important tech from the show.

The Sibyl System prefers to keep the latter unclouded and performing checks on the mental state and current wills of said Enforcers as their main task. The Sibyl System itself is what decides almost everything about a person's propensity for in day to day life, including assessments as a \"latent criminal,\" as well as different career leanings a person may have.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>It's Just As Much Of A Psychological-Thriller</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Psycho-Pass.jpg' /></figure><p>Contrary to sweeping shots of a strictly 1980s envisioning of a future taking place in the <em>now</em> current day, positing philosophical questions about AI and sentience, <em>Psycho-Pass</em> is more interested in providing a psychological thriller story about how MWPSB members working under the Sibyl System tackle crime.</p><p>This show shows how some learn to skirt the bounds of the system in new forms of organized crime. <em>Psycho-Pass </em>highlights how members of the MWPSB (namely Shinya Kogami) are affected personally, instead of posing questions of AI's ability to become sentient, an idea more commonplace in other entries of the genre.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>It's More Of A Crime Drama Than A Cyberpunk Anime</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crime-coefficient-execution-status-psycho-pass-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/psycho-pass-times-shogo-makishima-was-right-vs-wrong-comparison/\">Shinya Kogami's backstory</a> may be among the most gripping pieces of this universe's story.

It also tackles the current political division of how an authoritarian style of policing <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/psycho-pass-things-from-this-future-want-dont-want-alternate-reality-anime-dystopia/\">should be implemented</a>, and how many freedoms and rights a civilian body is willing to give up for peace of mind.</p><p>As far-flung into the future with the technological backdrop and metaphors as this anime might be, this cuts to the heart of proposed issues of crime in society.

In fact, that is the core to understanding the motivations of each of the main characters in the show.</p><p>While the <em>true</em> inner functions of the Sibyl System are kept hidden until the latter third of <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, the guiding narrative functions by bringing viewers along with different Inspectors and Enforcers. The characters face moral dilemmas of a futuristic police force's function in executing the will and decisions of the Sibyl System and its assessments of Crime Coefficients and \"hues\" of various civilians in the show.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>It Adds A Splash Of Horror To It All</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/psycho-pass-akane.jpg' /></figure><p>For the lighter notes of the show (like Akane and Masaoka going through CommuField cosplay meetups for information), there are also <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/psycho-pass-most-sadistic-villains-ranked/\">rather gruesome ones</a>. An example being when Akane is cornered into disbelief when a clear criminal kidnaps her friend and threatens to kill her right in front of her eyes, all while her Dominator refuses to allow her to stun or kill the man.</p><p>So Akane really has to watch her friend die. To make matters worse, this case actually requires her to relive those memories while connected to a machine, so that they can put an image of the man's face together.

For anybody itching for combat of a similar vein after beating Jin Sakai's adventure, any of the ten games below may help. They are not all carbon copies, but they generally involve swords, stealth, and reacting to enemy moves with quick timing.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Assassin's Creed II</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/maxresdefault-1.jpg' /></figure><p>The recent PlayStation 4 exclusives draws<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-assassins-creed-fan-art/\"> many comparisons to early <em>Assassin's Creed </em>games</a>, particularly the second numbered entry in the franchise. This is a compliment, since this is where the series hit a stride. Fans have been itching for Ubisoft to tackle feudal Japan since the series' inception, so they are pleased Sucker Punch took the initiative. Like <em>Ghost</em>, the older games' combat is based off of counter-attacks. It is not as refined as the new game, but combat is only a small portion of the franchise.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Dark Souls</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kaathe-abyss-dark-souls.jpg' /></figure><p>FromSoftware crafts some of the most difficult games in the action/adventure genre, so expect a significant challenge when jumping into <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dark-souls-games-action-rpg-franchise/\">10 Games To Play If You Love Dark Souls</a></span></p><p>While both games involve swords, the similarities admittedly do not reach much deeper than that and a focus on blocking. <em>Dark Souls</em> also features more in-depth RPG mechanics and a greater variety of weaponry. The animations also are not as smooth and fighting is slower overall.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Arkham Series</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arkham-knight-gotham.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-batman-quotes-arkham-games/\">Rocksteady's <em>Arkham </em>trilogy</a> takes a relatively simple combo system and gives it renewed depth by increasing the focus on split-second reactions to enemy attacks. When the signal appears on screen, players have barely a moment to counter, lest their combo be broken. This mechanic makes for an addictive combat loop, almost feeling like a rhythm game. A similar desire for continuous counters is in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, as players avoid damage of any kind to fill up the Ghost Meter.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Nioh</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Nioh-2.jpg' /></figure><p>Like <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Nioh</em> will destroy and humble anybody who touches it. The similarities between it and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> says a lot about why Sucker Punch's recent title resonates with so many. It takes the fun parts of many of these critically revered, yet brutally difficult games and makes them more accessible. As a reminder, anybody wanting an increased challenge out of <em>Ghost</em> can always turn up the difficulty to lethal mode.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>For Honor</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/for-honor-header.jpg' /></figure><p>This Ubisoft game came out in 2017 and still receives regular support. Players engage in close-quarters, brutal swordplay with either AI in the single-player mode or with other players. The one on one bouts are incredibly in-depth, requiring the player to select their stance and move set based on opponents' visual cues. Anyone enamored with <em>Ghost of Tsushima's </em>duels owes it to themselves to try out <em>For Honor</em>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-merrin-cal.jpg' /></figure><p>While <em>Ghost of Tsushima's </em>combat borrows ever-so light elements from <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>, <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em> wears the influence far more visibly on its sleeve. Mainstays of the genre like respawning enemies and campfires make their way into one of the<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-fan-created-art-pieces/\"> most critically revered <em>Star Wars</em> games of the generation</a>. Considering samurai films' influence on George Lucas when creating his opus, it only seems right for a game in the franchise to make it on this list.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sekiro-shadows-die-twice.jpg' /></figure><p>Some consider <em>Sekiro</em> to be even more difficult than <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>, making it a truly harrowing experience for those brave enough to confront it. Unlike its brethren, stealth plays a key role in the gameplay, making it even closer to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. One won't be able to take out entire areas stealthily like in the Sucker Punch game, but it does give an upper hand when beginning combat encounters. In a game as tough as this, any assistance helps.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Witcher 3</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Witcher-3-Geralt-Investigating-Monster-Contract.jpg' /></figure><p><em>The Witcher 3</em> is an incredibly massive game. Even five years after release, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/rpgs-you-should-play-after-ff7-remake-final-fantasy-kingdom-hearts-paper-mario/\">few other RPGs hope to match its scope</a>. The combat is not necessarily the weakest part of the game, but it is mostly negligible when compared to the stellar writing and quests.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/witcher-best-cosplay-geralt-of-rivia-yennefer-netflix/\">10 Best Witcher Cosplays You Have To See To Believe</a></span></p><p>However, it certainly gets the job done. Geralt's dance with the blade reminds one of a primitive version of <em>Ghost of Tsushima's </em>combat.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Bloodborne</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bloodborne-hunter.jpg' /></figure><p>Even among the almost universally beloved output of FromSoftware since 2009's <em>Demon's Souls</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em> stands out as a particularly venerated title. The PS4 exclusive smooths out the trademark combat and adds a gun to the mix which can be used to parry attacks if timed correctly. It encourages more aggressive tactics than its contemporaries. Recognizing visual cues from enemies is key to victory, much like in <em>Ghost of Tsushima.</em></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Marvel's Spider-Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Spider-Man-PS4.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-spider-man-ps4s-side-characters/\">Insomniac Games' <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em> was a massive hit upon its 2018 release</a> for how faithfully it captured the iconic comic book character's spirit. The combat makes it onto the list because of its similarities to the <em>Arkham </em>games' combat. Like the <em>Batman</em> trilogy and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, stealth also plays a role in the gameplay, with Spider-Man sometimes having the option to silently web up foes while perched up on high. Unlike <em>Ghost</em>, it is not a moral quandary or internal conflict Peter deals with throughout the course of the game.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next:<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ghost-of-tsushima-beginner-mistakes-you-dont-want-to-make/\"> 10 Beginner Mistakes You Don't Want To Make In Ghost Of Tsushima</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:30:28 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/got-fi.jpg","linkMd5":"916ad574cfcb7aa6d167ffec53b5f7ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-10-321_ca03dc0f14e47611.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":252542,"destBytes":252542,"author":"Jason Wojnar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/got-fi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-10-321_ca03dc0f14e47611.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/maxresdefault-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn80@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-28-241_23fd36b9e6b4fca7.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kaathe-abyss-dark-souls.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-21-169_7600b9fc901fb4da.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arkham-knight-gotham.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-31-151_e305d1d40a107200.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Nioh-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn80@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-31-565_d3c26b1cf532911a.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/for-honor-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-24-906_c962278be3b77a54.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-merrin-cal.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-31-001_c0ef8b1e90444f34.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sekiro-shadows-die-twice.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-21-201_da21f7e22c008e0a.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Witcher-3-Geralt-Investigating-Monster-Contract.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn3@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-26-990_66a0626cd0357394.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bloodborne-hunter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-24-719_212b792d51b90f87.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Spider-Man-PS4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-26-482_b59c8e82d276dee8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389174},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"5 X-Men Villains Who Can Defeat The Justice League (& 5 Who Would Be Defeated By The League)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-villains-vs-justice-league-win-lose-comparison/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/X-Men-Villains-vs-Justice-League.jpg\"/></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Justice-League/\">Justice League</a> is the DC Universe’s premier super-team, comprised of all the heavy hitters like <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Superman/\">Superman</a>, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/Batman/\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Wonder-Woman/\">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/The-Flash/\">The Flash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Green-Lantern/\">Green Lantern</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Aquaman/\">Aquaman</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Martian-Manhunter/\">Martian Manhunter</a>.

This caused the villain to go to New Namek, where he took control of the Dragon Balls and wished himself back to tip-top shape. However, the Namekian Dragon Balls allow for more than just one wish, and Moro's subsequent request was for Porunga to release all of the prisoners held by the Galactic Patrol.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/diary-of-our-days-at-the-breakwater-season-1-episode-7-girls-bonding-time/\">Diary of Our Days at the Breakwater: The Girls Reel in Some Bonding Time</a></span></p><p>These prisoners have generally made up Moro's army and are fierce fighters in their own right, able to wreak a lot of havoc in the name of their master. However, in <em>Dragon Ball Super </em>Chapter 63, their rampage finally comes to an end, even if Moro hasn't yet gone down himself.</p><p>On Earth, Goku and the Z-Fighters have essentially taken down every villain except Moro himself, who is more powerful than ever after absorbing Seven-Three. Using his new powers, Moro was able to defeat the Z-Fighters, but before he could take them down for good, Merus appeared and teleported the heroes away so as to allow Dende to heal them. However, Merus has no intention of defeating Moro. Instead, he's aiming to buy time so that Goku can ascend to the next level and unlock Ultra Instinct for good.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-21-at-10.02.04-PM.png\"/></figure><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/rediscover-how-heavy-are-the-dumbbells-you-lift/\">Now Is the Best Time to Rediscover How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?</a></span></p><p>Merus and Moro go back and forth, with the former breaking all of the jewels on the latter's body that allows him to copy the abilities of others. However, this starts to wipe Merus from existence, as angels are supposed to remain impartial. Merus reveals that, after working with the Galactic Patrol, he came to believe in justice, and he respected their attempts to bring peace to the universe, despite the fact that they're outmatched in terms of power. Rather, the Galactic Patrol is tenacious and will do what it takes to see justice carried out. After that revelation, the chapter shifts focus to the Galactic Patrol, who reveals that they've caught every escaped convict except for Moro. Galactic Bandit Brigade member Yunba is explicitly shown in handcuffs and a cage to underscore the point. As Merus fades from existence, he asks Goku to protect the universe that he has come to love, making clear that he's sacrificing himself so as to give the Saiyan the push he needs to master Ultra Instinct and defeat Moro once and for all.</p><p>The Galactic Patrol haven't been a particularly useful organization in <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, due in large part to the fact that they're hopelessly outmatched by both Moro and the Z-Fighters. However, as the \"Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga\" comes to an end, they've seemingly proven themselves quite useful, as those escaped convicts could have definitely done a lot of damage if allowed to roam free. Plus, they're responsible for inspiring Merus, who is giving Goku the push he needs to become a true defender of the universe. In the end, the Galactic Patrol has proven itself pretty useful, even if it couldn't do much to stop Moro in the first place.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/dragon-ball-super-future-movies-tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dragon Ball Super</a> Chapter 64 releases Sept. 18.</em></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/certain-scientific-railgun-t-episode-19-unlikely-friendship-develops/\">A Certain Scientific Railgun T: An Unlikely Friendship Develops</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 11:45:37 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dragon-ball-super-galactic-patrol.jpg","linkMd5":"941c3e4423c63b5b8219513b7d45c862","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-11-195_47e04e177efc1a81.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":136806,"destBytes":136806,"author":"Liam Nolan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dragon-ball-super-galactic-patrol.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-11-195_47e04e177efc1a81.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-21-at-10.02.04-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn63@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-28-980_2896c4637f346db5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389184},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Haunting of Bly Manor: Hill House's Second Season Debuts Chilling First Photos","link":"https://www.cbr.com/haunting-of-bly-manor-hill-house-second-season-photos/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bly-manor-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>Netflix's <em>Haunted</em> series is back with a first look at photos from Mike Flanagan's latest \"literary remix\": <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-haunting-of-bly-manor/\"><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em></a>.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-haunting-of-hill-house/\">The Haunting of Hill House</a> </em>premiered back in 2018 on Netflix and was met with high regard as a new generation of fans devoured the Shirley Jackson novel turned television series. Flanagan (<em>Doctor Sleep</em>, <em>Gerald’s Game</em>, and <em>Hush</em>) is back with <em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em>, a follow-up to the original series.

And by the end, it’s really hard to differentiate tragedy with romance. That sense of romantic longing for someone who meant so much to us—but who’s gone—really is the heart of any ghost story.\"</p><p>Actors from the original <em>Hill</em> <em>House</em> Crain Family<em> </em>are returning to bring the novella to life, including Henry Thomas (Young Hugh Crain), Victoria Pedretti (Nell Crain), Kate Siegel (Theo Crain) and Oliver Jackson-Cohen (Luke Crain). But that may be the only element of familiarity to viewers. Flanagan claims that the two stories are vastly different, both in structure and ambiance. \"Hill House is described by Shirley Jackson as having this gothic, frightening, shadowy presence. Henry James’s Bly Manor, conversely, is described as being bright and sunny and welcoming and rather beautiful.\"</p><p><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor </em>will premiere on Netflix this fall.

Sometimes reality and comics intersect in weird ways, as what happens in the panels of a comic somehow mirror events in the real world. Though a rare occurrence, there have been historical events happen that first appeared on the comic book pages of both<a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dc/\"> DC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-comics/\">Marvel</a> comics.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/comics-code-creation-superman-55-other/\">Superman #55 &#38; 9 Other Comics That Led To The Creation Of The Comics Code</a></span></p><p>The following events which run the spectrum from<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-doctor-dooms-incredible-science-magic/\"> scientific discovery</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superheroes-overcoming-personal-tragedy/\">tragedy</a>, all happened in the comics before they actually occurred in the real world. When something like this happens, it is uncanny because comics go through a long process before they are available for purchase.

Here, Luthor calls his new invention an \"atomic bomb,\" which in the real world was still being developed by the government, unbeknownst to the writers.</p><p>The Department of Defense found out what the writers were doing and asked DC Comics to delay publishing the issue at a later date. The story goes that the government feared that the Japanese would read the comic and try to build a defense against such a bomb. It was a year later that the world learned of the presence of the atomic bomb. While Luthor's bomb is different from the real one, the government still felt it best to err on the side of caution.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>The Harnessing of Atomic Energy</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Superman-Newspaper-strip-1945.jpg' /></figure><p>Using <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-superman-costumes-suits-best-worst/\">Superman </a>as a predictor of inventions during the nuclear age wasn't contained to comic books, but also occurred in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-the-golden-age-newspaper-dailies-1942-1944/\">Superman strips</a> that ran in newspapers. Months after the mention of an atomic bomb in the comics, one of the ongoing storylines in the 1945 Superman newspaper strip featured a skeptical physics professor blasting the Man of Steel with a particle accelerator. This device was referred to as a cyclotron, which was used to test Superman's supposed invulnerability.</p><p>This storyline was published four months before the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and when the Manhattan Project was at a critical stage. At the time, the US government was censoring anything mentioning atomic energy. The first few installments of this story had already been sent to newspapers across the US by the time the Secret Service contacted the publisher. Even though it was too late to stop the strips, none of the Axis Powers were alerted by the mention of atomic energy.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>The Attack On Pearl Harbor</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pearl-Harbor-National-Comics.jpg' /></figure><p>Before the United States entered World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, a similar event took place in the pages in <em>National Comics </em>#18. <a href=\"https://www.comicbookresources.com/tag/will+eisner\">Will Eisner</a>, one of the creators who <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/comics-superheroes-patriotic-captain-america/\">showed staunch support of the troops</a> during the war, had Uncle Sam fending off an attack on US soil, including one on Pearl Harbor.</p><p>The issue portraying this attack on the Pacific navel base was published in November of 1941, one month before it really happened. The details in the comic book were different, though, as Eisner wrote a German attack on the Pacific Fleet, not a Japanese one. While the players were different, the timing of this comic hitting stands and its parallels to reality are uncanny.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>The Attack On The World Trade Center (DC)</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Adventures-of-Superman-596-World-Trade-Center.jpg' /></figure><p>September 11, 2001 is a day no one can forget, and one no one could have predicted. It was just by pure circumstance that DC Comics predicted a similar event with <em>The Adventures of Superman #596</em>. This issue, set to hit stands on September 12, 2001, was a tie into the DCU event \"Our Worlds At War.\" In the issue \"This Is Not A Job For Superman,\" the second page contained a panel of the twin Lex Corp buildings in Metropolis, smoldering while a helicopter hovers above.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"5 Times Batman Couldn't Save The Day (&#38; 5 Times Superman Couldn't)\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-superman-failures-comics/\">5 Times Batman Couldn't Save The Day (&#38; 5 Times Superman Couldn't)</a></span></p><p>DC Comics went ahead and sent the issue to retailers on November 2001.

This issue followed <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/rachel-summers/\">Rachel Summers </a> (a refugee from the future) and Amara (a time-displaced citizen from ancient Rome) while sightseeing in Manhattan. When touring the Statue of Liberty, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/rachel-summers-costumes-love-never-want-see-again/\">Rachel recalls how in her timeline</a>, the Twin Towers were attacked and destroyed, leaving thousands dead and injured.</p><p>Following the terror attack on the World Trade Center, fans suggested that this issue was an example of Claremont's apparent foresight, since he envisioned the attack years before it happened. This despite the fact that Claremont only mentions the destruction of the Twin Towers as a passing side-note, as it does not play into the overall story.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>The Attack On The World Trade Center (Marvel)</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sabotage-X.jpg' /></figure><p>The \"Sabotage X<em>\"</em> event teamed <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-man/\">Spider-Man</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-force/\">X-Force</a> against the Unstoppable Juggernaut.

Coincidentally, this crossover depicts the destruction of the World Trade Center once again.</p><p>As the mutants and Spider-Man battled through the streets of New York, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/juggernaut/\">Juggernaut</a> destroys the Twin Towers in an eerily prophetic manner. This attack has seemingly faded into comic book limbo, as the destruction the World Trade Center was never mentioned again in the Marvel Universe.

This just happened to coincide with John Byrne's post-<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/\"><em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em></a> issue one of his <em>Man of Steel</em> limited series, which reintroduced the slightly updated post-<em>Crisis</em> Superman to the DC Universe.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Superman: Every Love Interest The Man Of Steel Has Had In The Comics\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-love-interests-girlfriends-ranked-lois-lane/\">Superman: Every Love Interest The Man Of Steel Has Had In The Comics</a></span></p><p>Following the Challenger tragedy, Byrne redrew one of the pivotal scenes where Superman saved a space shuttle with reporter <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/lois-lane/\">Lois Lane</a> onboard.

In issue #126 -- Byrne's first issue in the run -- Princess Diana of Themyscira is struck down by the demon Neron. Wonder Woman dies in issue #127, and she would be brought back to life shortly after.</p><p>However, the timing of the story was eerie because of what would happen shortly after.

In 1977, parts of the Bronx and Bushwick experienced the first extended power outage since 1965. This was caused by stress on the power grid, following a series of lightning storms in Westchester County. This was then exacerbated by what the New York Times deemed \"human and mechanical error.\"</p><p>The same week as the great New York City Blackout, <em>Marvel Team-Up #60</em>, was released. Here, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/weirdest-spider-man-team-ups-marvel-comics/\">Spider-Man and the Wasp</a> tangle with the villain Equinox.

Another DC film that was inspired by <em>Taxi Driver</em> was the 2019 smash hit <em>Joker</em>. In the film, director Todd Philips decided to not portray the Waynes as the patron saints of Gotham as they had been in previous iterations. And based on Matt Reeves' comments about his film, it seems like <em>The Batman</em> may follow suit in its portrayal of the iconic family.</p><p>Reeves mentioned that the film will explore the corruption that runs rampant through Gotham City and the influence that years of deception have had on the city. He went on to explore the issue by explaining that Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne will be grappling with his family's involvement in the corruption of Gotham. Therefore, not only will he be contemplating his family's legacy in Gotham, but also his own.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-batman-images-leak-reeves-warner-react/\">The Batman Images Leak, Matt Reeves, Warner Bros. React</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/joker-thomas-wayne.jpg\"/></figure><p>In <em>Joker,</em> Thomas Wayne is depicted as a scumbag who parades around Gotham City in his fancy cars and suits, treating people without his privilege and advantages with disrespect. Obviously, this was a starkly different characterization than the caring version seen in <em>Batman Begins</em>. In that film, Bruce's father was depicted as a family man, a doctor and a champion of public service programs in Gotham, aligning him closer to his comic book counterpart.</p><p>However, in the current climate of questioning the social structure and the ever-growing wealth discrepancy in the world, audiences are perhaps tired of the saintly depictions of billionaires. People on the internet will criticize Bruce Wayne in the abstract for spending his money on his Batman persona and equipment, and not enough on things like social programs. While those criticisms are not true of all iterations of the Dark Knight, the increasing amount of these types of jokes are indicative of fans' wish to prod at the billionaire aspect of the Batman character.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/suicide-squad-idrid-elba-character-revealed-john-byrne-superman-run/\">The Suicide Squad: Idris Elba's Character Revealed (Hint: He Shot Superman With A Kryptonite Bullet)</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/batman-trailer-batman2.jpg\"/></figure><p>By leaning into these criticisms and forcing modern Bruce Wayne to confront that legacy, a new aspect of the character can be explored. <em>The Batman</em> may be doing more than following the lead of <em>Joker</em>, as it could also be pushing the concept of a broken Gotham and corrupted legacies to the primary hero. The perspective of the Wayne family in <em>Joker</em> is not to be trusted thanks to the unreliability of Arthur as the narrator. That version of Thomas Wayne is how Arthur perceives him, and potentially could be a complete falsehood.</p><p>However, in <em>The Batman</em>, the reliability of the narrator, at least within the footage and information currently available, can be taken at their word. Therefore, Reeves' film will address the potential corrupt history of the Wayne family head-on. By having the source of the questioning in regards to the morality and honor of the Wayne name actually be a Wayne, it forces a sense of responsibility upon those with privilege and advantage to self-reflect on the role they play in the suffering of the world.</p><p><em>The Batman is directed by Matt Reeves and co-written by Reeves and Mattson Tomlin. The film stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin, Paul Dano as Edward Nashton/The Riddler, John Turturro as Carmine Falcone and Peter Sarsgaard as District Attorney Gil Colson.

He left a scar across the Konoha symbol, which indicated he no longer followed the village's ways and was now a rogue ninja, committing crimes to tarnish Konoha's reputation.

Konoha used the Uchiha Clan and then the Third Hokage had Itachi kill them off, including Sasuke's parents, which is why he wanted to murder his brother in revenge. Weighing all this, he turned his back on Konoha and that headband would become the stuff of legend, as Naruto also realized Konoha made mistakes in the past and turned ninjas into weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>This isn't the first time <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/boruto-anime-framed-narutos-son-for-murder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boruto</a> has been gifted it.

The alien wants Kawaki in exchange, which is why Naruto heads out to fight him. But Sasuke makes it clear they'll need Boruto's help, even if it means he has to tap into Momoshiki's power with the Karma mark. Boruto's scared Momoshiki might take full control of his body.

It's possible that she won't get everything she needs from Barry and the group, as they are all too far ahead of her in terms of their experiences.</p><p>Allegra may learn more from people of a similar age to her. The Titans would take the sister of Ultraviolet in and perhaps demonstrate how she can use her abilities for good, without hurting anyone.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Speedy</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Thea-Queen.jpg' /></figure><p>Thea Queen didn't actually come from the comics but is instead an original creation of the Arrowverse. This iteration of Speedy seems to have her life together, now that she is creating a new League of Heroes.</p><p>However, what would happen if Thea was moved into an alternate reality. She'd still be looking to build the future of vigilantes and would perhaps find a suitable place amongst the Titans as a mentor and a lethal combatant on the battlefield.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Dreamer</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dreamer.jpg' /></figure><p>Dreamer <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-characters-define-next-era-comics/\">could continue to define the next era of comics</a> as she gains more of a spotlight in her own right. Initially joining team Supergirl, she is overshadowed often by the larger theatrics and characters like Brainiac and Martian Manhunter.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/teen-titans-never-died/\">10 Teen Titans That Have Never Died</a></span></p><p>Dreamer could be a significant member of a different team if she was used properly. Therefore, she may find herself in a much better position with the Titans. They need someone of Dreamer's abilities to predict their next threats and she'd perhaps be an interesting character to crossover with Rachel's powers.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Jesse Quick</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Flash-Jesse-Quick.jpg' /></figure><p>Another Speedster now, the original Jesse Quick was becoming the Flash of her own Earth before it was destroyed in <em>Crisis</em>. There's no telling where she could have ended up, but there's a good chance it's on Earth-9, home of the Titans.</p><p>A new version of Jesse would certainly still be finding her feet, especially in a completely different reality. Once again, someone with the powers of the speed force is an invaluable addition to the team and her hopeful attitude could rub off well on some of the more cynical members of the group.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>The Canaries</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zoe-Ramirez.jpg' /></figure><p>The Canaries were formed in the future of the Arrowverse, with <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/arrowverse-black-canary-differences-dc-comics/\">Black Siren and Black Canary</a> leading the group. Members like Zoe Ramirez are still around in the Arrowverse after <em>Crisis </em>and could be an interesting addition to the Titans.</p><p>There's currently no version of the Canaries on Earth-9. While Black Canary herself may exist, Zoe should be able to move to the Titans universe, pick up some more skills, and perhaps even take up the mantle of Black Star or some other significant title.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Reign</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Reign.jpg' /></figure><p>Reign was actually one of Supergirl's villains for a period of time, acting as one of the world destroyers. However, Sam eventually snapped out of her evil trance and can in many ways now be considered to be a sidekick.</p><p>However, the character has not been seen since, which begs the question where has Reign actually gone? Perhaps she could move to the Titans and learn how to hone her abilities as a hero and as someone who is in control, as opposed to being manipulated by ancient Kryptonian forces.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Lita</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lita-Arrowverse.jpg' /></figure><p>Lita is the daughter of Mick Rory and is potentially <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-captain-cold-heatwave-comparison/\">a future variation of Heatwave</a>. She possesses many of her father's qualities and has started to team up with the Legends on a number of occasions.</p><p>The young warrior needs better role models than a former Flash villain though and could be a far better fit for the teens over at Titans tower. She's resourceful and intelligent and may just have a few heat guns to bring along with her.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/arrowverse-dc-realities-titans-should-explore/\">Titans: 10 DC Realities That We'd Love To See The Titans Explore</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:30:02 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Titans-10-Arrowverse-Sidekicks-That-Would-Fit-Perfectly-Into-The-Team-featured-image.jpg","linkMd5":"8b4c870c64e620450375196d6ce14efa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn39@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-10-333_7abc0358254cb747.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":111942,"destBytes":111942,"author":"George Chrysostomou","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Titans-10-Arrowverse-Sidekicks-That-Would-Fit-Perfectly-Into-The-Team-featured-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn39@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-10-333_7abc0358254cb747.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Aresenal.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-22-177_a102609c10acf261.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kid-Flash.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-27-709_bf09b738876ff919.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Luke-Fox.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-30-147_32a7c7f576bf6879.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Allegra-Garcia-arrowverse.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-27-292_dadf4fa099ff6396.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Thea-Queen.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn43@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-24-520_27660e5c11cec7e6.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dreamer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-29-221_4bd23f3a165e6a1e.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Flash-Jesse-Quick.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn48@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-31-152_292ecadfd8d9028b.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zoe-Ramirez.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn94@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-30-002_216347b43d788513.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Reign.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-28-057_bd9a869111d588fb.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lita-Arrowverse.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-26-102_46ac7d59e9475684.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389175},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Marvel's Avengers Takes Up a MASSIVE Amount of the PlayStation 4's Storage Space","link":"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-storage-space-ps4/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Marvels-Avengers-Header.jpg\"/></figure><p>When <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvels-avengers/\">Marvel's Avengers</a></em> debuts next week, it will require players to free up quite a bit of storage space.</p><p>YouTuber TheRelaxingEnd posted an unboxing video of the \"Earth's Mightiest\" edition of the game for Playstation 4 and noted that the game will take 90 MB of memory space.

He has a villain role coming up in the next <em>Fast and Furious</em> film, and in <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, he plays a villain forced to be a hero, pure irony based on his past. In the film, he plays a soldier who worked in the comics for Amanda Waller's Shadow Fighters, and one has to wonder if this is the new movie's version of Rick Flagg.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/suicide-squad-idrid-elba-character-revealed-john-byrne-superman-run/\">The Suicide Squad: Idris Elba's Character Revealed (Hint: He Shot Superman with a Kryptonite Bullet)</a></span></p><p>It is also ironic that John Cena will take on the role of The Peacemaker, who is a \"douchey Captain America.\" Two years ago, he teased fans on Instagram that he might be taking on the role of John Walker, causing a lot of dream casting for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpwJr2sF-eo/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>To understand Cena on social media, he seldom posts anything that has his own words and thoughts written out. Instead, he posts photos and images, allowing fans to determine what he means. He also never lets anyone know if they are right or wrong, allowing his pictures to speak for themselves. The image above is of the shield used by John Walker, the man who at one time was Captain America and then became U.S. Agent when Steve Rogers returned.</p><p>What Walker was, at the end of the day, was a \"douchey Captain America,\" and someone who fought for the little people but had no use for saving the world. He openly spoke his mind, had no problem disregarding other heroes and was someone who had no problem killing anyone and everyone to achieve his goals of protecting people. Seeing Cena take on the role of The Peacemaker, which was an exaggerated version of U.S. Agent already, makes all the sense in the world.</p><p><em>Written and directed by James Gunn, The Suicide Squad stars Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg, Michael Rooker as Savant, Flula Borg as Javelin, David Dastmalchian, as Polka-Dot Man, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, Mayling NG as Mongal, Peter Capaldi as The Thinker, Alice Braga as Solsoria, Steve Agee as King Shark, Pete Davidson as Blackguard, Nathan Fillion as TDK, Sean Gunn as Weasel, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, John Cena as Peacemaker, Taika Waititi and Storm Reid.

Army</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AI-Army-1.jpg' /></figure><p>In the world of Earth-616, Tony Stark became convinced that he was an A.I. version of the real and human Tony Stark. He became Mark One, and established the force that looked to put the status of artificial beings on a par with the human race.</p><p>In the MCU, Tony's gone but maybe he created this crew in secret – which includes his sidekick Machine Man, the Awesome Android, Quasimodo, M-11, and an assortment of Nick Fury LMDs (Life Model Decoys) – who could finally make their onscreen debut.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>The Anachronauts</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kang.jpg' /></figure><p>The Anachronauts deserve a spot in the MCU for their name alone. Formed by Kang and appearing in multiple Fantastic Four comics starting in 1992, Kang and his allies battle all the other warriors they meets in their journeys through time and alternate realities. When Kang defeats them, he gets them to swear allegiance to him – and they become one of the Anachronauts.</p><p>Rumors have been swirling for months over a possible appearance by Kang in an upcoming MCU flick or maybe even have him as the next Thanos, meaning that the Anachronauts could follow close behind.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>The Illuminati</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gjco7mfb4mc11-cropped-1.jpg' /></figure><p>The Illuminati would be a cool and very handy way of drawing different story lines together in future MCU ensemble movies. The Illuminati agree to meet behind the scenes to pool information and work together to combat threats to Earth. In the comics, that major threat was the Kree-Skrull War. Controversially, the Illuminati (minus Namor) thought throwing Hulk into space was a good idea, and this decision blew up in their faces during the events of <em>World War Hulk.</em></p><p>Doctor Strange and T'Challa are already in the MCU, making it likely that they'd form a version of the group at some point. Other members include Namor, Reed Richards, and Professor Charles Xavier; all three who have long been rumored to join the MCU in the future. The most problematic members are Tony Stark and Black Bolt, since Tony died in <em>Avengers: Endgame </em>and the King of the Inhumans' MCU debut in <em>Inhumans </em>failed to meet expectations.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>The Defenders Of The Deep</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Namor.jpg' /></figure><p>The latest rumors about Namor the Submariner include a possible hint or Easter Egg in the upcoming <em>The Eternals</em>, which will hit screens in February 2021. Once he’s actually made his way into the MCU, the Defenders of the Deep -- his super group who protect the world’s oceans -- can’t be far behind.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/xmen-marvel-cinematic-universe-improvements/\">10 Ways The X-Men Will Make The MCU Better</a></span></p><p>The group includes Tiger Shark, King Crab, Andromeda the Atlantean Warrior, Echidna (a character based on Greek mythology), and other denizens of the deep. They set themselves up to defend the oceans against the abusive air-breathers.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>The Offenders</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Offenders.jpg' /></figure><p>This squad of super-villains would shake up the universe of Phase 4 and beyond, with members like Red Hulk and the classic version of Tiger Shark in it. Unfortunately, it may be a while before this villainous team becomes a reality as plans for a <em>The Offenders</em> animated special on Hulu was scuttled, along with a solo <em>Howard the Duck</em> and <em>Tigra &#38; Dazzler</em> TV series.</p><p>The almost-but-didn’t-happen <em>The Offenders </em>would have included Howard, Tigra, Dazzler, Hit-Monkey and M.O.D.O.K. (Mental Mobile Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing) as its main cast. Reportedly, Hit-Monkey and M.O.D.O.K. are still moving forward with their own shows, so maybe we’ll see at least some of the Offenders come together at some point. A full-blown live-action incarnation isn't off the cards either, but it may be a long wait.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>The Power Elite</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Power-Elite-feature.jpg' /></figure><p>The Power Elite is a highly influential and politically powerful group that formed after Hydra's brief takeover of the United States with the help of a Hydra-influenced Captain America. With Hydra gone, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/power-elite-secret-illuminati/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Power Elite</a> and its message of strengthening and purifying America becomes popular with the public. With public distrust of Captain America and democracy at an all time high, the Power Elite easily secures power.</p><p>During this time, Wilson Fisk becomes mayor of New York City, ex-Hydra commander Baron Strucker runs a prison, and Norman Osborn runs Ravencroft Institute. To top it all off, a Red Skull-controlled Aleksander Lukin commands the Power Elite and a resurrected Phil Coulson is working with them. The members of this group have already been assembling in the background of the comics – the MCU could reveal them through an Easter Egg or have one of its major members make a cameo.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>The Unified Thieves &#38; Assassins Guild of New Orleans</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gambit-Feature-Image.jpg' /></figure><p>Gambit's solo movie may have been cancelled (and this may be stretching the definition of “hero”) but Remy LeBeau, one-time member of the Assassins Guild, often likes to play both sides of the table. Bringing in the Guild would gift the MCU with a unique New Orleans setting plus members like Gambit's ex-wife Bella Donna, the zombie-creating mutant Threnody and others who would provide undeniable color and spice.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/xmen-gambit-best-worst-mutant/\">X-Men: 5 Times Gambit Was The Best Mutant (&#38; 5 He Was The Worst)</a></span></p><p>The Unified Guild didn’t last for very long in the comics, but the conflicts between the Thieves and Assassins would add even more entertainment value to the broadening world of the MCU. Also, someone needs to give Gambit a cinematic break.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>The Thunderbolts</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Thunderbolts-10-Worst-Things-Baron-Zemo-Ever-Did.jpg' /></figure><p>In print, it was Baron Zemo who formed The Thunderbolts as part of a nefarious scheme for power. The plan was for the Thunderbolts -- made up of villains donning heroic gimmicks -- to gain public trust by looking like a great replacement for the Avengers, only to then use this newfound goodwill to advance Zemo's plots. Unfortunately for the Baron, members Songbird, Atlas, Moonstone, and others turned against him, and they went on to become forces for good.</p><p>As time went on, the group came to be led by many different characters, including Hawkeye, Luke Cage, and even Norman Osborn. As reformed villains who are now technically anti-heroes, the Thunderbolts know how to beat the enemy because they were once the enemy. They would be an interesting way of recycling old villains who were misused in the MCU.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>The Annihilators</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Annihilators.jpg' /></figure><p>Made up of non-Earth based creatures, the Annihilators helped to prevent and/or contain intergalactic warfare. They’ve appeared alongside Groot and Rocket Raccoon, so this group may be a way for those two offbeat heroes to continue their story after their team's presumed finale that is <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. </em></p><p>At various times, the Annihilators included the Silver Surfer, Ikon/Spaceknight, Ronan the Accuser, and Beta Ray Bill – someone fans have been waiting to appear since he was teased in the background of <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>. Now that the MCU includes outer space, it needs its own Space Force.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Heroes For Hire</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heroes-for-Hire.jpg' /></figure><p>To be fair, we already got a tantalizing glimpse of what the Heroes for Hire might look like, as seen towards the end of Netflix’s<em> Luke Cage</em> series. In the comics, the group forms when Iron Fist joins up with Luke Cage, and they become Power Man and Iron Fist, respectively.</p><p>Heroes for Hire, Inc. -- a group of mercenary heroes who save the day for the right price -- was first formed by lawyer Jeryn Hogarth, and the stories often include Misty Knight, who we miss from the Netflix shows. Others who made their way in and around the group include Black Knight, White Tiger, She-Hulk, Ant-Man and even Deadpool.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/netflix-marvel-cinematic-universe-best-seasons-imdb/\">The 10 Best Netflix MCU Seasons, Ranked By IMDb Score</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:30:53 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AI-Army-MCU.jpg","linkMd5":"570585e6770c5145ea846ac5c587ad08","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-10-475_aa80ef60b998e0ad.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":339464,"destBytes":339464,"author":"Anya Wassenberg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AI-Army-MCU.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-10-475_aa80ef60b998e0ad.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AI-Army-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn99@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-31-692_4c49dd95eb15fd5f.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kang.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn39@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-26-981_3b6f2e1dc2015241.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gjco7mfb4mc11-cropped-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn19@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-24-402_27bfe6ae66ec5771.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Namor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-27-539_bd8d41ca2273485b.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Offenders.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-22-305_287e72eb466a0404.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Power-Elite-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-30-616_512cabaf1c05f0fc.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gambit-Feature-Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-24-381_cb8077e770bda345.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Thunderbolts-10-Worst-Things-Baron-Zemo-Ever-Did.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-26-906_ff7582c772f13a7f.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Annihilators.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-23-286_c1c5b361a9696548.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heroes-for-Hire.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-29-801_4d604933b4b5f034.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389173},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Star Wars: The Original Version of Lando Calrissian Was EXTREMELY Different","link":"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-original-version-lando-calrissian/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lando.jpg\"/></figure><p>Every <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/\"><em>Star Wars</em></a> fan knows Han Solo's suave frenemy, Landonis Balthazar Calrissian, better known simply as Lando Calrissian. He has lived many lives -- he was a gambler, smuggler, card player, the Baron Administrator of Cloud City, and eventually a general in the Rebel Alliance. Lando is easily an icon in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. However, earlier drafts of Lando would have produced a much different version of the character.</p><p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-empire-strikes-back/\">The Empire Strikes Back</a>,</em> George Lucas wanted to introduce a character from Han Solo's past to reveal more of the background of the sarcastic smuggler. He settled on a character named Lando Kadar. In one of the first story conferences for his sequel film, Lucas brought in his ideas for who Lando Kadar might be -- a trader on a Wookie planet, a James Bond-type character, or a clone from the Clone Wars.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-darth-vader-qui-gon-obi-wan/\">Star Wars: Darth Vader Proves Why He Was Always BETTER Than Qui-Gon &#38; Obi-Wan</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/star-wars-han-lando.jpg\"/></figure><p>Lucas soon realized that his first idea -- Lando as a trader from a Wookie planet -- wasn't exactly what he was going for. He realized he wanted Lando to be somewhat of a contrast to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-times-han-solo-was-right-mistaken/\">Han Solo</a>. Han is more of an unpolished, crude, rough-and-tumble character, and Lucas wanted Lando to be more refined, slick, and charming. Here is where Lucas began to lean more towards the James Bond-esque version of Lando Kadar: perfect, suave, cunning, and oozing with swagger. Out of Lucas' three ideas, this seems to be the one that eventually stuck.</p><p>Lucas could have stopped there, but he instead took a hard turn. He decided Lando Kadar should be a clone who survived from the Clone Wars, and toyed with the idea of Lando <em>looking</em> human, but not quite <em>being</em> human. Lucas had a whole \"Lando the Clone\" backstory planned out. <a href=\"http://www.forcematerial.com/home/2016/10/24/the-calrissian-clone-connection\">Early scripts reveal</a> that clone Lando's great-grandfather wanted many sons, so he produced them using cells from his own body. His great-grandfather's sister did the same thing, producing daughters in the same manner. The film takes place many years after the Clone Wars and Lando says that there are not many of his kind left, so they try not to attract attention. He also states that he feels truly alone now that he has been exposed to the world and sees that not everyone is a clone.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-theory-rey-luke-skywalker-aunt/\">Star Wars Theory: Rey Is Actually Luke Skywalker's... Aunt?!</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/spinoff/2016/08/lando-social.jpg\"/></figure><p>The idea of replacing Lando Calrissian with clone Lando Kadar is very interesting, and would have taken the series in quite a different direction. It would have introduced the history of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-who-funded-clone-army-creation/\">Clone Wars</a> to the audience much earlier than the series eventually did, and the concept of clones would have been starkly different than what was eventually produced in the prequels. It's likely that Lucas wasn't ready to delve into the Clone Wars quite yet. It's also likely that he believed Lando would be more of a compelling character without the complicated clone backstory.</p><p>Eventually, Lucas eliminated the idea of Lando being a clone. Now, the <em>Star Wars</em> universe has its charming Lando Calrissian, Baron Administrator of Cloud City, complete with his fantastic cape and charm -- and devoid of any clone status.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-rey-finn-poe-lego-disney/\">Star Wars: Rey, Finn and Poe Get the LEGO Treatment in Disney+ Holiday Special </a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:45:17 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lando.jpg","linkMd5":"0826afdba103322dd2e6f04d33c55b2f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-12-102_555df6a26550b55d.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":89006,"destBytes":89006,"author":"Annaliese Yip","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lando.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-12-102_555df6a26550b55d.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/star-wars-han-lando.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn35@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-26-131_77331f9d9b0c4594.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/spinoff/2016/08/lando-social.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-22-806_487b86d0f3985334.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389184},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"First Snow Has a TOUGH Hidden Steam Achievement - Here's How to Unlock It","link":"https://www.cbr.com/steam-first-snow-hidden-achievement/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/First-Snow.png\"/></figure><p>On Tuesday, Salty Salty Studios released a new, free-to-play visual novel called <em>First Snow</em>.

There, they can download the game's 18+ patch and follow the instructions to add the content to the Steam download.

However, due to the time gap between the series, there are a lot of fights that we just never got to see. In this new exclusive video, though, we're going to break down some of those potential fights and explain just what would happen.</p><p>We're starting off with Avatar Aang versus Avatar Korra. This is going to be a bit of a complicated fight to explain, as they have similar powers and are incredibly awesome. Aang starts out the series as a master Airbender, learning various other bending styles along the way. The drawback for Aang, though, is that he's young and doesn't get a ton of time to master every ability. Korra, on the other hand, excels at most styles of bending from a young age, even if she never becomes as proficient at Airbending as Aang. Korra, though, can Metalbend, which is a formidable skill. In the end, Korra would probably win, as she's both better trained and a much more fighting-oriented character.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-kyoshi-rangi-vs-korrasami-best-otp/\">Avatar: Kyoshi/Rangi Vs.

With Stray's release date still some time away, many eager gamers are looking for something to curb their appetite for adventurous animal games. A lesser-known PlayStation 2 title, <em>Dog's Life,</em> might be the perfect game to tide video game fans over.</p><p><em>Dog's Life</em> is an unconventional game full of adventure, mystery and humor. It follows a jovial dog named Jake as he ventures out to save his crush Daisy, who has been picked up by the local dog catchers. Jake must explore different the open world to find clues of Daisy's whereabouts. Upon his search, Jake uncovers a conniving plot that puts all the local dogs in jeopardy.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/high-score-jerry-lawson-channel-f-cartridge-console/\">How Jerry Lawson's Forgotten Channel F Console Changed Video Games Forever</a></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dogs-life-2.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>Dog's Life</em> takes place across three different towns, starting in Jake's rural hometown of Clarksville. Eventually, players move to a ski resort called Lake Miniwahwah and an urban metropolis known as Boom City. Every location is vastly different, though not incredibly detailed. The everchanging scenery keeps things fresh and prevents the game from growing stale, providing plenty of things to do to keep players occupied.</p><p>Most of <em>Dog's Life</em> gameplay is exploring the open world to collect different smells, which unlock a variety of minigames. The game's most unique attribute is its Smellovision feature, which players will need to activate to find different scents scattered across each town. The smells are color coated and unlock different things depending on their color and location. One scent might unlock a race, while another unlocks a tug-o-war minigame. If players complete a minigame successfully, they'll receive a bone that will increase Jakes's stats. Bones are key collectibles in <em>Dog's Life</em> and are vital to the game's progression.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/apple-epic-games-fortnite-lawsuit-no-exception/\">Apple Responds to Epic Games' Fortnite/App Store Lawsuit: 'We Won't Make an Exception'</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dogs-life-gameplay.jpg\"/></figure><p>Although <em>Dog's Life</em> can be enjoyed at any age, its obvious the developer created the game with younger audiences in mind. <em>Dog's Life</em> is very light-hearted and full of childish humor, including its fair share of fart jokes and other immature gags. <em>Dog's Life</em> is much more mellow than most modern games as well, offering a laid back and relaxing experience as players traverse the mellow landscape searching for scents and collectibles. <em>Dog's Life</em> is one of those games to wind down to after a long day at work. Its gentle and effervescent nature makes it one of the more tranquil games to come out of the sixth console generation.</p><p><em>Dog's Life</em> is a very original game that is often overlooked by many gamers. While it's not the most polished game in the world, it offers a fresh gaming experience that gamers of all ages can enjoy. It is an extremely relaxing game where players can have simplistic fun and get away from all the troubles in the world. <em>Dog's Life</em> is the perfect game to tide fans over until Stray's highly anticipated release.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-go-unova-week-bonus-content/\">Pokémon GO: Everything Happening In Unova Week</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:15:17 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dogs-life.jpg","linkMd5":"69f47723702cd9b90a0aefb5d47262eb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-09-332_5169fcdab40fb8ab.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":70442,"destBytes":70442,"author":"Zack Millsap","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dogs-life.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-09-332_5169fcdab40fb8ab.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dogs-life-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-21-157_101ed6ad598c5335.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dogs-life-gameplay.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-31-697_500b750e4ffe720d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389171},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Batman: Clownhunter Is Basically Gotham City’s Punisher | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/batman-clownhunter-gotham-city-punisher/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Punisher-Clownhunter.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following article contains spoilers for</strong> </em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman/\"><strong>Batman</strong></a><em><strong> #97, by James Tynion IV, Jorge Jimenez, Tomeu Morey and Clayton Cowles, available now.</strong></em></p><p>The new character known only as Clownhunter debuted in <em>Batman</em> #96. He is a young Gotham citizen who has had just about enough of the Joker attacking the people of his city. Now that the Clown Prince of Crime's followers are running rampant throughout the city streets, the young man whose real identity remains a secret, for now, has cobbled up together his own costume to go on the hunt for clowns.</p><p>At the start of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker-war/\">Joker War</a>, this new vigilante went out on his first patrol. We saw him <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-clownhunter-debut/\">claim the life of his first clown-mask wearing thug</a>. thus Clownhunter lived up to his name. Now, he's getting busier and busier.

She instructs them to take the shipment to Ace Chemical, but one of the clowns tells her this is a bad idea considering it's open season on the clowns down in the Narrows -- where Ace Chemicals is located.</p><p>When Punchline asks why the clowns are so scared to go there, she is informed that twelve of them were killed yesterday alone — and, they were all taken out by the same person: Clownhunter.</p><p>Indeed, the young vigilante has stepped up his game already. In the Narrows, we see that he's no longer just using his Batarang-adorned baseball bat to kill his victims. No, he proves to be a resourceful (and brutal) hunter when he uses a fire hydrant and a transformer to short circuit one of the Batmobiles the clowns are driving around in. With no power, the clowns are trapped in the vehicle. Clownhunter uses gasoline and a match to burn his victims alive.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-96-joker-war-harley-quinn-return/\">Joker War: [SPOILER] Is Back - and Ready to Help Batman</a></span></p><p>Later, Clownhunter attacks one of the trucks transporting Punchline's chemicals. He takes the shipment out with a calculated explosion that takes out even more of the clowns, leaving only one of them burned half to death to tell Punchline what happened.</p><p>Clownhunter may have been active for a relatively short period of time, but he's already racked up an impressive body count. He's got a brutal reputation, and the clowns are scared of him. What's more, it looks like he's just getting started, which means things could get a whole lot worse — and much bloodier — for the clowns.</p><p>When the Joker gets wind of Clownhunter later in the issue, he's actually happy. Sure, he's angry that his men are getting killed, but he thinks it's delightful that something is changing in Gotham City. All the members of the Bat-Family follow the Dark Knight's no-kill policy; it's what sets them apart from other vigilantes. But Clownhunter doesn't share this rule. He's declared war on the clowns, and he's hunting them down without mercy.</p><p>Essentially, he's become Gotham's very own Punisher. And right now, that may just be what the city needs.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-joker-war-blackest-night/\">Batman: Joker War Is Building Gotham's Blackest Night</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 04:30:03 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Punisher-Clownhunter.jpg","linkMd5":"3d8bd9e46431a1219331410dd6ddcbfd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-09-394_f2d0ea1e1bc285d7.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":206125,"destBytes":173834,"author":"Ian Cardona","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Punisher-Clownhunter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-09-394_f2d0ea1e1bc285d7.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Clownhunter-Joker-War.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-32-232_d87c3c3cd1a175cc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389185},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"The Hulk Survived the End of the World Thanks to Marvel's WEIRDEST Villain","link":"https://www.cbr.com/maestro-future-hulk-villain-modok/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Maestro-1.jpg\"/></figure><p><strong><em>WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/maestro/\">Maestro</a> #1, by Peter David, German Peralta, Jesus Aburtov, Dale Keown, Jason Keith and VC's Ariana Maher, on sale now.</em></strong></p><p>Marvel is in the midst of offering a new origin story for one of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/hulk/\">Hulk</a>'s greatest villains, the future alternate version of the Hulk known as Maestro.

However, even M.O.D.O.K.'s circuitry is beginning to fail, and he had forgotten Hulk was down there.</p><p>Now, Hulk is free, and he realizes that the ideals of heroes were always wrong. Superheroes were so preoccupied with villains and world-ending plots that they were completely blindsided by the most likely outcome: humanity destroying itself through war and strife. M.O.D.O.K. knew that a unique mind was needed to bring the world back from devastation, and those minds belonged to people like the Hulk. However, the Hulk has no interest in rebuilding the world that was, and he's already started down the isolationist path towards becoming the Maestro.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Hulk: How the Avenger REALLY Became Immortal\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hulk-how-avengers-became-immortal/\">Hulk: How The Avenger REALLY Became Immortal</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 17:20:08 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Maestro-1.jpg","linkMd5":"9f658ea74277f672384cb92b038f43b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn83@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-11-580_5a5407de1d7fb42f.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":132386,"destBytes":132386,"author":"Shawn S.

New players are trying the RPG for the first time, and the game has never been more accessible. This is due in large part to the development of online tools which make running and playing <em>D&#38;D</em> much simpler. Two of the most popular services available are <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> and <em>Roll20</em>.</p><p>Both serve different functions (with some overlap) and can be used in tandem, but a gaming group may only need to use one over the other. Here's a breakdown of both to help determine which best serves your group's needs.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-importance-of-the-pantheon/\">Dungeons &#38; Dragons: The Importance of the Pantheon</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DND-Beyond-Logo.jpg\"/></figure><p>This is Wizards of the Coast's official online service for <em>D&#38;D</em>. It serves as a repository for all of Fifth Edition and primarily functions as a way to easily create and store characters online, as it does all the math for you. It also allows you to search for a specific rule through the compendium rather than flipping through a dozen books. It allows DMs to create campaigns, which players can join with their generated characters, and lets the DM store preplanned encounters for upcoming sessions. Recently, <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> has added a digital dice rolling function, which is a great tool for new players who don’t feel like investing money in physical dice yet.</p><p>Access to material beyond the basic rules, sourcebooks and adventures must be purchased through the site. Books are sold in bundles or à la carte, giving members the flexibility to pick and choose what material they need. <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> also has tools for incorporating and sharing homebrew creations with the community and maintains an active forum.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-5e-how-to-run-a-dark-souls-themed-campaign/\">Dungeons &#38; Dragons 5e: How to Run a Dark Souls-Themed Campaign</a></span></p><p><em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> has three tiers of service plans to suit an individual's needs. To start, there is the Free Tier -- the best option for new players who just want to see what <em>D&#38;D</em> is about. The Free Tier grants members access to the basic rules and the ability to create and join campaigns. Free Tier is limited to six character slots, eight encounter slots and does contain ads.</p><p>Next is the Hero Tier, which is recommended for players who have committed to <em>D&#38;D</em> and are frequent players. Hero Tier costs $25.99 yearly or $2.99 monthly. With it, all ads are removed and players have unlimited character and encounter slots. In addition, Hero Tier grants early access to new tools that get added to the ever-expanding service.</p><p>Finally, there is the Master Tier, which is recommended only for DMs and absolute <em>D&#38;D</em> die-hards. It costs $54.99 yearly or $5.99 monthly. It provides all the same privileges as Hero Tier with one powerful exception -- content sharing. Master Tier subscribers may share any purchased marketplace content for up to five campaigns, with a twelve player cap on each. In plain terms, this means one person with a Master Tier account can share access to all of their purchased materials with up to sixty people. This is a fantastic option and allows even Free Tier members a chance to see the full depth of <em>D&#38;D</em>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-mythic-odysseys-theros-pantheon/\">D&#38;D: Who Are the Gods in the Pantheon of Theros?</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Roll20-Logo.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>Roll20</em> is a different beast. Primarily, it is a Virtual Tabletop (VTT for short), and while it's not the only one out there, but it is the most prominent. A VTT allows for a <em>D&#38;D</em> game to be played completely online. It's main function is to serve as an online game map, replacing the miniatures and grid paper with tokens and rendered maps. But <em>Roll20</em> also provides integrated audio and video chat functions in an attempt to provide as comprehensive an experience as possible.</p><p>Like <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em>, <em>Roll20</em> only grants free access to the basic rules, and any additional sourcebooks or adventures must be purchased separately. The marketplace also sells material not made by Wizards of the Coast. Content creators can upload their own tokens, map tiles, pre-written adventures and more for members to purchase. <em>Roll20</em> also has a \"Looking For Group\" service to help players and DMs find new people to play with.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dd-fan-created-combat-wheelchair-inclusivity/\">D&#38;D: Fan-Created Combat Wheelchair Establishes Baseline Inclusivity</a></span></p><p><em>Roll20</em> is also comprised of three subscription tiers. The Free Tier contains advertisements, 100 MB upload storage, a 2 limit on LFG listings and the ability to share purchased content with one campaign of up to five players. It's the best option for new players but is not recommended for DMs due to its limited access to <em>Roll20</em>'s more advanced features.</p><p>The Plus Tier costs $49.99 yearly or $4.16 monthly. At this level, subscribers are granted 3 GB of storage, no ads, the ability to transfer characters between campaigns and unlimited LFG listings. In addition, the Plus Tier allows compendium sharing across three campaigns of up to ten players. Most importantly, it grants access to <em>Roll20</em>'s powerful dynamic lighting system, which allows DMs to create map boundaries and immersive lighting effects.</p><p><em>Roll20</em>'s Pro Tier is recommended for hardcore DMs and content creators for <em>Roll20</em>'s marketplace. It costs $99.99 yearly or $8.33 monthly. Storage is increased to 6 GB, compendium sharing is enabled for five campaigns of up to fifteen people and Pro members' LFG postings are highlighted. The main bonus for the Pro account is the ability to create custom character sheet templates, gain access to community-supported API tools and features as well as the Dev Server, where <em>Roll20</em>'s new features are available for testing.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dd-incorporate-one-shots-into-campaigns/\">D&#38;D: How to Incorporate One-Shots Into Extended Campaigns</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DnD-Easier-to-Make-Characters.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> and <em>Roll20</em> are both powerful, comprehensive tools, but they are not the same. If your group is looking for an accessible online encyclopedia and repository for their characters then <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> is the right service for you. However, if your group is looking to play completely online, <em>Roll20</em> is the better choice since, unlike <em>Beyond</em>, it is primarily a virtual replacement for maps and miniatures. <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> has a friendlier interface in regards to finding and sorting through the multitude of supplements, but it cannot serve as a replacement tabletop.</p><p>Of course, <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> and <em>Roll20</em> are not mutually exclusive. Many online groups use both, with <em>Roll20</em> doing its main job as a virtual tabletop and <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> serving as a more comprehensive way to lookup rules. In fact, there is a third-party extension called <em>Beyond20</em> that allows the two services to interact. With <em>Beyond20</em>, a player can click on an attack or skill on their <em>Beyond</em> character sheet and have it roll on <em>Roll20</em>'s tabletop. The <em>Beyond20</em> extension is a boon for DMs, as it quickly allows them to add in new monsters without having to set up a new character sheet or tokens. No matter which route a group goes, <em>D&#38;D Beyond</em> and <em>Roll20</em> both offer invaluable services that make <em>D&#38;D</em> easier than ever before.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-my-little-pony-campaign/\">Dungeons &#38; Dragons: How to Create a My Little Pony Campaign</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:15:34 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dnd-beyond-roll-20.jpg","linkMd5":"e2ddeb62b04f7b2712e019cebbab436d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn96@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-11-670_23ddd81dd9e92593.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":144088,"destBytes":144088,"author":"Ari David","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dnd-beyond-roll-20.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn96@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-11-670_23ddd81dd9e92593.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DND-Beyond-Logo.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-26-595_fee5ae9d0b43de3f.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Roll20-Logo.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-27-911_798a7d076a8be09a.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DnD-Easier-to-Make-Characters.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-24-952_667ea1f02fcc36d9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389184},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"DC: 10 Pieces Of Gorilla Grodd Fan Art That Make Us Go Bananas","link":"https://www.cbr.com/gorilla-grodd-best-fan-art-dc-comics/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gorilla-grodd-art.jpg\"/></figure><p>Gorilla Grodd is arguably the Flash's most iconic villain. His <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-worst-apes-in-comics-ranked/\">bizarre and strangely coherent ideology for ape supremacy</a> is a recurring theme in the many stories he is involved in, rendering him  a welcome relic of the past where more outrageous villain concepts were embraced.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-carnage-vs-avengers-win-lose/\">Avengers: 5 Members Carnage Can Defeat (&#38; 5 He'd Lose To)</a></span></p><p>He swings into battle with more than just the physical striking power of a fully developed gorilla. His mind is his greatest tool, utilized to create weapons and hypnotize his opponents into doing his bidding. Thanks to these distinctive qualities, many fans have attributed art to him, honoring the villain in all of his simian glory.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Cyber Monkey</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ENHANCE.jpg' /></figure><p>Gorilla Grodd is more than a supervillain; he is a creature of science, citing his intellectual superiority as reason to transform humanity into apes. <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/phil-cho/art/Gorilla-Grodd-Earth-27-commission-634071091\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phil-cho</a> demonstrates this affinity through their artwork, outfitting DC's most menacing beast with a full set of cybernetic augmentations.</p><p>The most noticeable feature is his eyepiece, a green mechanic iris contrasting his blood-red ordinary pupil. Given how much metal is strewn about his body, it makes one wonder what of the ape is left after these drastic changes. Intriguingly, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-cyborgs-most-powerful-weapons/\">his armor application is reminiscent of Teen Titan's Cyborg</a>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Mad World</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mad-world.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/vinhluanluu/art/Gorilla-Grodd-576506382\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vinhluanluu</a> brilliantly depicts Gorilla Grodd's insatiable thirst for conquest in this piece. With a blood-red background, he looms over an unsuspecting Central City, doubtlessly fantasizing about its destruction and how he might arrange it.</p><p>It also reflects the fact that Grodd's idealistic world does exist elsewhere, in the form of Gorilla City. As its namesake implies, it is a model for what he wishes to bring upon to the rest of the world — a literal planet of the apes. Should the Justice League fail to thwart him, he would doubtlessly succeed.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Bow Before Grodd</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grodd-3.jpg' /></figure><p>The talented <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/admirawijaya/art/Gorilla-Grodd-84304550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AdmiraWijaya</a> reminds fans that while Grodd's criminal mind is a tremendous asset, it is perfectly complemented by his physical brawn. In this image, he seizes the Flash by the throat, dangling him over the edge of a building and roaring triumphantly.</p><p>It is reminiscent of King Kong, a less intelligent primate that Grodd would likely attempt to distance himself from. Nonetheless, as much as he may posture otherwise, the villain cannot suppress his bestial nature forever, especially in the heat of battle. His ferocity is as much of a blessing as it is a curse.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Smug Simian Smile</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Justinwasson cleverly contrasts a black-and-white color scheme with the vibrant golden helmet his Grodd is currently experimenting with. The device is no ordinary trinket; through it, he is able to hone his mind-control abilities, dominating the willpower of the Flash.</p><p>Grodd's mind control was even nearly enough to overcome Lex Luthor's vast intellect. If Superman's arch-nemesis hadn't come prepared with his own countermeasures, the Legion of Doom would be in the Gorilla's broad and capable hands. Such an outcome would redefine the series and give fans a finale significantly different than Darkseid's return.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Grim Gorilla Grit</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/determination.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/5wdub2/gorilla_grodd_fanart_that_i_made/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TheKubist</a> presents a Grodd that is often unseen: one deep in contemplative thought. It is another side of the character that is often underappreciated since whatever screentime he has is usually attributed to his machinations.</p><p>Abandoning many traditional comic conventions, Kubist portrays an authentic Grodd, one that could plausibly run rampant in our world. The realism conveyed in this artwork makes it more compelling, successfully bringing us to appreciate the character's visceral grace and power. Without the Flash to protect us, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/gorillas-monkeys-apes-in-comics/\">Grodd's existence would evince dire, apelike consequences</a>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Game On</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flash-vs-grodd-1.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dan-the-artguy/art/theFlash-v-Gorilla-Grodd-680931434\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dan-the-artguy</a> wittily synthesizes his pop culture knowledge to complete this piece.

As flashy and dramatic as many heroes' antics might be, they still suffer from human mortality. A few well-connected punches would be all Grodd needs to defeat most of the Justice League.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Mind Over Monkey</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mind-gorilla.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/timlevins/art/Justice-League-vs-Grodd-cover-721347928\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TimLevins</a> portrays a Grodd that has accomplished the impossible; through cunning and intelligence, he has managed to turn most of the Justice League into apes. Firestorm, Hawkman, and Wonder Woman screech and lumber about inconsolably, with only Green Lantern and Vixen shielded from his sinister schemes.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that this Gorilla Grodd stylistically borrows from 2004's <em>Justice League Unlimited.  </em>In this series, Grodd would play a proactive role, asserting himself as the main antagonist in several episodes and jockeying for power within the Legion of Doom.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Run, Barry!</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-barry.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/cartoonartworks/art/The-Flash-vs-Gorilla-Grodd-772147550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CartoonArtworks</a> realizes the Flash's considerable disadvantages when going against his most famous rival. Flash does not have Grodd's intelligence, durability, or strength, instead relying primarily on speed and  creativity to outmaneuver his primate opponent.</p><p>In this image, he narrowly avoids being pounded into the concrete by the vengeful villain. The force of the blow is powerful enough to crack the road, entailing Grodd's unparalleled physical might. Our hero notices how close the blow was to connecting, unsettling him amidst their melee.

Atticus, his uncle George and their friend Letitia Lewis' respective anxieties are made real in the latest episode of <em>Lovecraft Country</em> when the trio is held captive by the sinister Sons of Adam, visibly shaking them to their core.</p><p>After barely surviving a night filled with <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-historical-roots-scariest-scene/\">racist sheriffs and ravenous vampires</a> in the New England woods, Atticus and the others were welcomed into a palatial estate, which is the last known whereabouts of Atticus' missing father, Montrose Freeman. While Atticus remained wary of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-introduces-cult/\">mysterious group</a> running the estate, Letitia and George quickly settled into their new digs, with the former finding a full wardrobe tailored to her size while the latter marveled over bookcases stocked with his favorite texts.

While Christina Braithwaite, daughter of the cult's leader Samuel Braithwaite, agrees to remove the spells inhibiting Letitia and George's memories and cognition, the three are confined to their bedrooms while preparations for the ritual continue. And while one spell has been lifted from the captive guests, they soon discover that they have been subjected to an even more insidious form of dark magic.</p><p>Leti is greeted by a vision of Atticus and confides in him that her entire life she has been plagued with insecurities and abandonment issues stemming from her mother leaving her as a child after the death of her stepfather. In the moment of vulnerability, Leti kisses Atticus, unaware that the image of her friend is just a magically induced hallucination. Over in his bedroom, Atticus has problems of his own, as he's attacked by a young North Korean woman wielding a knife. After the skirmish, Atticus is revealed to be deeply haunted by his actions during the Korean War, with the woman seemingly someone he killed while in the military. George's vision is more peaceful, reunited with his deceased wife Dora. Instead of being unnerved, George realizes the vision isn't real and joins her for one last dance.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-series-premiere-shoggoth-explainer/\">Lovecraft Country: What are the Shoggoth, the Series’ First Monsters?</a></span></p><p>While the characters eventually come to their senses and are released from their respective bedrooms, the hallucinations offer an interesting glimpse into each of the their psyches that will likely inform their decisions as the season progresses. And with the trio under constant observation by the Sons of Adam, the sinister cult now knows what makes each of its captives tick mentally, making the secret organization even more dangerous than before. Each of them has their own heart of darkness, and thanks to the dark magic of the Sons of Adam, Atticus and friends just confronted each of their own demons head-on.</p><p><em>Starring Jonathan Majors, Jurnee Smollett, Aunjanue Ellis, Abbey Lee, Jada Harris, Wunmi Mosaku and Michael K.

As a consequence, he would banish the giant's memories soon after, resetting the relationship between her and her fairy companion once again.</p><p>After reliving the past through Drole's eyes, Diane was able to understand what he had been through. Instead of holding a grudge, she knew that he needed companionship rather than retribution, putting aside the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/seven-deadly-sins-gowther-traitor-vs-hero/\">grievous wrong</a> he had dealt to her and offering to be his friend instead.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Merlin - Magical Items</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/merlin-items-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Merlin offers more than direct offensive and defensive utilities to the Sins ~ she supports them through a plethora of magical items, ones which help her friends blend in during daily life.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/seven-deadly-sins-best-ban-fan-artwork/\">Seven Deadly Sins: 10 Pieces Of Ban Fan Art That Leave Us Greedy For More</a></span></p><p>Examples include Escanor's glasses, which are able to contain his terrifying power even during the day, and Diane's size manipulation.

Only one person was able to help her; her future partner, Zalpa. He was a savage that Diane had spared in a previous fight. Were it not for her mercy, Matrona would have perished.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Merlin - Defeating Grayroad</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/grayroad-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Grayroad's commandment of pacifism made her a nearly impossible opponent to destroy. She had all of the durable of the other nine demons, though anyone who dared to strike her would rapidly age and wither.</p><p>The only person to circumvent this was Merlin, and she was effectively immortal. Because there was no limit to the years she would live, she could not wither by the demon's spell. Additionally, the blessings of the goddess and demon races protected her from it, making her arguably the only person who could have defeated the demon (save Ban).</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Diane - Growth</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/diane-potential-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Diane's growth is one more than physical. Over the duration of the series, she has overcome her enviousness of Meliodas (as she had previously desired to be with him), her insecurity as a \"lesser\" giant, and even the many obstacles which had separated her and King from being together.</p><p>Just as importantly, her power has also seen a dramatic increase, first from receiving her Gideon and next from the lessons of Drole.

Always the type to wear his heart on his sleeve, Mori can't hide a sudden bout of melancholy from his friends, Mira and Daewi, who mistake his mood for a lack of faith in their abilities as a team to make it the end of the national tournament. By the episode's end, Mori's spirits are lifted with a surprise birthday party, which is Mira and Daewi attempt to bring him out of his funk; however, the following morning brings the worst present ever: a ransom note for his missing grandpa.</p><p>Given all that has happened so far leading up to this cliffhanger, we know exactly who the culprits are, and what their game is.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/crunchyroll-launches-the-god-of-high-school-streetwear-collection/\">Crunchyroll Launches Eye-Popping God Of High School Streetwear Collection</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/God-of-High-School-Mira-Daewi-birthday.png\"/></figure><p>Unbeknownst to Mira and Daewi, Mori recently received news from tournament boss, Park Mujin, that Mori's grandpa, Jin Taejin, is likely dead. Mujin's team, while out looking for Taejin, discovered the site of the huge explosion at which he fought the Nox cultists. There was enough of the older man's blood left behind to presume he didn't make it out alive. Naturally, this information is what sends Mori into a depressive tailspin in Episode 8 -- which is only made <em>worse </em>by the fact that it's his birthday. His grandpa seemingly left him to fight the \"bad guys\" when he was just six-years-old, and all Mori has left of him is a photo of the two of them together. Now, just turning 17, Mori stares at the picture and wonders if the possibility of Taejin ever returning as promised is gone forever.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mujin and Nox are declaring all-out war on each other. Nox has already dealt heavy blows to the powerful Mujin: assassinating announcer Sim Bongsa; attempting to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-god-of-high-schools-q-pushes-past-his-limit-in-exclusive-episode-7-clip/\">kill Commissioner Q at his home</a> and imbedding a mole right under Mujin's nose. What Nox doesn't know is that they actually failed to kill Bongsa's family as planned -- thanks to Commissioner's P's Marionette charyeok -- and that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/god-of-high-school-episode-6-mujin-nox-mistake-traitor/\">Mujin is now well-aware of the traitor</a>. At a meeting with his staff, he instructs them to remove their limiters and strike the turncoat at full-force, as well as stop Nox from ruining the God of High School tournament. \"We must obtain the Key that will bring down God at any cost.\"</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-god-of-high-school-epside-6-jugok-unstoppable-monster-nationals/\">The God Of High School: An Unstoppable Monster Tears Through Nationals</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/God-of-High-School-Jin-Taejin.png\"/></figure><p>Nox's mysterious leader, at the same, addresses their acolytes with a similar speech. \"People who have forgotten God’s greatness and corrupted our world are attempting power that rivals that of God himself. Stop them, and do what you must to destroy the Key that threatens God!\" As each of them namedrops the \"Key,\" the anime cuts to Mori, hard at work training, making it obvious that Mori is, at the very least, a potential holder of this title. That also puts a target squarely on his back for Nox.</p><p>The day after Mori's birthday, he receives an anonymous letter with a map and photo of his grandpa's beaten and tied-up body inside. The good part is that Mujin might be wrong about Taejin being likely dead, but it also confirms that Mori is next on Nox's hit list. Luring him away from the tournament to rescue his grandpa kills two birds with one stone: disrupting Mujin's tournament by removing a frontrunner while, at the same time, destroying the thing that the sinister group views as an anti-God weapon. Whether or nor Mori is smart enough to recognize how obvious the trap is is irrelevant -- he's lead by his feelings, and will probably do whatever it takes to recover his only family.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-god-of-high-school-episode-6-dragon-ball-mori-goku/\">The God Of High School Makes Its Dragon Ball Connection Unmistakable</a>     </span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:45:05 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/God-of-High-School-Mujin-Episode-8-header.png","linkMd5":"e79e8c0c8da60513ff69a9e8eec80283","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-11-688_31fd3a2b2cd25d57.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":960,"sourceBytes":828518,"destBytes":828518,"author":"Hannah Collins","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/God-of-High-School-Mujin-Episode-8-header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-11-688_31fd3a2b2cd25d57.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/God-of-High-School-Mira-Daewi-birthday.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn31@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-26-097_39a266103aab32a6.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/God-of-High-School-Jin-Taejin.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-24-607_21e5a398243aa064.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389180},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Justice League: Watchmen's Patrick Wilson Responds to Zack Snyder's Song Choice for HBO Max Trailer","link":"https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-watchmen-patrick-wilson-responds-hallelujah-song-choice-zack-snyder/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aquaman-orm.jpg\"/></figure><p>Actor Patrick Wilson had a clever response to the song used in the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/zack-snyder-justice-league-trailer-darkseid-shocking-death/\">new trailer</a> for Zack Snyder's director's cut of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/justice-league-film/\">Justice League</a>.</p><p>The trailer for <em>Zack Snyder's Justice League</em> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-trailer-music-watchmen-hallelujah/\">uses the song</a> \"Hallelujah\" by Leonard Cohen.

Natsu tends to get on Gray's nerves and vice versa, and if Erza isn't around to restrain them, they'll just butt head and lose sight of the mission.</p><p>Gray knows that, so he'd rather keep Natsu off the team so he can focus on the job (and allow Natsu to focus on his own work). Besides, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fairy-tail-anime-better-fighter-natsu-dragneel-gray-fullbuster/\">fire and ice are an awkward combination</a> at times, and Gray has different ideas on how to complete a mission than Natsu does.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Team Up With: Panther Lily</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Panther-lily-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Panther Lily is an Exceed native to Edolas, and joined Fairy Tail when he made friends with <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fairy-tail-ways-gajeel-redfox-best-character-overrated/\">Gajeel</a> (whom he once fought). Panther Lily doesn't cast spells, but his strength and swordplay are formidable.

In addition, this Exceed's personality and handling of a mission are definitely on the same page as Gray's.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Reject: Minerva Orland</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/minerva-sad.jpg' /></figure><p>Minerva belongs to the Sabertooth guild, and she is quite a powerful wizard in her own right. She can use magic that teleports people and magic spells around, and she can also use advanced martial arts up close. She's powerful from any range.</p><p>However, Gray barely even knows her, and like other Fairy Tail wizards, he relies on the strength of friendship and trust to complete a mission. For a high-stakes mission, he won't assume the risks associated with bringing along a distant associate.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Team Up With: Lucy Heartfilia</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucy-smart.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fairy-tail-lucy-facts-fans-know/\">Lucy Heartfilia</a> joined the Fairy Tail guild and had Natsu and Happy to welcome her, and she has proven her worth since then.

In combat, Evergreen can launch ranged attacks, and her eye magic allows her to turn enemies to stone, like a gorgon of Greek myth.</p><p>These abilities don't necessarily mesh well with Gray's magic, however, and like Bickslow and Freed, Evergreen's sheer power falls well short of Gray's. And, of course, there's the factor that Evergreen would much rather work with Laxus than with Gray.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Team Up With: Kagura Mikazuchi</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kagura.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fairy-tail-kagura-little-known-facts-grand-magic-games/\">Kagura</a> belongs to the all-female Mermaid Heel guild, and she is by a mile the most powerful wizard under that banner. Kagura is a swordfighter on par with <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fairy-tail-erza-facts-trivia-info/\">Erza</a>, and in some cases, her technique actually surpasses Erza's own.

She is an agile melee fighter who uses cat-like techniques in battle, including claws and a long, tail-like tube that can capture enemies.</p><p>Ultimately, though, Millianna's power level is too far below Gray's, and her silly personality wouldn't work well with Gray's more serious disposition. Instead, Millianna would have a better time with Natsu or Lucy on a mission.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Team Up With: Sting Eucliffe</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sting-09.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fairy-tail-unknown-facts-sting-eucliffe/\">Sting</a> is one of the two dragon slayers of the Sabertooth guild, the other being Rogue. They work best together in a light/shadow combo, but either of them could work with Natsu or Gray during a mission. Or, if Sting teamed up with Gray, he'd simply bring Rogue along.</p><p>Sting and Rogue are ferocious but fight with a purpose, and they are tenacious and loyal in combat. Gray will definitely like that, and these dragon slayers are on par with Gray's own combat skills. They'd make for a fine team.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Reject: Kain Hikaru</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kain-hikaru.jpg' /></figure><p>Kain Hikaru is a rather sadistic fellow, and sure enough, he is a member of a dark guild. In this case, Grimoire Heart. He's among the weakest members, but he does have unique magic that's centered around a voodoo doll named Mr. Cursey.</p><p>If Kain takes his enemies by surprise, he can really get the edge on them, but this isn't how Gray fights, and Gray would find Kain's methods distasteful and dishonorable. Kain's goofy and slightly arrogant personality would also rub Gray the wrong way.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/anime-like-fairy-tail/\">15 Anime to Watch If You Love Fairy Tail</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:30:52 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gray-would-and-wouldnt-team-up-with-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"8a04a131e33781b007a9591f8771f1aa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-10-480_bd20f332f76a8493.webp","destWidth":1800,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":85240,"destBytes":85240,"author":"Louis Kemner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gray-would-and-wouldnt-team-up-with-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-10-480_bd20f332f76a8493.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/juvia-happy-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn99@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-31-009_5063a8bc3df08ad6.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/natsu-2-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-30-174_4996d75585b92dc5.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Panther-lily-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn12@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-32-190_2c903a1ab49f36d2.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/minerva-sad.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn69@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-32-293_2bd54221c13b36b0.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucy-smart.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-25-255_2d3ef476f14e1ac0.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/evergreen-fairy-tail.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn23@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-22-576_c6e98a831a96abd7.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kagura.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-30-681_71709bb44a8b7462.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/millianna.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn79@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-21-211_c28e985aa09dbeb3.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sting-09.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-21-160_7f9a5030c60594e6.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kain-hikaru.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-30-217_28d6f7e0c469ee80.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389173},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"X-Men: Has Marvel's New Illuminati Already Infiltrated Krakoa?","link":"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-marvel-illuminati-selene-krakoa/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selene.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/empyre\"><strong>Empyre: X-Men</strong></a><em><strong> #2, by Gerry Duggan, Ben Percy, Leah Williams, Lucas Werneck, Nolan Woodard and VC's Clayton Cowles, on sale now.</strong></em></p><p>The Power Elite are quickly becoming one of the most dangerous groups in the Marvel Universe.

Despite that -- and accommodations to ensure that her vampiric needs are met -- Selene has broken that second rule in the pages of <em>Captain America</em>, where the psychic vampire has been feeding on the souls of men.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/necrosha-x-men-undead-battle/\">Necrosha: The X-Men's Horrific Battle With the Undead, Explained</a></span></p><p>Professor X said all mutants must abide by the laws of the mutant society.

After being given Ronan the Accuser's hammer, the Universal Weapon, Carol was named the new Kree Supreme Accuser. Her first mission was to travel to a planet that was once home to a city where both Kree and Skrulls lived in peace and harmony. However, the city was completely destroyed, and there were no survivors. Carol was sent to find the warrior responsible for this terrible act, and dispose of them.</p><p>However, when she got there, she discovered that the suspect was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/captain-marvel-sister-innocent-empyre/\">a half-sister</a> she never knew she had. Laurie-Ell was clearly innocent, which prompted Carol to hide her on Earth while she searched for the truth. To make matters worse, the Universal Weapon in her grasp proved to have an influence on her. Therefore, to make certain she could remain under constant watch, she asked Doctor Strange to split the cosmic hammer into four.</p><p>With this, Captain Marvel assembled her own team of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/captain-marvel-new-team-cosmic-avengers/\">Avengers</a> comprised of War Machine, Hazmat, and Spider-Woman -- and every one of them has their own glowing green hammer.

Luckily, Carol already has another suspect in mind in the form of Walter Lawson, aka Wastrel.</p><p>Walter was recently imprisoned by the Kree, and Captain Marvel ran into him in the previous issue of the series. There, Lawson told her he was working through his prison sentence with community service, but that turned out to be a lie. In <em>Captain Marvel</em> #20, Carol and her team return to K'in-al to find the villain.</p><p>And once they arrive, it isn't long before they are attacked by Wastrel's lethal inventions. Wastrel has made a name for himself by designing terrible weapons and he is up to his old tricks again: Carol, Rhodey, Jennifer, and Jessica are all attacked by giant robots armed with alien weaponry.</p><p>These robots are incredibly dangerous, but they give the superheroes a chance to cut loose and test out their new abilities as Accusers. Each of them combines their powers with those of their replicas of the Universal Weapon, and the results are nothing short of astonishing.

Created by Gerry Conway, Don Newton and Gene Colan, he's been fashioned as a metahuman with a reptilian skin disorder that gives him super-strength and rigid exterior, which makes him a straight-up crocodile on the outside. This issue addresses his past in a sideshow years ago where he was one of the main attractions who suffered abuse for his looks.</p><p>When we see Croc in the present, he is attempting to hold up a Gotham bank. As he orders the guards to fetch the money, he accosts the manager, Julie. When she calls him by name, his memory's jogged to when he was in the cage and her dad was actually the show's promoter. \"Gator Boy\" was his nickname, and everyone bullied him except for Julie who fends one of them off. She didn't hold her dad's views and felt sorry for Waylon, treating him like a person, not a creature. She always inquired how he was doing on the inside and helped him feel more human.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-gotham-nights-almost-destroys-gordon/\">Batman: Gotham Nights Almost Destroys Jim Gordon With the Perfect Crime</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/croc-3.jpg\"/></figure><p>But when they parted ways -- he escaped after she and her dad left the circus -- Croc never got back in contact with her. He tried to find Julie, but she knew he was lost when she saw the news about him being a criminal. It's why she pierces his skin with some shots of the truth when he tries to emotionally connect with her after finding her during a robbery. While she admits that she did care for him, he ultimately proved her wrong and everyone else right. He had the opportunity time after time to walk away from this life of crime but he chose to remain in it, hunting score after score.</p><p>Now presented with the monster before her, Julie doesn't hold the same compassion she had for the person Croc was. To her, the boy she knew is dead, and it's why she tells him he really has become the monster everyone said he would be. Croc's heartbroken as he realizes that what she said is true. Although she'll never understand what he went through before and after meeting, her but Croc really had ample chances to turn a new leaf, instead opting to remain a criminal.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-best-dad-damian-wayne/\">Batman: Gotham Nights Turned Bruce Wayne from the Worst Dad to the Best</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:20:18 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Batman-feature-Detective-Comics.jpg","linkMd5":"d97f08a5b7fd4d34c82880a893ed06b8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-20-071_49980621feb8f8f6.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":133228,"destBytes":133228,"author":"Renaldo Matadeen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Batman-feature-Detective-Comics.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-20-071_49980621feb8f8f6.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/croc-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-34-219_7ffd717ea0e82dfb.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/croc-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-31-003_bbc6b11faa4a06e9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389179},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Marvel Introduces Mister Fantastic/Galactus Fusion, Mr. Galactic","link":"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-mister-fantastic-galactus-mr-galactic/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mr-galactic-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>Mark Waid and Neal Adams are set to join forces in the pages of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/fantastic-four/\">Fantastic Four: Antithesis</a></em>. Apparently, this legendary writer/artist duo aren't the only ones joining forces ---Mister Fantastic and Galactus will also be teaming up.</p><p>The synopsis for the third issue reads, \"Without Galactus, there’s only one way the Fantastic Four can hope to stall the threat of Antithesis – by absorbing the Power Cosmic to multiply their abilities a thousandfold!\"</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/scarlet-spiders-debut-wasnt-in-spider-man/\">The Scarlet Spider's '90s Animated Debut Wasn't in an Episode of Spider-Man</a></span></p><p>The solicit for the fourth issue is as follows:</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FFANTITHESIS2020004-Cov-1.jpg\"/></figure><blockquote><p>FANTASTIC FOUR: ANTITHESIS #4 (of 4)MARK WAID (W) • NEAL ADAMS (A/C)Variant cover by RUSSELL DAUTERMANReed Richards has made the ultimate sacrifice to save the cosmos from both Antithesis and Galactus, dooming himself to a life among the stars!

Over the course of three acts, fans have only got to witness some skirmishes in the arc which, while good, could've been expanded upon a little further.</p><p>In terms of fights, the Wano Country arc needs to step up.

This is, undoubtedly, the biggest war in <em>One Piece</em> so far that the fans will witness.

Not only did this give fans information on Wano Country and how it operated long ago but it also gave everyone a glimpse of the Rocks Pirates, Whitebeard, Roger, and most importantly, the Final Island, Laugh Tale.</p><p>Oden's battle with Kaido was remarkable and the Legendary Hour was nothing short of mind-blowing.

He pulled the country into an era of darkness which has been described as \"Long Winter\" by the author of the story.</p><p>Recently, Orochi was killed off by Kaido; however, some believe that those who wanted to avenge Oden should've done the deed. Of course, all hope isn't lost yet as Orochi could very well have survived.

However, an argument can be made that the clashes that everyone got to witness during this arc could have been handled better and expanded upon.</p><p>Simply put, Marineford was a bit of a mess where no fight got any proper attention. With Wano, fans hope that Oda doesn't do something similar, especially since <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-wano-better-marineford/\">the scale of this war is even bigger than Marineford</a>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>The Best: Hint The One Piece</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/one-piece-poneglyph-robin-1.jpg' /></figure><p>As has been confirmed before, the end to the Wano Country arc will give the fans <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/well-thought-out-fan-theories-meaning-location-one-piece-ridiculous/\">a hint about what the One Piece treasure is</a>. The treasure will, of course, not be revealed until Luffy reaches Laugh Tale, however, it will certainly be hinted once the Wano Country arc ends.</p><p>With that in mind, Wano is, unquestionably, going to end as one of the greatest arcs in the entire story, if not the greatest.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Needs To Do Better: Killing Off The Villain</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kaido-in-one-piece.jpg' /></figure><p>Eiichiro Oda doesn't like to kill off his characters.

First of all, their audiences are very different, and they are even in completely different genres. However, just like how fans enjoy sorting characters from other stories into Hogwarts Houses, it can be a fun thought exercise to treat bending elements in a similar way.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-waterbending-guide-facts/\">Avatar: 10 Things Fans Should Know About Waterbending</a></span></p><p>So, we’ve created a list of the main characters from <em>The Office</em> and match them with what element they would bend based on their personality and temperament.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Darryl Philbin: Fire</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Craig-Robinson-as-Darryl-Philbin-on-The-Office-1.jpg' /></figure><p>The element of fire in <em>Airbender</em> is one that is often really misunderstood as always being an aggressive or scary thing. However, this isn’t the case at all. Just like in astrology, fire benders can have all kinds of personality traits, but they are characterized by an overall passion and drive for life.</p><p>This is why Darryl matches best with fire because he is one of the most ambitious and driven characters on the show.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Holly Flax: Water</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Holly-Flax-The-Office.jpg' /></figure><p>Holly Flax isn’t always a main character in the show, but she is a very influential one. She matches best with the element of water because while she has a rather lighthearted side like an air bender and a practical side like an earth bender, she is overall fairly emotionally based and goes with the flow.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-office-jim-pam-good-relationship-toxic/\">The Office: 10 Characters More Obnoxious Than Michael Scott</a></span></p><p>This doesn’t mean she is weak at all, and she’s in fact rather in touch with her emotions in a healthy way.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Ryan Howard: Air</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ryan-howard-as-ceo.jpg' /></figure><p>In <em>Airbender</em>, air bending is often associated with some of the best and most morally upstanding characters, but the element of air isn’t always used by people with calm personalities.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-air-temples-secrets-trivia/\">Air is an element often associated with intellect</a>, but it can also be associated with the inability to decide and flightiness. This is why Ryan is an air bender as he’s one of the most fickle characters from the series.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Karen Filippelli: Earth</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-Karen-The-Office.jpg' /></figure><p>Karen Filippelli has many great traits that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-earthbending-trivia/\">earth benders</a> and earth zodiac signs have. For one thing, she is overall very stable and practical, but this doesn’t make her boring.</p><p>She can be rather stubborn and stands up for herself which are two admirable traits that earth benders are known for. She also is much more grounded and reasonable than many of the other characters on the show.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Jan Levinson: Fire</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Melora-Hardin-as-Jan-Levinson-on-The-Office.jpg' /></figure><p>While Darryl might be a great example of the positive aspects of a fire bender, Jan is an example of many of the worst. She is rather self-absorbed and erratic, and she leads with her emotions and anger in a way that is unhealthy.</p><p>She can also be extremely blunt to the point of being rude, and she doesn’t have a lot of self-control.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Angela Martin: Non-bender</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-angela-the-office.jpg' /></figure><p>Angela definitely wouldn’t be a bender at all because she’s someone who would hate to have anything abnormal or special about her.

He combines many of the good traits of fire bending such as ambition and passion as well as some of the bad traits such as being quick to anger and too blunt at times.</p><p>He isn’t grounded enough or compassionate enough to be an earth or water bender, so fire makes the most sense.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Pam Beesly: Water</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Office-Pam-Beasley-Halpert.jpg' /></figure><p>Pam Beesly is a perfect example of the lament of water because she’s compassionate, emotional, and overall calm.</p><p>However, just like with many water benders, despite being associated with a gentle, flowing element, she’s not weak. Water can be extremely powerful, and it’s often an element that is underestimated.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Jim Halpert: Earth</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jim-Halpert-in-The-Office-the-job-opportunity-.jpg' /></figure><p>Jim Halpert would be a good fit with <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-metalbending-facts-trivia/\">earth bending</a> given his personality.

And in addition to his origin being retold, this version of the Man of Steel has also undergone a distinct change in art style compared to previous animated outings.</p><p>The characters of <em>Man of Tomorrow</em> are visibly accentuated by bolder, heavier line worker, that makes them pop a bit more from the backgrounds, and the overall light and color palette for Metropolis is noticeably brighter and more vibrant than in the recently concluded DC Animated Movie Universe.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-long-halloween-two-part-animated-film-confirmed/\">Batman: The Long Halloween - Two-Part Animated Film Adaptation Confirmed</a></span></p><p>According to director Chris Palmer, this change in style was inspired by the animated series that came before the film, as well as the comic books themselves.</p><p>\"I think it definitely evokes the original Superman animated series. It's kind of in the building blocks of Metropolis itself that this could be 25, 3o years in the future where while there's a lot of things you know, there's little points of departure like, 'Oh, I hope the world could be like that!'\" Palmer tells CBR. \"For the line art, it was to try something new, just definitely give a big stamp on it that this is a different world from the previous films.

Universes. While Wonder Woman has traditionally lacked this trope in her rogues' gallery, one new villain was just introduced who can steal even the Amazon's powers.</p><p>Named Julian Red, the would-be crook turns what seems like a failed robbery into the steal of a lifetime as she steals some of Wonder Woman's powers in <em>Wonder Woman: Agent of Peace </em>#11.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-national-sisters-day-olivier-coipel-wonder-woman-nubia-art/\">DC Celebrates National Sisters Day With Olivier Coipel's Wonder Woman/Nubia Art</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/julian-red-wonder-woman.jpg\"/></figure><p>The issue begins with Wonder Woman under siege from a villain with seemingly even more power than her, before it's revealed that she actually has Wonder Woman's powers. Diana recounts how her ordeal began, starting with her stopping the heist of a local jewelry store. The store is held up by a gang of robbers led by Julian Red, who manages to obtain a mysterious ruby from the store's safe. Wonder Woman arrives and makes quick work of the robbery, but is too late to keep Red away from the ruby. Giving herself over willingly, Red says an incantation while holding the gem before touching Wonder Woman.</p><p>Diana thinks nothing of it, seeing Red off to the police and the courts before researching more about the artifact itself. Named the Alicut Star Ruby, it apparently came into being in ancient Egypt and quickly became the subject of incredibly violent bouts for acquisition. Vied for by the Egyptians, Persians and even during World War II, the gem can apparently grant its bearer the power of its opponents, perhaps even draining them dry. This works just as well on magical metahumans, as Wonder Woman discovers that not only has the newly empowered Red escaped from prison but that her own powers are fading.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder_woman_loves_anime/\">Wonder Woman Loves Anime - And She's Not Alone</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wonder-woman-julian-red.jpg\"/></figure><p>Julian Red revels in her new powers, using her flight and superhuman senses to hunt down Wonder Woman. Red apparently has a vendetta against all those in the world that have wronged her in some way and wishes to first take it out on Wonder Woman by siphoning the rest of her powers. Wonder Woman tries to put some distance between them to keep this from happening, traveling through the sewers into the zoo. With only her bracelets and armor to protect her, Wonder Woman is otherwise helpless against Red, who now has almost all of her demigoddess powers.</p><p>One underlooked ability of Wonder Woman's, the power to talk to wildlife, is still in Diana's possession, however. Having taken the Alicut Star Ruby off of Red's person, Diana tosses it toward two now-loose panthers. Red scoffs and attempts to misuse Wonder Woman's powers to command the cats to kill her, but to no avail. Having read of the ruby's powers, especially pertaining to its cat patron, Diana then realizes that both the gem and the panthers will sense the evil in Red's heart. This causes Wonder Woman's powers to instantly return to her, dropping the depowered and helpless Red. Wonder Woman promptly has the panthers attack her but asks them to let her live.</p><p>Wonder Woman discusses with the detective who apprehends Red that Julian apparently had a hard life. Having been ostracized both in work and in her personal life, she eventually withdrew from society before turning to crime to acquire literal and figurative power. Having all of her powers back, Diana requests that the villainess be psychologically rehabilitated before destroying the gem in a volcano. It's unknown how the ruby transferred Wonder Woman's god-given powers to Red, but it certainly won't be doing it again.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jinny-hex-crush-on-wonder-woman/\">A Young Justice Hero Has a Crush on Wonder Woman</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:20:54 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wonder-woman.jpg","linkMd5":"54db27f9e9ecefc88fcb3854ecfcfa4c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-09-345_4dadf6bcf3c626b1.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":166010,"destBytes":166010,"author":"Timothy Donohoo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wonder-woman.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-09-345_4dadf6bcf3c626b1.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/julian-red-wonder-woman.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn51@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-27-167_471949a630aecc86.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wonder-woman-julian-red.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn60@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-26-340_2ead3feace4a66ba.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389171},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"The Vampire Diaries: Who Is Damon & Stefan's Mother, Lily? | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/the-vampire-diaries-who-is-lily/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-vampire-diaries/\"><em>The Vampire Diaries</em></a> mentioned Lily Salvatore, mother of Damon and Stefan, only in passing until Season 6. While she presumably died at some point in 1858, it was discovered that she was alive; however this wasn't good news for the Salvatore brothers, who were left dealing with the ramifications of this revelation. With this revelation, let's look back at how she went from gentle mother to a \"new\" woman with a \"family\" of her own.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries-Lily-Salvatore.jpg\"/></figure><p>Born as Lilian on February 27, 1820, she married Giuseppe Salvatore, who was a cheating, abusive husband. Once, during Thanksgiving 1851, she tried to run away to New York with her sons and bought the tickets with the money she stole from Giuseppe, who beat Lily for trying to take his sons. He threatened she would never see her kids again if she made another attempt to runaway. In 1858, she suffered from tuberculosis and was sent to a hospital by Giuseppe, but Damon and Stefan weren't allowed to talk to her.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries-Lily-Salvatore-k.jpg\"/></figure><p>In the hospital, a vampire gave her their blood, turning her. While she did return to Mystic Falls to see her sons, Stefan's pulse triggered her bloodlust, so she left so before hurting her kids. Lily proceeded to go on a killing spree across Europe, with a death count of more than 3,000 people.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/legacies-damon-salvatore-elena-gilbert-stefanie/\">Legacies Should Introduce Damon Salvatore and Elena Gilbert's Daughter</a></span></p><p>She soon met former members of the Gemini Coven, who had been cast out since they were siphoners, meaning they could only use magic after they drained it from someone else. While she eventually met young Valerie and Oscar, she would soon meet Mary Louise, Nora and Beau. During her killing rounds, she also met and fell in love with Julian, a charming vampire.</p><p>In 1863, she sent Julian and Valerie to check in on Stefan, but Valerie and Stefan fell in love, and Valerie got pregnant. Julian knew having a grandchild would tear Lily away from her new \"family,\" so he beat Valerie till she miscarried. Valerie later committed suicide, unable to refute Julian's story that he found her beaten on the road. However, she died with Lily’s blood in her system, so she woke up as the first Heretic, a witch-vampire hybrid.</p><p>Later, Lily transformed the remaining five witches, with whom she planned to kill the Gemini Coven. While Julian was killed, his soul trapped in the Phoenix stone by vampire huntress Rayna Cruz, the coven sent the remaining vampires to the Prison World, where they were stuck in 1903 forever without any source of blood. Lily's family decided to give up their rations to keep Lily alive while they died.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/vampire-diaries-lj-smith-forbidden-game-best-book/\">The Vampire Diaries: L.J.

Later, when Damon ran out of ways to turn on Stefan’s humanity in Season 6, he and Bonnie rescued Lily, tricking her into thinking that they would come back for her companions.</p><p>Coached by Damon, she managed to convince Stefan that she tried to come back for them but was imprisoned by the Gemini Coven. Her admission pushed Stefan to turn on his humanity, but when Damon and Bonnie went back on their promise of rescuing her companions, she lost her composure. This lead to her murdering many, attacking Bonnie and Elena and sparing Joe, who was pregnant.</p><p>She was later overpowered by Damon and Stefan and imprisoned; however, Kai rescued her and brought her family back from the Prison World. For their protection, she brokered a deal with Stefan. This meant Mystic Falls was vacated and given to her and her family so they could feed on anyone who crossed the town’s borders.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/vampire-diaries-why-elena-thinks-she-met-stefan-first/\">The Vampire Diaries: Why Elena Thinks She Met Stefan First (When Really It Was Damon)</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries-Lily-Julian.jpg\"/></figure><p>While she had a strained relationship with Damon, especially after learning she prompted Kai to cast a sleeping spell on Elena, Lily bonded with Stefan. This bond was tested when she resurrected Julian via the Phoenix stone, so Stefan learned he killed his unborn child.</p><p>He tried killing Julian, but the older vampire was stronger and extremely manipulative. Julian convinced Lily to link their life forces, so her sons wouldn't kill him. Although Stefan told Lily what Julian did to Valerie, his true character came through when he got in a sword fight with Enzo, despite knowing every wound inflicted on him would harm her as well. His superfluous claim that he loved her reminded Lily of the abusive Giuseppe, allowing her to see Julian for the monster he really was.</p><p>She joined forces with her sons to convince her family to help kill Julian; however, Mary Louise helped Julian hold Damon and Valerie captive, forcing Lily to stake herself in hopes of killing Julian. This backfired because Mary Louise severed the link between them. Julian ran away while Lily started to die. Everyone said tearful goodbyes, but Damon refused to accept her apology. Lily was laid to rest near the Salvatore family plot.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-vampire-diaries-how-damon-stefan-became-vampires/\">The Vampire Diaries: How Damon and Stefan Became Vampires</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 11:45:23 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries.jpg","linkMd5":"f44bd4458bff231a7ef9cb7ade68a620","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-11-521_0a575cd77e520c09.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":121680,"destBytes":121680,"author":"Apeksha Bagchi","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-11-521_0a575cd77e520c09.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries-Lily-Salvatore.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn16@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-22-101_838b55aa96d8a242.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries-Lily-Salvatore-k.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-23-600_5c6668359ee5661e.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries-Stefan-Lili.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn83@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-27-421_eb050cd483c933e6.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Vampire-Diaries-Lily-Julian.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-32-214_3797cd15b9f6289e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389185},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Lovecraft Country: Atticus Reunites With [Spoiler] but at a Great Cost","link":"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-episode-2-atticus-reunite-montrose-kills-off-george/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lovecraft-Country-Motion-Poster.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/lovecraft-country/\">Lovecraft Country</a> Season 1, Episode 2, \"Whitey's on the Moon,\" which aired Sunday on HBO.</strong></em></p><p>HBO's new horror series <em>Lovecraft Country</em> began with main characters Atticus Freeman, his uncle George and their friend Letitia Lewis leaving Chicago to search for Montrose Freeman. Montrose -- who is Atticus' estranged father -- disappeared quite some time ago, yet a letter indicated that he was located in the sleepy New England town of Ardham, Massachusetts. After enduring <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-historical-roots-scariest-scene/\">racist sheriffs and monstrous vampires</a>, the trio reached their destination. In the latest episode of <em>Lovecraft Country</em>, they locate Montrose, but suffer a heartbreaking loss during their rescue attempt.</p><p>After Atticus and his party are <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-introduces-cult/\">welcomed into an eerie and unsettling palatial estate</a>, the young Korean War veteran realizes they were lured there, with Montrose serving as bait. Permitted to visit the nearby town under the condition that they return in time for dinner, Atticus and George notice a large stone tower. George observes its foundations and realizes there's an underground sub-basement, which is the most likely location of Montrose. However, before the trio can investigate further, they are warded off by a racist woman with a pair of guard dogs and escorted back to the estate by Christina Braithwaite, the daughter of Samuel Braithwaite, owner of the mansion and leader of its religious cult the Sons of Adam.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-outdone-stranger-things-one-way/\">Lovecraft Country Has Already Outdone Stranger Things in One Huge Way</a></span></p><p>After being confined to their respective bedrooms by magical barriers and tormented with visions of their worst fears by dark magic, Atticus and the others coordinate an escape after George discovers a secret passage in his room. Venturing back to the imposing stone tower, the trio break into the sub-basement and discover it does indeed house a cell. Montrose, though, has already used a secret tunnel to escape. Montrose soon meets up with the group, reuniting with his family. However, magic prevents the group from leaving Ardham for good, and Samuel shoots Letitia and George to coerce Atticus into participating in an ancient ritual led by the cult.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Courtney-B-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>After Atticus complies with Samuel's demands, the cult leader heals Leti with the promise to do the same for George should the ritual prove successful. As Montrose and Leti tend to the gravely wounded man, Atticus is used by the Sons of Adam to open a portal to the biblical paradise of Eden, with the young man's secret bloodline used to fuel the ceremony. The ritual backfires, killing many of the cultists, including Samuel. The estate also implodes, though Atticus and the others are able to make a desperate escape. Still, this frantic flight causes George's wounds to worsen, and he succumbs to his injuries, leaving the others to mourn for him.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-series-premiere-shoggoth-explainer/\">Lovecraft Country: What are the Shoggoth, the Series’ First Monsters?</a></span></p><p>From the outset, it was clear that George played a paternal role in Atticus' life, giving his nephew his deep love in literature and counsel that his distant father was never capable of. George's death has already visibly left both Atticus and Montrose grief-stricken and sure to haunt them as the series continues. As the trio sets out for their return to Chicago, the death could either bring the father and son closer together than they had ever been or estrange them further.</p><p><em>Starring Jonathan Majors, Jurnee Smollett, Aunjanue Ellis, Abbey Lee, Jada Harris, Wunmi Mosaku and Michael K.

There's a connection between the company who made the components of the bomb and Daisuke's family -- they just have to figure out what it is. However, if it looks like even the millionaire detective has run into a brick wall, how can they solve this case?</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millionaire-detective-daisukes-unlimited-balance-gets-limited/\">Millionaire Detective: Daisuke's 'Unlimited' Balance Gets...Limited?</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-haru-ep-6.jpg\"/></figure><p>Because the suspect, Ricardo, died during the investigation process, the Modern Crimes team undergo an inquiry by the justice department. Although his team appeared supportive, as soon as they hear they may lose their jobs, their fingers immediately point at <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millionaire-detective-episode-3-humor-tension-combo-satisfying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Haru</a>, who is taken off the case.</p><p>Chosuke is launching his own investigation into Mizuo Future Technologies, the company that may be responsible for developing the radio jamming device and the toxic gas cartridge. Chosuke's colleague tells him that an odd green seagrape substance that is being used as classified military technology may be what's being used to cause both the wireless and wire interferences. Chosuke's friend warns him not to get in too deep.</p><p>During dinner, Chosuke tells Haru that he wants to solve a cold case related to Mizuo before he retires and asks Haru if he wants to help. Haru accepts, and the two of them confront Imura for answers about the sea grapes substance. She remains tight-lipped, leaving them no choice but to leave.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-haru-daisuke-staircase.jpg\"/></figure><p>Imura gets into her <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-robin-joker-beat-up-stole-batmobile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fancy car</a> and drives off, not noticing one of Daisuke's gadgets is following her. Suddenly, her car speeds up t0 120km/h without any way to slow down. Careening into a parking lot, her car slams into a passerby. Daisuke is close behind and arrests her for reckless driving and killing the passerby. As she gets into his car to be taken to the police station, Daisuke switches off the gadget so the illusion in her windshield disappears.</p><p>He seizes the opportunity to interrogate her about the bomb. He asks who's in charge of making the cartridge, the material, if the company was using Poliador Kambe Ltd. to illegally import it and if she knows Shigemaru Kambe, all the while ignoring her demands for a lawyer. When she refuses to talk, he goes through her laptop and unlocks almost all of her files with HEUSC. Daisuke asks HEUSC to open a file called ADM, but the AI butler says he's not authorized.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millionaire-detective-fixes-superhero-collateral-damage-complaint/\">Millionaire Detective 'Fixes' A Common Superhero Genre Complaint</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-haru-chosuke.jpg\"/></figure><p>Haru confronts Daisuke at the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millionaire-detective-episode-3-suzue-identity-revealed/\">staircase</a> and asks him why he's going to such lengths. He admits that though he disagrees with how he operates, he has faith in Daisuke catching criminals. Daisuke tells him to stay out of it. It's interesting that this is in the same locations Haru once said that someone like Daisuke shouldn't be a cop, and yet he's in a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millionaire-detective-episode-3-strong-partnership/\">completely different place</a> now, having worked with Daisuke for some time and realizing he's not as bad as he seems.</p><p>Meanwhile, the director tells Chosuke to retire quietly and not meddle anymore, but Chosuke tells Haru that exposing Imura's secrets is justice. Chosuke lies to Imura that her lawyer is there and takes her to another room devoid of surveillance cameras. He almost successfully blackmails her into talking using photos of her son doing drugs. She gives up and asks to call her boss before talking.</p><p>Satisfied, Chosuke leaves the room to see Haru waiting and tells him the only way for justice to prevail is to get your hands dirty. Haru tells him that he can't accept this underhanded way of doing it. Frustration boiling over, Chosuke explodes on Haru, but Haru lets Imura out.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-haru-director.jpg\"/></figure><p>Imura and her lawyer leave and are about to leave in her car when she notices something wrong with the battery.

With a grim face, the director opens Chosuke's locker and reveals a wooden panel written \"Sayuri Kambe Murder Case/Investigation Headquarters.\" It's unclear who orchestrated the explosion. Was it was her company or the Kambe family?

As it turns out, Raimi replaced Universal Pictures' cut of <em>Darkman</em> with his own at the last minute.</p><p>Universal wanted to edit <em>Darkman</em> without Raimi's involvement in an attempt to boost preview scores. However, producer Robert Tapert explained to <em><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/darkman-turns-30-liam-neeson-frances-mcdormand-and-more-remember-the-arduous-making-of-sam-raimis-influential-superhero-film\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">THR</a></em> that editor Bud S. Smith was hired to re-arrange Raimi's initial two-hour cut, which he agreed to do on the condition that he was given some space, editing the film while Raimi and Tapert were briefly away in Florida. This new 85-minute cut didn't work, though. \"We tested that, and it did not test as well as the longer version, which was Sam's cut,\" Tapert said. \"I think we went through four or five more test screenings, and each time the score got lower and lower, and we got more depressed.\"</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/raimi-spider-man-trilogy-different-story-villains/\">Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy Originally Had a VERY Different Story, Villains</a></span></p><p><em>Darkman</em> composer Danny Elfman similarly described himself as \"pissed\" at Universal's decision, to the point that he \"threatened to take my name off the film and return my fee\" if Raimi's version wasn't restored. His main point of contention was the studio's desire to remove so many of <em>Darkman</em>'s weirder elements, as Elfman felt that \"This crazy stuff is what makes the film.\"</p><p>However, with Universal prepared to go forward with the Smith cut anyway, Raimi and Tapert chose to re-edit <em>Darkman</em> under two days without anyone's knowledge. From how Tapert described the decision, \"We were incredibly disheartened and dispirited. And Sam’s present editor, a guy by the name of Bob Murawski, said, 'There is a much better movie than what we are locking right now.' So, the decision was made that we would re-edit the movie. We spent 48 hours basically re-cutting the entire movie, restoring things we thought were important. We added nine minutes back in, things we really liked that the preview audiences would recoil from, but that was what it was meant to do. We locked it — and didn’t tell anybody.\"</p><p>Despite Universal's outrage, Raimi and Tapert's last-minute decision made it impossible to stop the film negatives from being prepared for critics.

But that's enough preamble - here are some of the most hilarious Lucifer Morningstar memes to grace the internet.</span></p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>The Greatest Army</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme-lucifians.v1.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/crisis-infinite-earths-best-worst-cameos/\">cameo Lucifer had in </a></span><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/crisis-infinite-earths-best-worst-cameos/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> brought cheers of joy from the fanbase. <em>This </em>meme, however, puts together another crossover that would most definitely break the internet. What’s funny is that Lucifer wouldn’t really need a big, strong weapon or a conventional army.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, he claims his legion of adoring fans are more than enough to contend with either Loki’s army or the Avengers’ Hulk. Even funnier is how this is a statement that one can even imagine Lucifer himself uttering. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>It Finally Worked On Chloe</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucifer’s ability to make people admit their deepest desires can either be interpreted as<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-most-heroic-terrible-actions/\"> something heroic or even terrible</a>, but it’s never worked on Chloe. It’s not completely clear what her true desire is, although this meme makes a bold prediction.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to it, the thing Chloe wants the most is more Lucifer memes. Then again, it’s most likely that the creator of this meme has placed Chloe as the representation of all the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucifer </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fans, making it accurate since they do love these memes.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>The True Face Of The Devil</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-1.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most expect the devil to have a stare<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ghost-rider-most-powerful-spirits-vengeance-ranked/\"> like Ghost Rider exhibits in his many versions.</a> And while Lucifer does have his devil face, he generally uses the one that looks like a human. Considering all the Lucifer characters in media, it’s easy for a non-fan to be confused.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do away with this problem, this one borrows the all-too-classic Magneto meme. To this end, he asks the “real” Lucifer to show himself, rejecting the classic devil and the one from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supernatural</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Now That's An Understanding Fellow</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-3.jpg' /></figure><p>Lucifer’s mannerisms seen in the TV series are derived from the comic book version, who is as suave as they come. This Lucifer keeps to himself and doesn’t feel the need to impose his will on anyone, regardless of his powers.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-mysteries-paid-off-well-didnt/\">Superman: 5 Mysteries That Paid Off Well (&#38; 5 That Didn't)</a></span></p></p><p>The funny thing is that he knows what humans are capable of, yet Lucifer is the least judgmental person ever. If any normal human knew the stuff Lucifer did, there’s no doubt they'd lack the devil's humility, strange as it is to say.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>High Quality Like No Other</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme-4k.v1.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of the real Lucifer, fans now consider the Tom Ellis version to be far and away the best one to have ever existed. This even includes the actual devil, meaning any other depiction of this being will always be considered inferior.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The person behind this meme has summarized this idea the best. As can be seen, the classic devil alongside a little girl barely qualifies as a 144p version of Lucifer, while the TV series version is glorious 4K quality by way of comparison.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>It's Always Daddy's Fault</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme-1.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">God is confirmed to be among<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-strongest-characters-multiverses/\"> the most powerful beings in the DC Universe</a> and is accepted to be the ultimate being in the TV series. Due to this, Lucifer figures that anything bad that happens to him has to be his father’s doing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This repetitive act of blaming God for every single thing is considered to be a recurring gag among fans, who now see it as a cute habit of Lucifer. So much so that even the fans have an inclination to pin the blame on God straight away even when there’s no evidence that he’s done anything at all.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Get A Clue, Chloe</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-2.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even after she saw Lucifer and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-amenadiel-every-power/\">Amenadiel’s powers on display</a> (not to mention the many times that Lucifer outright told Chloe that he was the devil) she refused to believe him. When she finally did find out the truth, Chloe ended up looking a bit silly.</span></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/supergirl-vs-superman/\">Supergirl Vs. Superman: Who Is Stronger?</a></span></p></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putting this in simple terms makes the situation look even funnier, seeing as Chloe didn’t have to decipher any clues since all she had to do was accept that Lucifer was telling the truth. The one behind this meme went a little further and put the ludicrousness of the situation in picture form.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>The Logic Of Humans</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-4.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unfortunate part about being the devil is the stereotype that comes along with it. Going by the personality that Lucifer has in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sandman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> series, he’s nothing like the idea of the conventional understanding of the devil in concept - evil and malicious.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fans know this very well, as Lucifer’s known to only punish the people who make it to Hell. Seeing as only bad humans arrive in this realm, Lucifer’s never hurt anyone that's actually a decent person. It’s too bad, then, that the good people themselves see him as the bad guy.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Classic Lucifer Mentality</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-5.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many romances in TV shows and comics, such as <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-mary-jane-peter-parker-gwen-stacy/\">Peter Parker and Mary Jane (or Gwen Stacy</a>), Lucifer and Chloe are known to jump through relatively ridiculous hoops. This usually comes in the form of Lucifer tarnishing his chances with her by doing something stupid.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to fans, his mentality can be summed up by what’s happening in this meme. As can be seen, Lucifer could easily take the route that gets him Chloe’s love, only for him to take a hard turn toward a surefire way of breaking both of their hearts.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>No Arguments Here</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-6.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the reasons why </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucifer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fans love the show so much is because certain things are possible only in this series. For instance, the fact that Lucifer can be seen reading a children’s book, which means the devil was trying to gain wisdom from material aimed at kids.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also the idea that the devil could run a nightclub. All this considered, it’s best not to argue with stuff in this series because the sheer entertainment value speaks for itself.</span></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dcamu-dc-characters-sad-werent-part-cinematic-universe-glad-left-out/\">DCAMU: 5 DC Characters We're Sad Weren't A Part Of This Cinematic Universe (&#38; 5 We're Glad Were Left Out)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:30:29 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lucifer-memes-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"5ad46d62dfcbd72a380107d8d18f83cc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-10-508_e2718280147e72e2.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":96888,"destBytes":96888,"author":"Saim Cheeda","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lucifer-memes-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-10-508_e2718280147e72e2.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme-lucifians.v1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn92@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-21-189_35e42d450d59d498.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-24-482_6405a460875cfb89.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-25-716_8eef2f3f6edba355.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-24-358_6603510283de180f.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme-4k.v1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn84@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-25-693_a7819e30af7d5dd0.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn27@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-23-528_780b48d065ee9086.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-25-079_e0d286e2e2088200.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn15@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-23-471_d43ebfcc20f287c9.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-29-613_624db6d2ab984083.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-meme.v1-6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-28-434_c0260e148a14d793.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389170},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"The Flash's New Movie Costume Is Already a Huge Improvement | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-new-movie-costume-already-huge-improvement/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flash-movie-new-costume-concept-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>Of the theatrical release of the film's many criticisms, one element of <em>Justice League </em>that was definitely disliked was the costume for the Flash. The Scarlet Speedster's iconic lithe, form-fitting red suit was reimagined as a bulky sort of plated armor, making him look like the <em>Injustice </em>Flash by way of Rob Liefeld. Rumors and mock-up suits suggested that the hero would be getting a second, more traditional costume, but this didn't come to pass in the movie that we got. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash-film/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Flash</a> solo movie finally seems to be picking up steam again, bolstered by renewed momentum in the DCEU following the announcement of the Snyder Cut's release.</p><p>Though a trailer for <em>The Flash </em>is still far off, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-movie-new-suit-concept-art-dc-fandome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">newly released concept art shows how the titular hero will appear in the movie</a>. The exact opposite of his costume in <em>Justice League, </em>this new costume is easily the Flash's best one yet.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/flash-warner-bros-embrace-dc-greatest-strength-multiverse/\">With The Flash, Warner Bros.

The suit will apparently be created by Batman, who appears with him in the concept art. The suit is far more streamlined than the previous version, with the bulky and awkward armor plating gone completely. In its place is a lightweight jumpsuit that bears a far stronger resemblance to the hero's traditional look. It also has several lines and grooves throughout that fill with light that could potentially be Speed Force energy.</p><p>This look is likely in homage to the New 52 design for the character, which added numerous lightning-filled lines through the Flash's body. The suit has an almost rubbery texture to it, further making it feel like a comic book costume come to life. This suit will probably allow Barry to more easily control his speed without having to worry about the friction that caused him to use the bulky armored suit. The suit may also have some extra function related to the lightning being emitted by its wearer, though it's likely just a visual effect.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-movie-new-costume-designed-which-batman/\">Batman Designed The Flash's New Movie Suit - But WHICH Batman?</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-flash-crisis-on-infinite-earths-600x389-Cropped-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Though it's going to be given to him by some version of Batman, the Flash's new suit may also be inspired by the character's interaction with his TV series counterpart. The CW's landmark crossover event <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths </em>not only crossed its heroes with other unrelated DC television properties of the past and present but also featured a small but pivotal appearance from Ezra Miller's version of the character. The two versions of Barry remark at how similar yet different they are compared to each other. The DCEU Flash had apparently not even taken a superhero name yet and was impressed with the name of the Arrowverse version. He also notes how much more breathable and comfortable his counterpart's costume appears to be.</p><p>It's this encounter that could not only lead to DCEU Barry taking the name of the Flash but also his traversing the multiverse. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/flash-flashpoint-film-michael-keaton-batman/\">Michael Keaton's Batman will appear in the film</a>, and it's possible that Barry will tell either him or the DCEU Batman about \"the other me\" to inspire one of them to create the suit. Regardless of which version of the Caped Crusader makes the suit, though, this is probably the best the Scarlet Speedster has ever looked outside of the comics.</p><p><em>Directed by Andy Muschietti with a script by Christina Hodson, The Flash stars Ezra Miller as Barry Allen.

Korra was physically and mentally weakened by the experience, and Katara discovered mercury lead poisoning in her system. Although progress was slow and Korra was angered by her suffering, Katara's wisdom about finding meaning through trauma helped Korra along with her process. It took a couple of years, but Katara helped Korra regain her physical strength and put her on the path of being the Avatar again.</p><p>Even in her advanced age and during her retirement in <em>The Legend of Korra</em>, Katara still played a big role as the wise mentor who set the next generation on the right path.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-is-aang-monk-anymore/\">Avatar: Is Aang Even A Monk Anymore?</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 10:45:28 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Katara-The-Legend-of-Korra.jpg","linkMd5":"f9f108f0e8e4c4a951c98caa58d4e323","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn4@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-09-331_5ef77eb61dade398.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":43874,"destBytes":43874,"author":"Michael McCarrick","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Katara-The-Legend-of-Korra.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn4@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-09-331_5ef77eb61dade398.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Avatar-Aang-Katara-.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn19@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-22-158_2d5dda3ffd805be9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389185},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Green Lantern: Every Lantern Corps (& The Emotions That Fuel Them)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/green-lanter-corps-color-emotions-explained/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lantern-Corps.jpg\"/></figure><p>Whether you are a Hal Jordan, Jon Stewart, or Kyle Rayner fan, everyone can agree that the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-green-lantern/\">Green Lantern</a> is one of the most notable characters in DC Comics.

And it's sort of outside of our own reality but other Strong Creatives go there to hang out, have a few beers and connect.</p><p>And I got kind of interested in that place. And I was thinking about, so in Season 1, Charlie underestimates Vic, and she's able to not only survive, but badly injure him and put him in jail. And I was thinking he's not going to underestimate her that way again. And with that in mind, he does have access to this bar where there are other powerful Creatives like him, other people who can twist reality. Maybe he can go and try and cut a deal with someone there. And I started to think who that might be, and came up with the Hourglass. And he became one more instrument for Charlie Manx to use to steal Wayne from Vic and to take his revenge.</p><p>And I think that's kind of exciting, and I think that if there was another season of <em>NOS4A2,</em> the Hourglass somewhat points the way towards what that season might look like. But, you know, there's this whole world out there, of people like Charlie Manx and Vic Queen. Some of them are good. Some of them are like Jolene in the first season with her roller skates. And some of them are very, very bad, people like Charlie or like the Hourglass. And, we've got, as Season 2 ends, we have Maggie following a thread that might lead her towards more people like the Hourglass. And it's not hard to imagine her finding one that maybe it would have been better to leave alone, and having to get the band back together to deal with a new menace.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NOS4A2-Maggie-Hourglass-Man.jpg\"/></figure><p><strong>One of the things Maggie learns from her interaction with the Hourglass Man is how she can use her powers without the negative side effects. </strong></p><p>Well, yeah. Did she really escape the negative side effects? She's putting cigarettes out on her arm to forestall seizures, so I'm not really sure that she's quite figured out how to use her powers without damaging herself. She just moved the damage in another direction.</p><p><strong>That's fair. Why did you originally conceive of the Strong Creatives' powers having these negative drawbacks?</strong></p><p>Yeah. Why did I decide on that? That's a good question. I mean, I guess I feel like I was trying to say that every good attribute a person has can be turned against them. And that there are costs..., all our choices come with price tags on them. I like the idea that the heroes of  <em>NOS4A2</em> could bend reality but that doing so would come with a hefty price tag, would incur damage on them. And I thought a lot about Charlie, who seems to be immortal. And I thought, well what's it cost, and then gradually I decided what it costs him was his soul.</p><p><strong>Is there any metaphorical basis in your experiences as a creative?</strong></p><p>You know, I talked with my dad once or twice. I wrestled with a lot of anxiety over the last decade. I'm in a really good place now, but I had a nervous breakdown in 2010 and got into therapy and on anti-anxiety medication. And I talked to my dad about that, and the thing is, I spend most of my time coming up with paranoid scenarios. That's <em>actually</em> my job. And, my dad says that that's like an instrument, like a tool with a very sharp edge, and it has to cut something, and if it's not cutting it's way through a story then it's cutting you. And in that you kind of have the seed of my thinking about Strong Creatives, I guess.</p><p>But I do think that I spend so much time thinking about worst-case scenarios that it can be difficult sometimes not to get lost in my own storyline. Not to feel like: oh this is going to happen to me and then this is going to happen to me, and then I'm going to be dead of coronavirus. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p><p><strong>I hope that doesn't happen too often!</strong></p><p>It's not so bad anymore. I've gotten a lot better at holding my own paranoid scenarios at arms' length.</p><p><strong>That's good to hear. </strong></p><p><strong>Maggie, as you said, is in the process of finding these Strong Creatives. Do you have any more ideas of who these individuals could be in your head?</strong></p><p>Oh yeah, there's always more. [<em>Laughs</em>] There's always more. I mean, I've talked off and on for years about writing another novella about Maggie, called <em>The Crooked Alley</em>. And I had a pretty clear idea for the story and when it would take place....</p><p>So the world of the novel and the world of the TV show are adjacent but not exactly the same. For example, the <em>NOS4A2</em> TV show, makes a couple radically different choices in the ending. At least one character in the TV show survives who dies in the book. In the world of the book, there is this story I would write about Maggie that takes place after Maggie has met Vic for the first time, but before Maggie has re-encountered Vic following the birth of Vic's son.</p><p><strong>That would be a lot of fun.</strong></p><p>Yeah, it would be cool. And I had this idea, ...I said, \"Look at all these kids who have left Christmasland. Don't they need a support group or something?\" And then I was thinking, wow, that would be pretty good. Imagine a support group of kids from Christmasland. They're all in the early 20s and stuff. I think that could be pretty good, especially if Millie starts coming after them for being quitters.</p><p><strong>Last time we talked you said you love visiting the Christmasland sets, and we spend a lot of time there in this last part of the season. Were you happy about that?</strong></p><p>Oh yeah, absolutely. I <em>love</em> spending time in the ice maze. I was hoping from the moment we decided we were going to do a <em>NOS4A2</em> TV show, that we would get to ride all the rides in Christmasland, so it's cool that the story finally got us there and that we were able to spend not one but two episodes really enjoying the place.</p><p>You know, the one story that's in the <em>NOS4A2</em> world that hasn't been explored yet, in the comic book <em>Wraith</em> there's a kind of <em>Con Air</em> in Christmasland story. And I'd still like to see that happen. I still think that would make a great standalone movie.</p><p><strong>At the end of Season 2, we have Millie Manx surviving and entering the real world, which I believe is inspired by an alternate ending you wrote for the book of <em>NOS4A2</em>. Is Millie's experience in the real world something you've been itching to explore more?</strong></p><p>So, in the published novel, the book ends, and then there's an acknowledgements page and there's an \"About the Author\" section. And then in the very back of the book, you see this in some books, there's \"About the Type,\" which talks about the font that the book was set in, the typeset for the book. But in <em>NOS4A2</em> that turns into a whole secret chapter about Christmasland about Millie Manx. And that hidden chapter, that sort of secret track in the book, becomes the ending in the TV show, except in the digital release of the final episode of Season 2, there's a hidden chapter in that. I don't believe it's going to be on the air on AMC, so there is a hidden track on the TV show as well on the digital release of it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NOS4A2-Vampire-children.jpg\"/></figure><p><strong>Well that's good to know.</strong></p><p>[<em>Laughs</em>] But I'm sure the moment it crops up on YouTube, AMC's copyright lawyers will be busy squashing it.... Let me just tell you, people are going to be shocked when Samuel Jackson shows up at Vic's house and asks if she wants to join the Avengers.</p><p><strong>That is going to be shocking, no one's going to see that coming. </strong></p><p>Total curveball.</p><p><strong>In Season 2, Millie became a major character who really had a lot of conflict. Did you see her going in that direction when the TV show started?</strong></p><p>Not necessarily, and I think that's more Jami's vision, but it's a good one, it's an exciting vision. You know, Jami and I wound up talking about <em>Pinocchio</em> a lot. <em>Pinocchio</em> was one of the landmarks I used to find my way through writing the novel. Christmasland is... analogous in some ways to Pleasure Island, a major location in <em>Pinocchio</em>. Pleasure Island is this place where little boys go to drink and smoke and gamble. And by indulging their worst behavior, they gradually turn into jackasses. And Christmasland is a little bit the same, only by indulging their worst behavior, kids turn into soulless vampires.</p><p>What's interesting about that is Jami took that reflection of <em>Pinocchio</em> and began to apply it to Millie. Millie has been a child of Christmasland for almost 100 years and has reached a point in Season 2 where she's started to wonder what she might have missed out on by never growing up. So there is this storyline in Season 2 about Millie Manx wanting to be a real girl, to grow up and become a real girl the same way Pinocchio wants to be a real boy. And that, I think, is very interesting. And if there was another season of <em>NOS4A2</em>, it would be interesting to see if Wayne can pull Millie into a life of humanity, if he can pull Millie towards humanity, or Millie succeeds in pulling Wayne back into monstrousness.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/nos4a2-season-2-trailer-christmasland/\">NOS4A2 Season 2 Trailer Welcomes You to Christmasland</a></span></p><p><strong>In the second season, we also get a second episode about <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/nos4a2-charlie-manx-origin-explained/\">Manx's backstory</a> when he was a child, but it differs a lot from the backstory in the graphic novel you wrote in that it makes Charlie a predator even when he was a kid. Did you feel that was an appropriate choice for the show?</strong></p><p>Well, he's something of an unknowing predator in the flashback sequence in the show. I think he's kind of pushed out of his mind what this owner of the toy store is doing to the kids that he recruits for him.... I go back to what was in the comic, which is this idea [of] Manx becoming a person who uses his reality to [form] powers to abduct children and keep them in a state of neverending innocence. I tried to show in the comic book how that was rooted in destruction of his own innocence and hatred for a mother who didn't protect him.</p><p>And I think you could spread that out to Manx's view of women as a whole, which is not very favorable. Charlie has a set of patriarchal views about women that are so extreme that they're poisonous, almost sociopathic. You know, you'd like to think that those are attitudes that fell out of date 100 years ago, but unfortunately, apparently not.</p><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qfw7w2ZZPNw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><em>NOS4A2 Season 2 stars Zachary Quinto, Ashleigh Cummings, Jonathan Langdon, Jason David, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, Virginia Kull, Jahkara Smith and Ebon Moss-Bachrach.</em></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/nos4a2s-paul-schneider-interview/\">NOS4A2: Paul Schneider on Bringing the Hourglass Man to Murderous Life</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 14:45:40 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NOS4A2-Vic-Maggie.jpg","linkMd5":"c0d3d532dde047913201e1a3e1f7467e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-10-385_ca20487e8644ad67.webp","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":650,"sourceBytes":75652,"destBytes":75652,"author":"Cynthia Vinney","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NOS4A2-Vic-Maggie.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-10-385_ca20487e8644ad67.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NOS4A2-Maggie-Hourglass-Man.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-30-321_50304b77955e6c21.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NOS4A2-Vampire-children.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn76@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-31-343_2bb8a9107bdb3d4a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389181},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Marvel: 10 Best Moon Knight Cosplay | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-moon-knight-best-cosplay/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/moon-knight-cosplay-featured.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/moon-knight/\">Moon Knight</a> may not be one of the most well known Marvel superheroes currently, given the success of the MCU juggernaut, but for his most ardent fans, he'll always be popular.

The suit looks more or less like a blue and grey <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/iron-man\">Iron Man</a> suit, with the iconic four in place of the arc reactor. The sketches give a front and back view, in addition to a look at how the suit stretches with Reed's body. It's cool, yes, but it also bears an unnerving similarity the final horrific product of Junji Ito's <em>The Enigma of Maigara Fault</em>.</p><p><em>The Enigma of Amigara Fault</em> is the story of two teens, Owaki and Yoshida, who hike Amigara Mountain following an earthquake in a nameless Japanese prefecture. A recent earthquake revealed a series of indeterminably deep holes in a cliff face, which are shaped exactly like specific human silhouettes. Many hikers have gone to the mountain in search of their hole, saying that when they saw the news story on TV, the hole called out to them.</p><p>One by one people begin to enter the holes, even though they know they will be lost inside the mountain, unable to move any way but forward. The holes have an irresistible draw that eventually overtakes Yoshida and Owaki. The story then jumps ahead by months, to reveal a group of scientists discovering a similar cliff face with similar holes -- only these holes are far more abstract shapes, incredibly long and spindly. One of the researchers looks inside and sees a horrific, completely stretched out human creature coming toward him from the darkness, still a perfect fit for the hole.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/scariest-stories-smashed-junji-ito-story-collection-ranked/\">The Scariest Stories in Smashed: Junji Ito Story Collection, Ranked</a></span></p><p>It is relatively common now for fans to recreate the panels of Ito's manga with popular characters like Mario, Plague Knight and Diglet. These panels have been memed. However, it is unlikely Marvel is making an intentional reference to Junji Ito.</p><p>This does, however, harken back to the roots of the Fantastic Four. While the group wasn't body horror per se, the idea of their mutations as being initially disturbing was a part of Stan Lee's original concept. Ben Grimm famously grappled with this in Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's classic, \"This Man... This Monster!,\" in which the darker side of the Thing's transformation is explored. The idea of the body horror inherent to Marvel's first family is also toyed with -- albeit unsuccessfully -- in Fox's 2015 <em>Fantastic Four</em> film.</p><p>Still, <em>Empyre</em> #5 makes it clear that it's better not to think too much about the properties of Mister Fantastic's semi-disturbing, bone-crunching anatomy.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Keep Reading: <a href=\"http://cbr.com/captain-america-greatest-leader/\">Captain America Is OFFICIALLY Marvel’s Greatest Leader</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:20:17 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Iron-Man-Junji-Ito-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"435db78fa69d3ff16b22f12274f752f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn67@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-09-434_0d1bff779b74c001.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":147238,"destBytes":147238,"author":"Carter Burrowes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Iron-Man-Junji-Ito-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn67@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-09-434_0d1bff779b74c001.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Empyre-5-designs.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-28-328_4214e7ec36cc338b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389172},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"What If...?

The capability to create doors on any given surface, including the air itself, has a wide variety of uses. It could be used for espionage and stealth work or even just teleportation.

After eating it, not only did Chopper acquire a human-level intelligence, but he also gained way more than that. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is criminally overlooked about the Human-Human Fruit is the superintelligence that Chopper received. A human, such as Luffy, has absolutely zero chances of becoming a talented doctor like Chopper.

This Devil Fruit allows its user to transform a part of, or their entire body, into a weapon. If it does exactly what it says it does, then that makes it one of the series' most overwhelming Devil Fruits.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baby 5 was shown to be able to transform into a bomb; therefore, does that mean that with enough knowledge (or imagination) she could transform into a nuclear weapon?</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Chop-Chop Fruit</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mihawk-Buggy-Luffy.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not be misdirected by the comic nature of this fruit and its user. One of the abilities it grants is complete slice damage immunity. It seems apparent that slices from a random ragtag cannon fodder and slices from the World’s Strongest Swordsman all prove futile against its wielder, which protects Buggs from a lot of potential enemies.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buggy D Clown and his Devil Fruit should get the full recognition they very much deserve.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Hobby-Hobby Fruit</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sugar-One-Piece.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If used correctly, there exists no opponent that this Devil Fruit can not topple – Yonkos included. Doflamingo’s entire regime was based on this Hobby-Hobby Fruit; without it, he would’ve had a much harder time expanding his underground influence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, anyone who Sugar makes physical contact with can fall victim to its effects.

However, she proved to be prone to jealousy. She grew extremely jealous of other women in Tony's life, even the ones with whom he had no romantic history. Tony would break up with Kathy only for her to respond by shooting him.</p><p>Tony Starks's death was faked while he recuperated from the gunshot, which left him paralyzed for some time.

After posing as a bystander during a disaster that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/iron-man-most-powerful-armors-not-in-mcu/\">Iron Man</a> would save her from, she began using pheromones to increase his attraction to her. She had been trained to make herself appear as attractive to men as possible.</p><p>Indries would continuously tempt Tony to drink during their relationship.

However, the latter would return and begin dating Rumiko. Rumiko entered the relationship in large part as a rebellion against her parents, who disapproved of Tony. Rumiko enjoyed the relationship with Tony, except for the fact that he was so busy, he hardly paid attention to her.</p><p>They ended the relationship and Rumiko slept with Tony's enemy, Tiberius Stone. She felt remorseful about sleeping with Stone and helped Stark get his company back as a way to make up for it.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Madame Masque</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Madame-Masque-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/madame-masque/\">Madame Masque</a> and Iron Man had quite a complicated relationship.

However, when she returned to Stark Industries under the guise of Krissy Longfellow, they fell for each other again. Unfortunately, her criminal father, Count Nefaria, would return.</p><p>Masque tried to force Tony to save her ill father but he refused and they fought.

Their relationship had a rough patch, as he began drinking heavily as her late husband had. However, unlike her late husband, Tony asked for her help and eventually became sober.</p><p>When Cabe discovered her husband was indeed alive, she left Tony.

They enjoyed being together without being in a serious romantic relationship. What makes this relationship so significant is the parallels between the two and the double standard it forms.</p><p>Tony Stark was a womanizer and player who was famous for sleeping around. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/she-hulk-transformation-facts/\">She-Hulk</a> got around a lot too but she was quicker to be judged for it.

After her marriage with Hank Pym fell apart, the two founding Avengers quickly got together. Captain America tried to get Tony Stark to end the relationship but he didn't.</p><p>Their first affair fell apart after Janet discovered that Tony was Iron Man.

This is in no small part due to Gwyneth Paltrow's portrayal in the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe/\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. What fans of the movies may not know, however, is that things didn't work out for Tony and Pepper in the comics.</p><p>Their romance was limited, as Pepper Potts would end up marrying Happy Hogan.

Pitched as a children's card game but with a depth and complexity that makes even longtime fans pine for a comprehensive guidebook, Duel Monsters has players using monsters, spells and traps to reduce their opponent's life points to zero. If a player is particularly unlucky, this ends with a one-way ticket to the Shadow Realm (in the dub) or the playing of a Penalty Game.</p><p>Despite being billed as a game for kids, Duel Monsters was the ancient Shadow Games made real in modern times, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/yu-gi-oh-card-game-invented-anime/\">at least according to the original series</a>. While the later spinoffs treated the game with varying degrees of seriousness -- from warranting a school focused on the game to being able to duel your way out of getting arrested -- <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/yu-gi-oh-yami-yugi-pharaoh-history-explained/\">the first series established</a> that the monsters themselves were, in reality, the monsters inside all of us, the <em>ka</em> that could be forcibly extracted from criminals (and sometimes innocents) or willingly brought forth by the protagonists. The death of the <em>ka</em> meant the death of the duelist, and these life-and-death stakes continued in the modern setting the characters most frequently found themselves in.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/digimon-adventure-2020-episode-11-leomons-role-reboot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digimon Adventure 2020 Reveals Leomon's Role in the Reboot</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-design-5.png\"/></figure><p>In the anime-exclusive \"Waking the Dragons\" season, Yugi and the Pharaoh learn of the existence of the Duel Spirit Realm, an alternate dimension exclusively populated by the Duel Monsters themselves. Later spinoffs such as <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em> and <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds</em> would continue to make use of this realm, and even make extensive trips (or, in the case of <em>GX</em>'s Bastion Misawa, decide to live there full-time with the Amazoness card of his dreams). This establishes that the Duel Monster cards are indeed alive and sentient, which raises some major ethical questions regarding their use and suggests a sort of creeping horror regarding the daily life of such a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-goh-perfect-time-to-phase-ash-out-of-anime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monster</a>.</p><p>After all, one of the major mechanics of the game is sacrificing weaker monsters to bring out stronger ones -- and this isn't even getting into the concept of fusion summoning, in which two or more monsters are fused to make a new one. Later series are a bit nicer in their depictions of these summons, but early installments were not, showing the monsters disintegrating or exploding. In one memorable instance, having two disparate monsters being force-fusioned resulted in them slowly <em>melting</em> in agony.</p><p>These are living creatures whose entire existence is at the mercy of the duelists, who may or may not treat them with anything regarding care. Take, for example, Seto Kaiba ripping Grandpa Muto's <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/yu-gi-ohs-best-duelists-are-constantly-cheating/\">prize Blue Eyes White Dragon in half</a>, or the sheer callousness with which the Rare Hunters treat their cards. Some are capable of fighting back, such as the Egyptian god monsters, but most must hope that their owner is benevolent, or at the least merciful.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fruits-basket-season-2-episode-20-cinderella-cast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fruits Basket: The Class Casts Its Cinderella Play</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-design-1.png\"/></figure><p>And even before the concept of these monsters being real beings is made manifest in later story arcs, the original series shows this clearly, with the monsters having realistic reactions to the actions taking place on the field--Kuriboh's responses are often played for laughs, but in many cases you can see the monsters in agony upon being hit, and during the Arkana duel in Battle City, Arkana's Dark Magician is horrified at the notion that his master would so callously destroy him for a quick gain. Since they can be summoned back from the graveyard or used in later duels, death is not a release for a suffering Duel Monster.</p><p>The more you consider the concept of Duel Monsters as living things, the more terrifying their very <em>existence</em> becomes. Low-powered monsters must hope for buffs or come to terms with being fodder for traps or <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/digimon-tamers-deserves-the-tri-treatment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">larger monsters</a>. The sight of face down cards elicits fear. Chumley Huffington from the<em> GX</em> series having a heart-to-heart with one of the cards he intends to swap out of his deck is initially played for laughs, but how many cards didn't even get <em>that</em> courtesy?</p><p>But there's a heartwarming aspect when you consider the monsters' relationships with the main characters, especially in <em>GX</em> onward where the Duel Monster spirits directly interact with the characters. These genuine friendships give a different spin to the \"Heart of the Cards.\" The cards themselves want to see their duelists win and are fully capable of responding to their needs. The existence of a Duel Monster is a harsh one, but sometimes it can be rewarding.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/god-of-high-school-episode-6-mujin-nox-mistake-traitor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The God of High School: Mujin’s Enemies Just Made a Costly Mistake</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 04:00:58 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yugioh-1.jpg","linkMd5":"ce6feef5b0c5b109c92912a434fb88eb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-10-511_71015e67aed3b629.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":179880,"destBytes":179880,"author":"Kelsey Dickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yugioh-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-10-511_71015e67aed3b629.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-design-5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn59@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-21-151_1581474aef5da61d.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-design-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-28-243_dcc5154cc1a347d3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389186},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Mortal Kombat: 5 Ways Scorpion Is A Hero (& 5 He's A Villain)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-scorpion-hero-vs-villain-kharon-quan-chi-raiden/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scorpion-good-bad.jpg\"/></figure><p>First debuting in the original <em>Mortal Kombat</em> game, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-scorpion-cosplay/\">Scorpion</a>'s legacy is one of the most contentious of the cast's entire roster. In a world that is often black and white, he is a complex and morally gray character with a long list of actions in service of both good and evil.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-fighters-should-have-lost/\">Mortal Kombat: 10 Heroes Who Should Lose Their Story Fights, But Don't</a></p><p>This divided <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-mortal-kombat-movie-original-vs-scorpions-revenge/\">legacy</a> incurs speculation as to whether or not he has ultimately done more harm than good. To determine this, we explore Scorpion's history, weighing his feats of heroism against those of his depravity. Through this assessment, it is easiest to definitively determine whether or not he is a hero.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Hero - Saving Kharon</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kronika-kharon-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Should Kronika deem one unfit to join their ranks ~ or should they pose a threat to her grand schemes ~ she is inclined to leave them in the tender care of her sadistic servant, D'vorah. The bug queen's ants feasted on Kharon's flesh, hoping to prevent him from ferrying her mistress's enemies.</p><p>However, her taste of victory was short-lived. Scorpion would intervene on his behalf, attacking D'vorah and forcing her to retreat. Without his invaluable aid, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-reasons-johnny-cage-should-be-main-character-instead-of-liu-kang/\">Liu Kang's allies </a>would not have been able to reach their mutually shared opponent.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Villain - Executing Quan Chi</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-kills-quan-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Executing Quan Chi was morally dubious even as an isolated incident. Though he was responsible for manipulating Scorpion and misdirecting his anger toward Sub-Zero, he was also a prisoner of war, one helpless to defend himself.</p><p>More importantly, he was capable of restoring the revenants back to their previous forms. By decapitating him, Hanzo had eliminated the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-jax-cosplay-love/\">Special </a>Forces' best hope of reuniting their friends, a plight which Scorpion himself should be able to relate to.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Hero - Listening To Raiden</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/raiden-scorpion-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Desperate to avoid the current path of history, Raiden approached Scorpion with a simple proposition; spare Sub-Zero's life, and he would ask that his family and clan be restored. Hanzo considered this carefully, finally agreeing to the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-dc-raiden-fight-win-lose/\">Thunder God</a>'s deal.</p><p>While he would later surrender to his passions in an unfortunate fit of rage compelled by the scheming Quan Chi, this nonetheless demonstrated Scorpion's priorities as a character. He values his family and happiness more than he does revenge; if he did not, he never would have agreed to Raiden's offer in the first place.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Villain - Ambushing Johnny Cage</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-movie-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Under the instruction of his dark masters, Scorpion attacked Johnny Cage in the middle of a forest, navigating his spears among the trees in an attempt to skewer him. Eliminating him would remove another obstacle Shang Tsung would have to contend with in his quest to merge Outworld and Earthrealm.</p><p>Unfortunately for Hanzo,<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-johnny-cage-fan-art/\"> Johnny Cage</a> had a plan. Utilizing the terrain to his advantage, he seized the shield of a nearby fallen warrior, using it to block Scorpion's flames and then cleaving through his head. Due to his quick thinking, he was able to avoid a dishonorable assassination.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Hero - Making Peace With Sub-Zero</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-making-peace-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Despite the bitter rivalry between Scorpion and Sub-Zero, they were able to make amends, reconciling their differences at the Lin Kuei Palace. This offering of peace would be interrupted by Frost, who identified Hanzo as an enemy and attempted to exterminate him against her Grandmaster's wishes.</p><p>Nonetheless, the meeting was a success. With the misunderstanding between both ninja cleared up, Scorpion and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-awesome-sub-zero-cosplays/\">Sub-Zero</a> could work together in more productive endeavors, ones which would channel their righteous anger through into more deserving targets. It was a defining moment of character growth for Hanzo, one which demonstrates his abilities of reason.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Villain - Murdering Bi-Han</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bihan-death-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>While Scorpion may have promised otherwise, he would ultimately be as much of a slave to his own rage as he was to Quan Chi. During the tournament in <em>Mortal Kombat 9,</em> he would bring him to the Netherrealm for their battle. After the cryomancer's defeat, his sorcerer master would manifest artificial images of the Shirai Ryu's slaughter to provoke his wrath.</p><p>Bi-Han's provocation immediately before the fight would not help his case. Overcome with grief and anger, Scorpion ripped out his spine, returning to Shang Tsung's palace and presenting it to all those in attendance. This would result in the birth of Noob Saibot, a fierce warrior that would serve the forces of evil in the battles to follow.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Hero - Helping Restore Cyrax</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-cyrax-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Hanzo would come to realize that he was not the only ninja to have his freedom stolen from him. After the peace he struck with Sub-Zero, his new ally requested his assistance in freeing his Lin Kuei friend, Cyrax, from the clutches of Sektor and his Cyber Initiative.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-villains-always-lose-fights/\">Mortal Kombat: 10 Villains That Always Lose Their Fights</a></span></p><p>Despite an unprecedented intervention and attack by Frost, this venture would bear fruit. Hanzo and Sub-Zero would disable Cyrax's behavior inhibitor, returning him to the man he was in<em> Mortal Kombat 9 </em>and giving them an invaluable ally.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Villain - Fighting In The Mortal Kombat Tournament</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-tournament-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Scorpion's involvement in Shang Tsung's tournament was under his benefactor, Quan Chi. Should he succeed in his battles, he would have the privilege of enacting justice on Sub-Zero, however that \"justice\" would manifest.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-complete-franchise-games-ranked/\">Mortal Kombat: Every Game In The Franchise, Ranked</a></span></p><p>The problem with this is that he's still acting in the interest of the Outworld and Netherrealm forces. It entails that if he was victorious, Shang Tsung would be able to merge the realms together. Essentially, Scorpion prioritized a petty victory over the entire planet he was born and raised in.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Hero - Literally Redeeming Himself</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REDEEM-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>When Kronika had brought back warriors from different timelines to do her bidding, Scorpion was among those she returned. This contrasted the Hanzo of the present timeline, giving them an opportunity to face one another.</p><p>Sharing what the future held for his younger self, Hanzo expressed to him the folly of his vengeance, reminding him that his true priorities were in his family. After his death, the Scorpion of the past would take these words to heart, volunteering his services to Raiden and Liu Kang.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Villain - Attacking The Special Forces</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/special-forces-attack-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>To get to Quan Chi, Hanzo would have to contend with the Special Forces. Though he and his warriors offered them an opportunity to stand down, he was exerting his authority over Earthrealm's protectors, an authority that he did not have.</p><p>Since they were understandably unwilling to relinquish him, Scorpion unleashed his wrath on his opponents, beating down many of their allies and weakening their defenses. With D'vorah and the revenants still on the loose, turning on his friends to slake his thirst for revenge was a poor and selfish decision.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-reasons-shao-kahn-best-villain-kronika-better/\">Mortal Kombat: 5 Reasons Shao Kahn Is The Best Villain (&#38; 5 Why It's Kronika)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 14:30:50 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scorpion-good-bad.jpg","linkMd5":"8aee0a27f931ad8e173f9a7fdb87af2c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-09-466_f6ff877a9ca5b08b.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":84610,"destBytes":84610,"author":"David Zimmerman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scorpion-good-bad.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-09-466_f6ff877a9ca5b08b.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kronika-kharon-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn64@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-21-262_2467135633ddfd2a.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-kills-quan-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn8@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-25-793_ff487c7eec09aa30.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/raiden-scorpion-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn15@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-32-618_672e271129c3a9dc.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-movie-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-30-803_c781189a18d56103.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-making-peace-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-24-020_5c8e64dde8af7958.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bihan-death-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-31-881_0b2ea0c42c54110e.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-cyrax-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn64@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-23-855_8496d215b0392131.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scorpion-tournament-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-31-154_aea4a59e9df9d9da.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/REDEEM-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-29-061_e1038eaeacafb32f.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/special-forces-attack-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-22-191_94654f9fe3e7f0d9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389182},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Brooklyn Nine-Nine Star Politely Shreds Canadian Version for Casting Latina Characters With White Actors","link":"https://www.cbr.com/brooklyn-nine-nine-star-canadian-version-latina/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/brooklyn-nine-nine.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/brooklyn-nine-nine/\">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em> star Melissa Fumero has criticized the show's Canadian remake, entitled <em>Escouade 99</em>, for casting white actors as Latina characters.</p><p>\"OMG OMG OMG!!

They're forced to take classes online, unable to truly connect with those around them. Remote classes rob students of connection. Remote classes rob students of school's intrinsically important, non-academic aspects. It's impossible to build relationships, explore new places, have new experiences, and grow as a person when all one does at school is click join on a Zoom link. It's an isolating experience. However, there is a way to fill that void from home: <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/past-persona-games-should-release-next-gen/\">After Persona 5, Past Games in the Series Should Come to Next-Gen</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/P5R1.jpg\"/></figure><p>At its core, <em>Persona 5 Royal</em> is a systemically complex Japanese RPG. On the surface, though, it's an engaging life simulator. The game's protagonist and core characters are part-time Phantom Thieves, yes. But, they're also full-time high school students in modern-day Tokyo, Japan. Considering that <em>Persona 5 Royal</em> works on an in-game calendar system where you play out each day of the characters' lives, attending Shujin Academy is a vital part of gameplay. Yet, while you'll sit through classes answering the occasional question, the crux of the life sim gameplay is the high school experience that surrounds the classroom.</p><p>In terms of the <em>Persona</em> experience, activities like chatting with confidants, attending part-time jobs, and exploring Tokyo are all in service of the game's fantastical elements. In a pre-COVID world, everyday occurrences like hanging out with a friend or working at a convenience store in-game form were decidedly milquetoast in a vacuum. The gameplay thrill came from how partaking in these things allowed for success in the Metaverse – more items, stronger Personas, etc. It's a tantalizing dynamic that makes every aspect of the gameplay loop feel important. This is not a pre-COVID world anymore, though.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/P5R2.jpg\"/></figure><p>While it may seem hyperbolic, the thrill today (to some extent) is inherent to simply existing comfortably in the world. Infiltrating palaces and stealing hearts in Persona's eclectic world continues to be an unforgettable experience. The game's commitment to style and aesthetics makes it one of the loudest, most confidently captivating games on the market. Yet, today, it's hard not to marvel at the most subtle and unintentional things, like a subway train safely filled to standing-room-only without a moment's hesitation.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/how-persona-shin-megami-tensei-are-related/\">How Persona and Shin Megami Tensei Are Related</a></span></p><p>In this sense, <em>Persona 5 Royal</em> is captivating in a fresh way. It allows for a quainter wish-fulfillment: getting to be back in a world that doesn't feel so foreign. Simply strolling around the subway station or exploring the streets of Shibuya is uniquely engaging. While you're able to pass directly through all of Japan's bustling inhabitants (perhaps a vestigial limitation from the game's PS3 roots), this world still feels so alive. It's crawling with people to talk with and things to do.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/P5R3.jpg\"/></figure><p>It offers the perfect framework for those real-world students studying remotely. The morning trip from Café Leblanc to Shujin Academy offers the adventure which is lost by simply rolling out of bed and hopping into an online class apparatus. The school grounds provide the camaraderie that's lost when sequestered at home. The hours after class offer a sense of unrestrained autonomy. Perhaps you'll head into the city with Ryuji or stop into a café with Ann. Maybe you'll head back to Sojiro's and brew some coffee for the customers. Or, you'll head to a part-time job, earn some yen, and go shopping. Such choices only begin to scratch the surface of the game's social content.</p><p>No game will be able to replace the feeling of actually getting out into the world and learning about yourself. It's a vital part of life. However, it just isn't in the cards for everyone right now. As such, we have to turn to the escapist power of video games to find some avenue to express our longing. There is no better outlet than <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>. With its impeccable writing, robust social systems, and overall polish, getting lost in Tokyo is as magical as ever. These days though, that magic is augmented by our real-world conditions. <em>Persona 5 Royal</em> truly is the game that students need right now.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/next-persona-game-should-be-persona-6/\">The Next Persona Game Should Be Persona 6, Not Another Persona 5 Sequel</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:15:50 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/persona-5-royal.jpg","linkMd5":"5df70a90060f0651531819cfb805249a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn59@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-11-293_3fdc317003bb4c45.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":114426,"destBytes":114426,"author":"Abram Buehner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/persona-5-royal.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn59@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-11-293_3fdc317003bb4c45.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/P5R1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-30-043_0165abf8766367a7.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/P5R2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-22-456_605199449e0f0060.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/P5R3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn43@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-22-128_c200dc30fde039e0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389184},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"Dragon Ball Z: 5 Villains Android 18 Could Defeat (& 5 She'd Lose To)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-android-18-characters-can-cant-beat/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21-18-Freiza-Fight.jpg\"/></figure><p>Introduced in arguably the most famous Dragon Ball Z storyline, The Andriod/Cell Saga, Andriod 18 quickly became a fan favorite after establishing herself as one of the most powerful villains and fighters the Z-Fighters had ever seen. Originally as one of the only female warriors in the series, 18 was a powerhouse capable of taking on <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Piccolo/\">Piccolo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Trunks/\">Mirai Trunks</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Vegeta/\">Vegeta</a>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-worst-things-android-18-did/\">Dragon Ball: The 10 Worst Things Andriod 18 Ever Did, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Following <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Cell/\">Cell's</a> defeat, 18<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-villains-changed-stayed-bad/\"> turned over a new leaf</a> and allied herself with the Z-Fighters. Though she preferred to stay on the sidelines in subsequent stories (for some reason), 18's pure power never dwindled,  helping <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Goku/\">Goku</a> win one of his final fights in the series. With an unlimited power supply, 18 could easily trounce several of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-movie-villains-should-be-canon-stay-out/\">DBZ's villains</a>... but she'd still lose out to some.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Could Beat: Captain Ginyu</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dragon-Ball-S-Captain-Ginyu.jpg' /></figure><p>Though Ginyu does have his famous \"Body Swap\" technique, he usually saves it as a last resort.

Most notably, his spit was able to turn people into stone for him to shatter, such as Piccolo. However, unlike the Namekian, 18 did not possess the ability to self to regenerate, making a fight between her and Dabura more fatal.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Could Beat: Andriod 13</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Android-13-1-1-2.jpg' /></figure><p>Though Dr. Gero created both of them, 18 &#38; 13 never meet. 13 was part of Gero's backup plan should 18 and her brother Andriod 17 ever grow hostile, which they did. 13 is programmed by Gero's supercomputer and sent to finish the doctor's revenge on Goku.

Goku Black retained all of Zamasu's original abilities and intelligence as well as Goku's Saiyan biology and raw power. As a result, he was powerful enough to overwhelm the likes of Vegeta, Trunks, and the original Goku.</p><p>Though 18 is undoubtedly capable of besting Super Saiyans, she would not be powerful enough to overcome a Saiyan's might that's been augmented by the god power of a Kai.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Could Beat: Cooler</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cooler-1-1-1.jpg' /></figure><p>As Frieza's older brother, Cooler was every bit as strong as him and then some. Aside from having four transformations instead of three, Cooler appears to be more adept at tactical planning. He was able to hide his ki to avoid detection, something Freiza never could do. He's also able to gather energy for attacks much faster. Still, 18 would be able to defeat him swiftly, granted she doesn't toy with him.</p><p>Even with his new \"Golden Cooler\" form, 18 has enough speed to dodge his attacks and wait for him to exhaust himself. Afterward, she'd still be able to go in for the kill.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Would Lose To: Janemba</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Janemba-1-1.jpg' /></figure><p>His powers were so vast that it took the fusion Gogeta to defeat him, making him one of the most powerful <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-super-villainchinese-zodiac/\">villains in DBZ</a>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Could Beat: Zangya</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zangya.jpg' /></figure><p>Like her fellow Galaxy Soldiers, Zangya was such a threat to the universe that King Kai had to seal her inside a star. Following his death, Zangya and her companions make their way to Earth after sensing the energy created by The Cell Games. She's able to battle and win against Piccolo, Trunks, and Tien, making her a dangerous threat. With many video games implementing unique dialogue between the women about their mutual attraction to 18's husband, Krillin, a real fight between the two has always piqued fan interest.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-characters-most-least-resurrections/\">Dragon Ball: The Characters With The Most Resurrections, Ranked From Least To Most</a></span></p><p>Zangya was unable to utilize her race's ability to transform, which would have increased her power by a large margin. As a result, 18 would be more than a challenge for her. Though Zangya was demonstrated to be able to outmatch a Super Saiyan, she often was aided by the other members of her gang.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Would Lose To: Baby</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dragon-Ball-GT-Baby.jpg' /></figure><p>By the time Baby surfaced as a threat, 18 had mostly given up on her fighting days... for some reason. It's worth noting that due to her primarily organic nature, 18 could have continued to grow stronger throughout the series and remain a prominent threat (she just wasn't written that way). Regardless, 18 would have struggled immensely with fighting Baby, a parasite based life form.</p><p>Though she is shown being controlled by the parasite in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Dragon-Ball-GT/\"><em>Dragon Ball GT</em></a>, it's not shown whether or not she faced him in battle. Still, the result is pretty clear. Baby can gain all powers of a host he infects, which, combined with his already great innate power, would have largely outclassed 18.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-towa-characters-defeat/\">Dragon Ball: 5 Characters Towa Can Defeat (&#38; 5 She Can't)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:30:02 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21-18-Freiza-Fight.jpg","linkMd5":"ca7f3ac2a7f329bb2353d8f6f7180df0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-09-367_810ac8c0cf81a77e.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":640,"sourceBytes":78136,"destBytes":78136,"author":"Brian Sheridan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21-18-Freiza-Fight.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-09-367_810ac8c0cf81a77e.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dragon-Ball-S-Captain-Ginyu.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-27-609_15291977c7a4f413.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/android-21.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-43-23-302_f3ad77740140589c.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/friezaghost-ptess-112757.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-29-497_21cfe9f3398f41ba.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dabura.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-24-118_c45d81481ef28f00.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Android-13-1-1-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-22-483_f7146e5065f1571c.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/j5KerC-Cropped.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-27-641_f3f33e123d1d1e80.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cooler-1-1-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-25-698_1352e590e35bb144.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Janemba-1-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-27-101_b3be948e9b6d0a7b.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zangya.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-31-757_99580edb1dfa2db9.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dragon-Ball-GT-Baby.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn56@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-23-615_667dc7da72746ed7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389174},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"The Batman Trailer Brings One of His Most Iconic Lines to the Big Screen","link":"https://www.cbr.com/the-batman-teaser-trailer-iconic-line-vengeance/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/batman-trailer-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p>During DC FanDome, Warner Bros. released <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-teaser-trailer-dc-fandome/\">the first teaser trailer</a> for Matt Reeves' upcoming film <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-batman/\">The Batman</a>.

When one of them asks who he's supposed to be, Batman performs one of the greatest live action beat-downs, dealing out both pain and justice with his fists.

In the episode, Batman first went up against the Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. After getting dosed with the villain's Fear Toxin, Bruce began to experience hallucinations of his father, who called him out for being a disgrace.

And once he figures that he's actually Rudy Jones, whom he had met earlier, and he's this human, there's a little different take on what even Clark thinks is an outsider,\" Palmer explained. \"There's Lobo and Martian Manhunter, who are aliens to Earth, we have Parasite, who is an actual Earthling being treated like an outsider, even though he's from here, as he's changing. It just felt like another side of the coin for what like an outsider feels.\"</p><p>Directed by Chris Palmer, <em>Superman: Man of Tomorrow</em> stars Darren Criss as Clark Kent/Superman, Zachary Quinto as Lex Luthor, Alexandra Daddario as Lois Lane, Ryan Hurst as Lobo, Brett Dalton as Rudy Jones/Parasite, Ike Aamadi as Martian Manhunter, Neil Flynn as Jonathan Kent and Bellamy Young as Martha Kent.

While details regarding the project were sparse, it was implied that the film would be <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-woman-film/\">Spider-Woman</a>, bringing Jessica Drew to the big screen.</p><p>The Sony world of Marvel movies has seemingly redubbed itself the Venomverse. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-man-film/\">Spider-Man</a> is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/venom-film/\">Venom</a> was the next top name in the Sony catalog. However, there might be a better person to lead this shared universe of Marvel films. With the news of the <em>Spider-Woman</em> movie, Sony might have found the perfect character to spearhead Sony's ever-growing franchise.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Olivia Wilde Should Also STAR in Spider-Woman as Jessica Drew\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/olivia-wilde-should-star-spider-woman-jessica-drew/\">Olivia Wilde Should Also STAR In Spider-Woman As Jessica Drew</a></span></p><p>In the best-case scenario, Sony and the MCU could work hand-in-hand with the universe, sharing Peter Parker, but that isn't going to happen. Considering how Sony almost cost the MCU Spider-Man last year, it is time for each studio to find its way to use the characters. Spider-Woman would have been a perfect fit in the MCU, with her connections to Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. However, that ship has sailed, but that does not mean all is lost for Jessica Drew.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/spider-woman-jessica-drew.jpg\"/></figure><p>It is time for Sony to see the value it has in <em>Spider-Woman</em>, as this movie could be unlike anything Marvel or DC has put out to date. It took a long time for the studios to trust a female-led superhero movie after the disappointing <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/elektra/\"><em>Elektra</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/catwoman-film/\"><em>Catwoman</em></a>. However, once Warner Bros. pulled the trigger with <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/wonder-woman-film/\"><em>Wonder Woman</em></a>, that film ended up a massive success. Add in both <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-marvel-film/\"><em>Captain Marvel</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/birds-of-prey-film/\"><em>Birds of Prey</em></a>, and it is clear that fans are ready for smart, entertaining female-led superhero movies. With <em>Spider-Woman</em>, Sony could go one step further. They could use a female superhero to lead the entire franchise. Jessica Drew could be Sony's version of Tony Stark.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Olivia Wilde to Direct Sony Marvel Film, Rumored to Be Spider-Woman\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/olivia-wilde-direct-sony-marvel-film-spider-woman/\">Olivia Wilde To Direct Sony Marvel Film, Rumored To Be Spider-Woman</a></span></p><p>The best news is that Sony can play around with her origin story thanks to one of Jessica Drew's key traits from the comic books. Drew doesn't even know her exact history due to the manipulation of her mind as a young woman. An excellent example of what a Spider-Woman movie could look like came with the Netflix series <em>Jessica Jones</em>, who ironically is one of Drew's close friends in the comics. Much like Jones, Spider-Woman is also a private investigator, and that could lead to a great introductory storyline. Drew operates on the West Coast, the same as Venom, so she is in a perfect location to play in the universe Sony already created.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/spider-woman-skrull-display.jpg\"/></figure><p>To fit in the character of Jessica Drew, Sony has to ignore Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. and go full-on with an origin in the Wundagore Mountain storyline. Her parents were geneticists who accidentally gave their baby superpowers before she is even born. The film could use Wundagore, or better yet, throw Jessica right into the action in San Francisco as a private investigator, hinting at her origin as the <em>Venom</em> movie did for Eddie Brock. Speaking of Brock, using Jessica as a private investigator in California could give her a perfect chance to meet Brock, someone else seeking to expose the truth, if Sony wants its first big crossover.</p><p>The success of a <em>Spider-Woman</em> series could lead to Jessica Drew becoming the poster child for Sony's Marvel world. The film could also open the door for other projects Sony passed on in recent years. Sony had the plans to make a movie called <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/silver-and-black/\"><em>Silver &#38; Black</em></a>, which was supposed to bring in Black Cat and Silver Sable. Both of these characters could show up in Spider-Woman films, and it makes more sense for them to connect with Drew than with Venom.</p><p>If Sony needs a new star for its Marvel Universe, it may have found it in Spider-Woman.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Spider-Woman's Secret Origin Is Revealed in Giant-Sized 100th Issue\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-woman-secret-origin-giant-sized-100th-issue/\">Spider-Woman's Secret Origin Is Revealed In Giant-Sized 100th Issue</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 09:45:09 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/spider-woman-header.jpg","linkMd5":"59c0438a09bdbfeae2a513699e4e6bc8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-09-465_2cb801b2d1ee6f1d.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":177002,"destBytes":177002,"author":"Shawn S.

There's also plenty of wire work, which allows her to perform amazing stunts. The inventive choreography also adds Carol's signature photon blasts to create some truly epic moments.

Nevertheless, there are fans who were disappointed because it didn't create a particular spark for Carol Danvers. After all, the hero is supposed to be the next leader of Earth's Mightiest Heroes following the events of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/\">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, but some argue her theatrical debut didn't provide enough substance for Captain Marvel to stand out in a major, character-defining way.</p><p>In that regard, the film could be compared to <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-america-the-first-avenger/\">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></em>, which drew similar complaints about Steve Rogers. However, those doubts were all but put to rest with the release of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-america-the-winter-soldier/\">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em>, which massively changed the character. In the sequel, Captain America adopted a new fighting style that cemented him as a powerhouse, and that, coupled with strong characterization, made Steve Rogers a fan favorite who would go on to rival Tony Stark as the most popular Avenger.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG-2115.jpg\"/></figure><p>And now, Bennet's stunt video showcasing what Captain Marvel <em>could</em> have delivered in her cinematic debut reveals the action scenes that might have rivaled those in <em>The Winter Soldier</em>. The video demonstrates why Carol Danvers is a force to be reckoned with -- not only because of raw power, but because of her skills. The footage gives Carol a defined fighting style, which perfectly complements her military background.</p><p>A character isn't defined simply by action scenes, of course, but they certainly help. It's par for the course in Marvel's films, after all, which have given us some fan-favorite fights, such as Captain America's assault on the Lemurian Star or Thor's lightning-fueled attack on Hela's forces on the Bifrost.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/captain-marvel-original-script-killed-talos/\">Captain Marvel's Original Script Killed Off a Major Hero</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/captain-marvel-power.jpg\"/></figure><p>Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the dynamic fight scenes by Bennett and  <em>Captain Marvel</em>'s stunt team didn't make it into the final product. That's a shame, considering the fight sequences in <em>Captain Marvel</em> are mostly forgettable (save for when Carol goes Super Saiyan on a fleet of Kree ships).</p><p>Who knows, if <em>Captain Marvel</em> did include these concept fight scenes, perhaps fans would love the character even more, and there would be even more excitement for her leading a new incarnation of the Avengers. Hopefully, <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-marvel-2/\">Captain Marvel 2</a></em> will accomplish what <em>The Winter Soldier</em> did for Captain America by allowing the character to shine even more -- not only because of her powers, but because of who she is.</p><p><em>Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, </em>Captain Marvel<em> stars Brie Larson, Samuel L.

This particular scene, of course, is from Snyder's Knightmare sequence, which was a glimpse of the future where Darkseid won and the forces of Apokolips overran Earth.

That said, Batman could be carrying the card as a motivator to stop the next threat, in this case the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/15-darkest-versions-of-superman/\">corrupted Superman</a>.</p><p>As for the card's origin, it's not clear if the one shown in the trailer is the same one Bruce keeps as a memento or if it's just a piece of debris.

Especially considering the atrocious actions done by the entirety of the crew, it wouldn’t be surprising if Burgess had a bounty of 800,000,000 berries. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Laffitte (At Least 42,000,000)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Laffite-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laffitte is also one of the OG members who has been with Blackbeard since the formation of the crew. Unlike the brute Jesus Burgess, Laffitte seems to be rather refined – perhaps even a bit too refined for a pirate. And like all the other original members, he is extremely loyal to Blackbeard; loyal enough to threaten <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-strongest-characters-impel-down-arc/\">Avalo Pizarro</a>, a fellow Titanic Captain, due to him jokingly downplaying Blackbeard.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the captain of the 5th ship of the Blackbeard Pirates and a certified Yonko commander, it’s pretty much certain that Laffitte would possess above-average combat prowess. Armament and observational Haki are, of course, a given as well. Moreso, a bounty of 42,000,000 berries is way too unproportionate to his true capabilities. Anything above 500,000,000 berries wouldn’t be out of the question. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Van Augur (At Least 64,000,000 Berries)</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Van-augur-one-piece.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Van Augur is the Blackbeard Crew’s sniper, as well as the captain of the 3rd ship. His capabilities as a sniper are the real deal, with even the likes of Usopp finding some of Van Augur's shots to be impossible to pull. Just like the aforementioned two members, Van Augur also was a core member of the early crew. Thus, his loyalty to Blackbeard can not be doubted.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-usopp-characters-defeat-lose/\">One Piece: 5 Characters Usopp Can Beat (&#38; 5 He Can't)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the information available, the Yonko commander with the least bounty was Charlotte Snack. He had a bounty of 500,000,000 berries prior to his defeat at the hands of Urouge. With that in mind, it can be safely assumed that Van Augor has a bounty similar to, if not more than, Snack’s bounty. After all, Van Augor’s history with the World Government most certainly goes deeper than that of Snack’s.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Doc Q (At Least 72,000,000 Berries)</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Q-one-piece.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of all the original members of the Blackbeard Crew, Doc ”Death God” Q is the one <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mysteries-resolved-unanswered/\">shrouded in the most mystery</a>. According to him, he has a chronic illness that robs him off most of his energy, rendering him unable to walk for long distances on his own.

With only a single hand, he swung at and successfully wounded Whitebeard with a scythe; now, in all fairness, the latter was already in rough shape. Prior to the timeskip, Doc Q had a bounty of 72,000,000 berries, which has likely inflated to multiple times that amount by now. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Blackbeard (2,247,600,000 Berries)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gATcjbrW.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but definitely not least, there is <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-pirates-more-than-one-crew/\">Marshall D. Teach, a.k.a Blackbeard</a>. He is the newest emperor of the sea and one of the series’ evilest men, even by pirate standards. What’s so impressive about Teach isn’t the men he commands or <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-yonko-vs-world-government-protection/\">territory he controls</a>, it’s the inhumane amount of resilience and deep level of scheming he has shown that separates him from other villains. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For decades, Blackbeard nurtured his ambitions and hid under Whitebeard’s magnificent shadow. He made sure to attract no attention until the time was right. And boy oh boy! He certainly attracted a massive amount of attention when the time was right. He struck ever-so-aggressively and took the entire world by storm. Blackbeard's bounty stands at a staggering amount of 2,247,600,000 berries, a number very much befitting a man of his caliber. </span></p><p><span class=\"next-single\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-blackbeard-facts-know-anime/\">One Piece: 10 Facts You Didn't Know About Blackbeard</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:30:48 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/One-Piece-The-Known-Bounty-Of-Every-Blackbeard-Pirate-Ranked-From-Lowest-To-Highest-featured-image-2.jpg","linkMd5":"457240d4574a7799bc928a3329fd9202","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-11-523_7c4d4bf9c908cc9b.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":103868,"destBytes":103868,"author":"Suliman Omar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/One-Piece-The-Known-Bounty-Of-Every-Blackbeard-Pirate-Ranked-From-Lowest-To-Highest-featured-image-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-11-523_7c4d4bf9c908cc9b.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jesus-Burgess-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn84@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-28-153_026855edb5018a29.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Laffite-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-29-577_cf6fe6b7bfe7704d.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Van-augur-one-piece.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-32-510_435cdc6a5d2918f9.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doc-Q-one-piece.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-21-092_ab6a1606403c746e.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gATcjbrW.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-22-282_2b3c807f39c385d9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389173},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","title":"The Flash: How Wally West Met Kid Flash for the First Time | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-wally-wallace-west-meeting/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Flash-Wally-West-Wallace-West.jpg\"/></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash\">Flash</a> Family has undergone some significant changes over the last decade. The arrival of the New 52 changed things up for the entire DC Universe, but it shattered the world of the Flash more than any other hero.</p><p>This is because the New 52 eliminated the existence of one of the most enduring members of the Flash universe, Wally West, who had grown from Kid Flash into a generation's defining speedster. When DC Rebirth began years later, Wally West eventually returned to the DC Universe, but he wasn't the only Wally West in town anymore, since a young new Kid Flash was running around with that name and identity. After Wally started to get reacclimated in the universe, it was time for Wally West to meet the new Kid Flash, Wallace West.</p><p>Wallace West made his first appearance in Van Jensen, Robert Venditti, Brett Booth and Ron Frenz's <em>The Flash Annual</em> #3 in 2014, where he debuted in an alley spray-painting a circle with a slash through the Flash symbol. Barry Allen stopped him and had him arrested before realizing Wally was the nephew of Iris West, her nephew who she took in to keep out of foster care after the Crime Syndicate attacked. When Wally gained his powers, Flash tried to be a positive role model for him. Much like the original Wally West, the Flash was very much there to help him.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"The Flash Finds the Ultimate Super-Speed Challenge\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/flash-lightning-cup-race/\">The Flash Finds The Ultimate Super-Speed Challenge</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wally-West-Wallace-West.jpg\"/></figure><p>In Joshua Williamson and Jorge Corona's <em>The Flash</em> #9, Wallace and Wally finally met. By this time, Wallace was Kid Flash, and he was working as the Flash's sidekick, although he still didn't know that Flash was Barry Allen yet. The two were working on rebuilding a bridge to save people when suddenly, out of nowhere, the original Wally West showed up and helped. Barry let Kid Flash know that this was a friend, and he was also known as the Flash.</p><p>Wally West set up the meeting as he was trying to figure out his place in the world that had changed drastically from before he was wiped from existence. However, when Wally shook Flash's hand, something happened, and Barry ended up zapped by something that caused him to start to lose himself in the Speed Force. He began to lose his grip and start verbally attacking the two, even going as far as to tell Kid Flash that his father was Daniel West, the Reverse-Flash. The two Wally's teamed up and used their love of Barry to pull him out and save him.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"The Flash: Reverse-Flash Has ANOTHER Connection to Rebirth\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-757-reverse-flash-second-rebirth-connection/\">The Flash: Reverse-Flash Has ANOTHER Connection To Rebirth</a></span></p><p>Wally was there for two reasons. He wanted to talk to Kid Flash, give him a little advice about believing in himself, and not letting the fact his dad was Reverse-Flash define him. He wanted to be there for him the same way Barry was there for him in the past. He wanted to let him know they were family. In reality, they were cousins, with Wally's father Rudy and Kid Flash's dad Daniel being brothers. His other reason was to check in with Barry about what was happening with the Speed Force.</p><p>The two Wallys became like family, as many of DC's speedsters are. Wallace ended up on the Teen Titans, and Wally ended up back with his original teammates, the adult Titans. By this time, the Titans and Superman knew who Wally was and remembered him, joining Barry Allen in his efforts to find his place in the universe. However, things got dark for Wally West. He developed a heart condition and ended up dying from a heart attack in a battle with H.I.V.E. Luckily, Wallace saved him, healing his heart condition in the process. Since then, these two Flashes have both run alongside each other many times as parts of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-kid-flash-impulse-meeting/\">ever-growing Flash</a> Family.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"The Reverse-Flash Stole a Move From The Flash TV Show\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-756-reverse-flash-mentors-tornado-twins-tv-show-comparison/\">The Reverse-Flash Stole A Move From The Flash TV Show</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:20:36 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Flash-Wally-West-Wallace-West.jpg","linkMd5":"177ef665f6d513f183c5d84b22619bf2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn63@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-11-328_68e1446e1eb576c8.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":219624,"destBytes":219624,"author":"Shawn S.

The second season of <em>The Boys </em>is set to release on Sept. 4, and the show's sophomore outing does a lot right by finding compelling ways to advance the world and its characters.</p><p><em>The Boys </em>Season 2 picks up after <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/boys-season-2-homelander-photo-blood-cuddles/\">Billy Butcher</a> (Karl Urban) fails to kill Homelander (Antony Starr) at the home of Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue). While Billy survives his encounter with Homelander, he's also learns that Becca (Shantel VanSanten) -- his wife whom he thought was dead -- is still alive, which drives pretty much everything he does in Season 2. Meanwhile, the rest of his team focuses on taking down Vought International. However, making things more complex is that The Boys are now wanted as a result of the deaths of Translucent (Alex Hassell) and Stillwell. Despite that impediment, the team becomes increasingly embroiled in a political conspiracy surrounding Compound V -- which is how Supes get their powers --  while contending with the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-stormfront-social-media-age/\">social-media savvy superhero Stormfront</a> (Aya Cash) and an increasingly unhinged Homelander.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-when-season-3-plans-to-film/\">The Boys Showrunner Reveals When Season 3 Plans to Start Filming</a></span></p><p><em>The Boys</em> Season 2 introduces a big status quo change for the team by having them exposed and in the open rather than operating in the shadows. This leads to a lot of tension, as they are at every turn in an incredible amount of danger, though this is somewhat undercut by the fact people don't seem to notice with any consistency that they're in the presence of the most wanted people in the United States. Still, there's a lot of fantastic intrigue in <em>The Boys Season 2</em>, with its best moments made possible by the internal strife and shifting alliances generated from the various twists of Season 1 as well as the dark history of Vought International and the cabalistic ambitions of CEO Stan Edgar (Giancarlo Esposito).</p><p>While <em>The Boys </em>Season 2 certainly has its fill of action, the slow, thoughtful moments are really where the series excels. <em>The Boys </em>isn't afraid to challenge its characters -- or relationships like the one between Kimiko/The Female (Karen Fukuhara) and Frenchie (Tomer Capon) -- to grow, and it's all the better for that choice. At some point in the Season 2, every main character -- and many of the side characters -- are challenged by a difficult revelation, their history and/or their desires, making everyone feel more fleshed out and alive than ever. Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) in particular grows a lot in Season 2, which causes some tension between him and Billy, who himself undergoes a pretty major character arc this time around.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-showrunner-five-seasons-series/\">The Boys Showrunner Thinks Five Seasons Is a Good Run for the Series</a></span></p><p>Of course, those challenges wouldn't matter without the acting, which remains top-notch throughout <em>The Boys </em>Season 2. In terms of the returning cast, Antony Starr's Homelander is worth singling out. Starr is absolutely magnetic in each and every scene that he appears, carrying a sort of dread-inspiring gravitas that makes him feel entirely unpredictable and dangerous. As for the new additions, Aya Cash is solid and charismatic as Stormfront, but she's no match for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/boys-season-2-shawn-ashmore-lamplighter/\">Shawn Ashmore's Lamplighter</a>, who burns brightly as he challenges everyone with whom he comes into contact.</p><p>A major part of <em>The Boys </em>Season 1's appeal -- and of the comic, too -- was its deconstruction of superhero culture, which worked especially well considering the popularity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Extended Universe. While that exploration still plays a role in Season 2, the focus is much more on politics, particularly contemporary alt-right and Neo-Nazi discourse. However, the net here gets cast rather wide, and <em>The Boys</em> doesn't always have time to address those issues in the depth that they deserve. Admittedly, though, the set-up for Season 3 does tease a deeper exploration of some of the political angles that don't quite get done justice in Season 2. Plus, <em>The Boys </em>anti-fascist message is quite clear and, at times, rather nuanced, which is really the show's main focus this time around.</p><p>If there's any real downside to <em>The Boys </em>Season 2, it's that the show's trademark crassness and gore actually sometimes get in its way. While there are a number of scenes -- especially emotional ones -- that get enhanced by these two elements, the show will sometimes use them more for shock value than actual substance. This was a bit of a problem in Season 1, but it's more pronounced in Season 2. One scene later on in the season (and so not discussable here for spoiler reasons) uses a kind of mix of humor and gore to undercut a pretty major emotional moment that just occured, which disappointingly robs several characters of a good, interesting moment. For the most part, the best episodes of Season 2 don't actually use crasness and gore more than absolutely necessary, instead saving them for key, impactful moments.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/boys-season-2-homelander-photo-blood-cuddles/\">The Boys Star Teases Blood (and Cuddles) in Season 2 With an Ominous Homelander Photo</a></span></p><p>While so often a popular show's sophomore outing can fail to live up to the hype, The<em> Boys </em>Season 2 is a triumphant return that pushes the Amazon Prime Video series in bold new directions by challenging its characters in big ways. There are still some issues and growing pains, but overall <em>The Boys</em>' sophomore outing is a great season of television.</p><p><em>Amazon Studios' <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-boys-season-2-3-comic-stories/amp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Boys</a> stars Karl Urban as Billy Butcher, Jack Quaid as Hughie, Laz Alonso as Mother's Milk, Tomer Kapon as Frenchie, Karen Fukuhara as the Female, Erin Moriarty as Annie January, Chace Crawford as the Deep, Antony Starr as Homelander, Aya Cash as Stormfront and Simon Pegg as Hughie's dad.

Captain Kirk famously beat the Kobayashi Maru scenario by cheating because he never believed in the idea of a no-win scenario.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-best-worst-ship-designs/\">Star Trek: 5 Best Ship Designs (&#38; 5 Worst Ship Designs)</a></span></p><p>Captain Picard, meanwhile, learned the true meaning of the Kobayashi Maru scenario: sometimes you can not win, but how you handle yourself in defeat is just as important. Picard, if nothing else, always met every scenario with grace and courage.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>\"There Can Be No Justice So Long As Laws Are Absolute.\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Picard-Beverly-Crusher-and-Data.jpg' /></figure><p>Every society needs laws. Laws lay out the blueprints for a just society and without them, there is nothing that will hold a society together. But laws cannot be considered absolute, because morality exists in a grey area. A law that does account for the circumstances that led to the breaking of the law is not upholding justice, but creating injustice.</p><p>This is an issue humanity has long worked to understand and by the time Captain Picard is flying into the final frontiers, we have learned how to balance laws and justice. As part of his mission for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-best-starfleet-uniforms-ranked/\">Starfleet</a>, Picard looks to share that knowledge with other civilizations.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>\"There Are Four Lights\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-There-Are-Four-Lights.jpg' /></figure><p>The idea is simple: show a person four lights, and tell them that if they say there are five they will no longer be tortured. The goal is to break that person's will, to make them bend to the torturer's whim, thus giving the torturer full control. When Jean-Luc Picard was taken captive and tortured by the Cardassians, they used this method against him. Picard would not break.</p><p>No matter how much they hurt him, the Captain would always defiantly respond with \"There are four lights.\" This is the power that the mind of a strong-willed person has. No matter what is done to them, they will not give in.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>\"Things Are Only Impossible Until They're Not.\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Captain-Picard-Day.jpg' /></figure><p>History is made by the impossible being conquered. From the first person creating fire to mankind breaking free from the chains of gravity and launching into the skies and placing a foot on the moon, things that once seemed like a fool's dreams have time and again become milestones that have been met and surpassed.</p><p>For Captain Picard, traveling at speeds faster than light and using teleportation devices to hang out on previously undiscovered countries makes all of the impossible things seem far more possible. As with all of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-trek/\">Star Trek</a></em>, the joy is in believing that the impossible will, one day, be very possible.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>\"There Was A Time You Looked At The Stars And Dreamed Of What Might Be.\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Picard-and-Shinzon.jpg' /></figure><p>Jean-Luc Picard, like so many heroes before him, understands the importance of dreams. He knows that the person who strives to be more and create more than what exists now is who makes the universe a better place. With each dream realized, new dreams come into being, helping everyone reach greater heights. But as we dream of bigger and better things, we must remember where we started and appreciate how far we have come.</p><p>In this instance, Picard was speaking to his evil clone Shinzon who had lived a life of pain, but the idea stands for us all. We all dream of a better world and our place in it.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>\"If We're Going To Be Damned, Let's Be Damned For What We Really Are.\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-the-Next-Generation-Encounter-at-Farpoint-Picard-and-Q.jpg' /></figure><p>Above all else, Jean-Luc Picard believed it was imperative that a person lives up to their personal beliefs. This doesn't mean a person needs to be perfect, quite the opposite. What it means is that a person needs to stand up for what they believe in and be ready to deal with the consequences.</p><p>This quote comes from the very first episode of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. As the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-top-q-episodes-imdb/\">omnipotent being Q</a> watches the crew of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-secrets-of-the-enterprise-that-only-real-trek-fans-know/\">Enterprise</a> so he can judge all of the human race, Picard makes it clear to his crew what he expects: for them to be true to themselves and the ideology of mankind.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>\"There Are Times, Sir, When Men Of Good Conscience Cannot Blindly Follow Orders.\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-the-Next-Generation-Offspring.jpg' /></figure><p>Sometimes, <em>Star Trek</em> explores the differences between following orders and doing what is right. Rules can be unjust or cruel, and it is up to each person to decide for themselves what they are willing, or unwilling, to do. For Picard, his beliefs are clear.</p><p>He will never intentionally harm a living being if it can be avoided, even if that means going against orders from his higher-ups. There is bravery in refusing to carry out unjust orders. It is a bravery that Picard and the crew of the Enterprise exhibited on more than one occasion.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>\"Villains Who Twirl Their Mustache Are Easy To Spot.

They do clearly evil things in clearly evil ways. In reality, a lot of bad people are great at hiding their true colors behind a façade of kindness and charity.

The episodes usually focus on smart people facing difficult problems and coming up with smart answers. No franchise has led more people to become scientists, engineers, or doctors more than <em>Star Trek.</em></p><p>But at its heart,<em> Star Trek</em> is about what makes life worth living and what it means to create a legacy. Stories about good people doing good will inspire future generations. Art, music, and literature are as much a part of what makes mankind great as the science we have discovered. To Picard, you can not have one without the other.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-vs-star-trek-better-franchise/\">5 Reasons Star Wars is the Best (&#38; 5 Reasons Star Trek is the Best)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 14:30:12 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Captain-Picard-and-the-Enterprise.jpg","linkMd5":"d3edf5f5e464851b6622d3f8198b3b23","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn63@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-09-461_c7338bfd08190092.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":79866,"destBytes":79866,"author":"Derek Faraci","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Captain-Picard-and-the-Enterprise.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn63@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-43-09-461_c7338bfd08190092.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Picard-Playing-The-Flute.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn51@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-32-095_2a72d41077a6adb3.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Peak-Performance.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-25-003_7d8f6843f8be01c9.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Picard-Beverly-Crusher-and-Data.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-22-451_21eda24ca7f0c906.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-There-Are-Four-Lights.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-43-21-234_35f86ff3486a072d.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Captain-Picard-Day.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-28-925_0f0d44cc6f2e51d3.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Picard-and-Shinzon.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn7@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-22-192_75810238f01a4342.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-the-Next-Generation-Encounter-at-Farpoint-Picard-and-Q.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-27-904_eeaf0509af0edb56.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-the-Next-Generation-Offspring.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-43-22-614_d3fa8c866e74844a.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-The-Drumhead.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn27@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-43-31-048_e8bdba0beef0e082.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Picard-and-Wesley-Crusher.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-26-692_35fe68ce3d69f488.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305389183}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:43:09","feedId":3746,"fetchDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 21:43:09 +0000","fetchMs":417,"handleMs":1706,"totalMs":29623,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":100,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"34.206.228.248","hostName":"us-53.herokuapp.com","requestId":"87b5c5714dfc4cbd8f4cded11c4c474a_3746","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":76996820,"bgimgsTotal":100,"bgimgsGithubTotal":100,"articlesImgsTotal":472,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":472,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":17,"myreaderx8":16,"myreaderx7":17,"myreaderx15":16,"myreaderx16":16,"myreaderx6":16,"myreaderx10":17,"myreaderx4":16,"myreaderx32":16,"myreaderx3":16,"myreaderx33":16,"myreaderx11":17,"myreaderx12":17,"myreaderx2":17,"myreaderx1":16,"myreaderx13":16,"myreaderx30":17,"myreaderx31":16,"myreaderx18":16,"myreaderx19":16,"myreaderx":16,"myreaderx25":16,"myreaderx27":16,"myreaderx21":17,"myreaderx22":15,"myreaderx23":17,"myreaderx24":16,"myreaderx5oss":16,"myreaderx29":16},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:29:30","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 04:29:30","id":3746,"name":" CBR - Feed ","url":"http://www.comicbookresources.com/feed.php?feed=all","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/apple-icon-57x57.fcc95351.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-43-08-409_8ce38f8de2c4dd42.png","description":"Covering comics, movies, tv like no other in the world.
