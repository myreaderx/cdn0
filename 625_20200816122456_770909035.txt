Using technology as a key resource, these organizations are showing resilience, determination and flexibility while also trying to quickly adapt to everything that’s happening this year. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/nonprofits/\">Google for Nonprofits</a> is now available in 67 countries around the world, offering free tools and resources for organizations to boost productivity, engage supporters and spread the word about their stories. Here’s how three organizations continue to make an impact with help from Google tools. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Providing workshops for budding entrepreneurs</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.fazendoacontecer.org.br/en/\">Instituto Fazendo Acontecer</a> (IFA) is a nonprofit based in São Paulo, Brazil which provides entrepreneurial education for vulnerable children and adolescents. Before COVID-19 became a concern, they ran eight types of in-person free workshops to prepare students for their professional futures and strengthen their roles as citizens, regardless of their backgrounds.</p><p>At the start of the pandemic, they worked quickly to move education programs online. They developed a <a href=\"https://www.fazendoacontecer.org.br/en/app-ifa/\">free mobile app</a> with their learning curriculum available in both English and Portuguese, so students could access workshops, educational games and training experiences from any location. IFA also started using Google Meet to create an interactive environment from home and connect teachers to students. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Instituto Fazendo Acontecer\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/CCA_Padre_Jose_4_30_jun_1.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>IFA team members use Google Meet to stay connected and develop programs. </p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>With these new app-based workshops and remote work capabilities, they soon realized this was an opportunity to expand their programs from São Paulo to more locations. So far, they have supported more than 8,000 students. IFA expects to engage 10,000 more this year by partnering with teams around the world, and they have more than doubled their instructors during the pandemic. “Google has helped us provide the tools we needed in a moment when we weren't sure how to keep our work running, and this was key for our success,” says Jose Dornelas, IFA’s president. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Bringing interactive activities online</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.calacademy.org/\">California Academy of Sciences</a> is an aquarium, planetarium and natural history museum in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park—and a powerful global voice for biodiversity research, environmental education and sustainability. Normally, they see around 1.5 million visitors every year. Prior to COVID-19, they opened their doors every Thursday night for an experience called NightLife, a themed interactive event that immerses visitors in a mix of science, art and culture. </p><p>With the museum closed due to the pandemic, they had to quickly reorganize their approach to start working remotely. In just two weeks, they started to find ways to support the community and make these nighttime programs still accessible.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"California Academy of Sciences\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_6440_Photo_by_Milan_Bhatt_2.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Viewers can now watch live streams of the Steinhart Aquarium which is home to nearly 40,000 live animals from over  900 unique species.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p></p><p>With help from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/apps-for-nonprofits/\">G Suite for Nonprofits</a>, staffers used Google Chat and Meet to stay in touch and brainstorm ideas virtually. They had dabbled in livestreaming before, so they decided to create a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS14biAqBAtGNwvFxHGET8a4SVH03ruR1\">YouTube livestream for NightLife</a>, bringing in many production partners like scientists, musicians and programming teams to create a virtually engaging experience. Their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/calacademy\">YouTube channel</a> became more popular than ever before with people tuning in to join educational programs, take part in Nightlife and to enjoy live animal webcams. With the in-person exhibits remaining closed for the time being, NightLife continues each week to bring its after-hours educational experience to the community. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Supporting volunteers and addressing uncertainty </h3><p><a href=\"https://venture2impact.org/\">Venture 2 Impact</a>, based in Halifax, Canada, works to break the cycle of poverty for individuals, families and communities by connecting skilled professionals with the communities around the world that need their support. Before the pandemic, they had tech experts travel around the world to lead workshops and trainings. But when travel was no longer safe, they had to reassess their entire strategy while helping volunteers cope with loneliness, anxiety and fear about the future. Their challenge was to figure out how to use technology to inspire hope within volunteers and continue to provide support to the communities they serve. </p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Venture2Impact\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2020-08-03_at_12.13.25_PM.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Venture 2 Impact now trains their nonprofit partners by creating content on YouTube. </p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>They focused on understanding the challenges of NGO partners by using surveys with Google Forms. Then, they determined which training videos to produce, reached out to industry experts to create them and used Google Calendar to organize the schedule. Google Meet, which is now free for everyone, was essential in delivering and recording the workshops. Then, they uploaded the videos to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJOTTJrYKVJohxKAI2OUDg/featured\">YouTube</a> to share them with their nonprofit community in India, Nepal, Thailand, Romania and Rwanda, and they organized the content into playlists to make it easier for viewers to find. </p><br/><p>To support volunteers in the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Canada, they created a mental health-focused virtual series hosted on Google Meet called WholeHearted Thursdays. They also created a room on Google Chat to share simulating articles, videos and ideas. Google tools helped them to launch new programs quickly, engage their staff, partners and volunteers in meaningful ways and tackle the problems that each community is facing. </p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/cgVQU4grp1Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/CCA_Padre_Jose_4_30_jun_1.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"3c22c5dc4c70494c5b3c37f1eb66e34e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn8@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-23-51-293_32669f41ec35b43f.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":580,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/CCA_Padre_Jose_4_30_jun_1.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-23-53-080_32669f41ec35b43f.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_6440_Photo_by_Milan_Bhatt_2.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-23-51-216_c123e5ff3b06c311.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2020-08-03_at_12.13.25_PM.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn80@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-23-52-720_97e225cf7d4263a9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/cgVQU4grp1Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-23-50-999_2af003153f37ac69.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","title":"Charlotte: Explore the Queen City with Google Arts & Culture","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/charlotte-explore-queen-city-google-arts-culture/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Welcome to Charlotte, where the downtown is actually known as “Uptown,” a striking symbol of the New South where traditional industry blends with innovation and creativity.

We are also having conversations with students using a district wide created document to check in on their health and well being.  This document has allowed us to track health concerns for students.</p><p>We can also make this fun. I have created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeAN8Xxz0q4&amp;feature=emb_logo\">video about CDC guidelines for back-to-school safety</a> with a few students and a fellow teacher.  It’s gone viral with 4.2 million views and growing in just a week!<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>As you created your back to school plans, what were the biggest hurdles you encountered? <br/></h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><b>Clark</b><b>:</b> The constant unknowns are what keep staff up at night. All districts were in survival mode in the spring, we didn’t know what was going to happen next. But now that we have time to plan, we want to be thoughtful and strategic and make sure what we’re now doing is what’s best for students. Streamlining and communicating expectations will make things clearer for staff and parents.</p><p><b>Chan:</b>The biggest challenge will be when to make the decision on transitioning from a virtual to a hybrid model and then what exactly that hybrid model will look like. We can all imagine in-person teaching and we have a better sense of what virtual learning looks like based on our spring experience. However, many of us struggle with the unknowns that a hybrid model brings, namely, how do I teach effectively when some of my students are in front of me and the rest are at home? What happens when the school needs to shut down? How do I balance my own personal life/family with my work life?</p><p><b>Lee:</b> I’m most concerned about tangible resources such as meals that students will miss out on by being out of school. I’m thinking about the social and emotional needs for students who found a refuge in coming to school.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>How did you select your plan, and what’s your district’s plan if you have to transition from in-person back to virtual or hybrid learning?  <br/></h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><b>Chan:</b> When our administration presented our virtual opening plan to the board, they did something interesting. They showed images of students pre-COVID in a classroom collaborating, and having a positive experience. Then they contrasted that with images of the socially-distant desks and the impact on a classroom environment. The impact was clear and that coming back to school wouldn’t be delivering the learning experience we want for our students, so there was support for going all virtual this fall.</p><p><b>Thomas:</b> If we need to close schools again, we will go fully remote. This should be a seamless process, since we’re already starting the school year doing three remote learning days a week. For the fall, we want to make sure that people understand that, given that we’ve had more time to plan, we’re holding ourselves to a higher standard throughout the school year. For example, in the spring we didn’t hold students accountable for completion of work or attending classes. Now attendance and completing work is required. We want to make sure students and teachers are prepared for what may come and we aren’t repeating the COVID-19 learning of the spring.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>How are you providing remote professional learning opportunities for staff? </h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><b>Chan:</b><b></b>At the end of the school year, we ran a one-day institute through video conferencing tools where we heard from both teachers and students about their experiences. We then engaged our teachers during the summer with an <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/eths202.org/e-learning-academy/intro\">e-learning academy</a>. We wanted to create consistency in our routines and tools to make virtual learning more approachable for families. Over the course of six units and a final project, all teachers will enter the fall with a Google Classroom created and a course expectations guide for each of their classes.</p><p><b>Clark:</b>We are currently creating a three day virtual training event for all teachers and administrators. We will train teachers on how to create a virtual learning environment, logistics, and resources. Teachers will leave the training with tangible deliverables (Google Classroom, virtual Bitmoji classroom, and first day expectation posted in their LMS) that will prepare them for virtual learning. There are so many changes everywhere -in some days, it feels  like everyone is a new teacher this year. So we are trying to keep things as “normal” as possible for our teachers and students, where we can or where it makes sense, so they can have some level of comfort.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>And how are you engaging with families in this process?</h2></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><b>Thomas:</b> We have innovation coaches creating a return-to-learn guide for teachers and parents too. A lot of parents are seeing these digital platforms for the first time and have no idea how to assist their students. What we try to emphasize with our staff is that the platform is their responsibility, not the parents. Parents aren’t a co-teacher but helping to facilitate access to the learning.</p><p><b>Clark:</b>We are developing and hosting live parent trainings where parents can get the exact simulations that their children will experience during their virtual learning experience. This will help create comfort for families to better support their students.</p><p><b>Lee:</b>As a school we are constantly working to remove barriers to education by supplementing resources and supplies to benefit students.  We are inviting parents to become advocates of their child’s education.  A website is being created to inform parents of their child’s process as it pertains to school. By partnering with parents as a school, we can become the support that students need to experience true success.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/_UnDrd5TOWs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Returning_to_School_COVID.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"b0d4699edbbe7982c703dc57892e0555","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-23-51-184_979b434359a2f5f3.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1000,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Returning_to_School_COVID.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn28@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-23-52-665_979b434359a2f5f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/_UnDrd5TOWs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-23-51-123_3c2727a7089996c0.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","title":"Grading made easy with Assignments, an app for your LMS","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/assignments-originality-reports-updates/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><i>Editor’s note: On August 11, 2020 Google for Education kicked off a global back-to-school event, The Anywhere School. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-product-launches\">full recap of product launches</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/back-to-school-2020\">our collection of announcements</a>.</i><br/></p><p>While educators would love to spend every second of the school day teaching students, a good portion of the day has to be devoted to administrative tasks like handing out teaching materials or grading student work. At Google, we’ve watched and listened closely as educators around the world have adapted to distance learning while carrying out the vital job of teaching, administering and engaging students. <br/></p><p>That’s why today we're launching <a href=\"http://edu.google.com/assignments/\">Assignments, an add-on application for your school’s learning management system (LMS)</a>, to general availability as a core service for all G Suite for Education schools. With Assignments as part of your LMS, you’ll be able to easily distribute and grade classwork—all with the collaborative powers of G Suite. And just like Classroom, Assignments comes with originality reports that allow educators and students to review classwork for potential plagiarism.</p><p><b>Bring the G Suite experience into your LMS</b></p><p>Assignments makes Google Docs and Google Drive compatible with your LMS, so it’s easier to assign, collect, and grade student work. It’s built with the latest Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards for robust security and easy installation. Assignments integrates with LMSs such as Canvas, Schoology, Moodle, Brightspace, Sakai, and Blackboard, or any LMS that supports LTI 1.1 or higher. Instructions on getting started and setting up Assignments in your LMS are available in the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/edu/assignments/answer/9069054?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9069280\">Assignments help center.</a> </p><p><b>Save time with a simple solution to distribute and grade</b></p><p>With Assignments, educators can automate repetitive tasks like grading and sharing coursework. For example, teachers can automatically create and distribute personalized copies of project documents for each student to edit and submit or set up Google Drive folders for a whole class. </p><p>Assignments also simplifies the grading process with easy-to-use tools, such as comment banks that store your most frequently used feedback, reusable rubrics to keep grading consistent, and the ability to make direct margin comments, strikethroughs or highlights. Not only do these tools help teachers save time and give feedback that helps students learn, they also help teachers stay organized in the face of disruption. With these tools, educators can plan semesters in advance and adapt previous class materials to be used again.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Turn-On-Assignment-in-Your-LMS-SL (2).gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Turn-On-Assignment-in-Your-LMS-SL_2.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Assignments is compatible with any LMS that supports LTI 1.1 and higher.<br/></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><b>Spot missed citations and possible plagiarism with enhanced originality reports</b></p><p>Reviewing writing projects to make sure they are original helps make sure students are thinking critically and developing authentic work. <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/products/originality/\">Originality reports</a>, which are built into both Assignments and Classroom, provide educators with flags for potential plagiarism in student work and also help students quickly identify passages that may need citations. Educators and students can use originality reports without leaving Assignments, making it easier and faster to check work.<br/></p><p>Over the coming weeks, we’re improving originality reports so that more educators and students can benefit from them. We’re increasing the number of free assignments educators can use the feature with, making reports available in new languages, and adding the ability to print, save and download reports for easy sharing.

Yet we sought a more powerful platform with wider device choice and stronger management features for our fleet. With Android Enterprise, we could manage many device types and secure our data while providing private personal usage.<br/><br/></p><h3>All aboard with Android</h3><p>SNCF undertook two key initiatives as part of our transition away from a legacy management system. Our first project was to deploy 12,000 rugged devices to our passenger ticket inspectors and train managers. They’re connected to portable printers and mobile point of sale devices for scanning tickets and accepting payments when passengers begin their journey. </p><p>Our teams use our internal apps for confirming schedules, answering passenger questions and connecting customers to our services from the platform and aboard trains. As dedicated devices, they can be shared by our 16,000 employees who can pick it right up and access our key services.<br/><br/></p><h3>Simplifying the customer experience</h3><p>With another project we deployed another 21,500 devices that serve as the primary digital tool for passenger information officers on trains and in stations. These personally-enabled devices include 40 key applications for our frontline teams to assist with passenger support and communication—these apps are critical for services like helping passengers with their seat assignments and requesting services for those who may need additional attention like children or those with reduced mobility. Safety is essential, which is why we provide our teams with a passenger safety app that lets agents trigger an alert with a single gesture to quickly reach security personnel.</p><p>During the rise of the pandemic, our teams could assist passengers with their seat assignments while still complying with critical social distancing requirements. And our internal productivity suite apps are pushed out so everyone can access the services they need.</p><p>With these devices we sought to give our employees privacy and control over their personal information by enabling the Android <a href=\"https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6191949?hl=en\">work profile</a>. This remains separate from the personal profile and gives IT specific controls over work apps and data. Our employees expect this type of privacy, and our IT team still has the enterprise-grade controls it needs to protect corporate resources. The work profile has been popular with our employees, and we plan to expand this deployment further.<br/><br/></p><h3>Growing mobility with Android</h3><p>Along with expanding the number of devices, we plan to start using Android <a href=\"https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/7514005?hl=en\">zero-touch enrollment</a> with future device rollouts to further streamline our processes, as our frontline employees will be able to receive a device with apps and configurations already set. </p><p>Android Enterprise gives us a strong foundation to expand our mobility ambitions, and we look forward to supporting our frontline teams and finding new ways that mobility can enhance the customer experience.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/yLfBX932uZU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/SNCF_Android.max-1300x1300.png","linkMd5":"0fff7c7b25384d47a1b681785dd5b96d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-23-51-192_8133598dee4ce5ed.webp","metaImg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/SNCF_Android.max-1300x1300.png","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":541,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/yLfBX932uZU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-23-52-753_f0182a790736b0f1.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","title":"Google integrates into IAB Europe TCF v2.0","link":"https://blog.google/products/admanager/google-integrates-iab-europe-tcf-v2/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Providing people with transparency and control over how their data is used—and ensuring their choices are respected—are key pillars of Google’s approach to developing advertising products. In a complex digital advertising ecosystem, we’re committed to supporting efforts to manage user consent and compliance through a standardized framework. That’s why by August 15, 2020, we’ll integrate our ads systems with the IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) v2.0, in line with the switchover date from v1.0 set by the IAB Europe.</p><br/><p>As a member of IAB Europe's TCF Working Group, we contributed to the development of TCF v2.0. This new framework standardizes the process of gathering, managing and communicating user permissions for how their information may be used in the advertising supply chain. Most significantly, it means that people can make choices on a per vendor and per purpose basis, and this choice will be respected in the ads that are served by all participating platforms. With improved interoperability, publishers and marketers using TCF v2.0 have more control and flexibility about how they integrate and collaborate with their technology partners, including Google. </p><br/><p>To support our partners with the transition, we will give them a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9999955\">90-day grace period</a> from August 15 to ensure their implementation is working properly and meeting our policy requirements. </p><br/><p>Our integration with the TCF v2.0 applies to ads we serve on publisher inventory and not Google owned and operated inventory, for which consent is obtained through our own consent flows. The integration also doesn’t change any of our policies for publishers or marketers, including our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/\">EU User Consent Policy,</a> which helps ensure users have transparency into and control over how their data is being collected and used to serve personalized ads.</p><br/><p>It is up to our partners whether they choose to use TCF v2.0. Publishers can still continue to work with Google independently by using the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9012903\">Ad Technology Provider controls</a> we launched in 2018 across Ad Manager, AdSense and AdMob. Marketers can still continue to work with Google independently by using the features launched in 2018 across Google Ads and Display &amp; Video 360. These controls will continue to function outside of the TCF v2.0. </p><br/><p>This integration marks the successful collaboration across our industry for a standardized framework that combines both ease of use and interoperability, and will give people greater control over how their data is used.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/8R5tJ-FNLn4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 05:00:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://blog.google/static/blogv2/images/google-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"7b8d7f79cdf79f5a8b7555123d897f79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-23-51-262_6e554fa84199a90c.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.google/static/blogv2/images/google-1000x1000.png","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1000,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/8R5tJ-FNLn4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-23-51-099_57b072146c92996d.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","title":"Finding live TV shows and sports just got easier in Search","link":"https://blog.google/products/search/finding-live-tv-shows-and-sports-just-got-easier-search/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Sports around the world look a little different this year, with important new measures to keep players, officials and fans safe.

She later watched her parents put away savings for years to be able to afford college tuition for their daughters. From a very young age, she came to understand the meaning and importance of a good education. </p><br/><p>Today, as the VP of <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/\">Google for Education</a>, Avni works every day to help build tools that make a  high-quality education available to everyone. That mission is especially important now as widespread school closures from the COVID-19 pandemic have challenged schools and families to quickly adjust to distance learning.  </p><br/><p>Through it all, Avni remains optimistic about the future of education and the role technology can play in shaping it. She says that over the past few months the resiliency of teachers and students alike has inspired her, and that there have been “bright spots” of positivity.  </p><br/><p><b>How do you explain your job at a dinner party?</b></p><br/><p>My team builds tools for teachers, students, and education leaders to help improve teaching and learning at scale. One thing that’s great about working at Google is that describing my job is pretty easy, and always a great conversation starter—I get lots of feature requests (and bug reports 🙂) wherever I go. </p><br/><p><b>The use of technology in education is especially important now. What are you most excited about?</b></p><br/><p>It’s been amazing to see the role technology has played to keep learning happening, no matter what. As I look ahead to the next six to twelve months, I’m excited about working alongside teachers, education leaders and students to build tools that can really meet their needs, both now—in this ever-changing situation—and for the future.</p><br/><p>What we’ve seen in the past few months is an unexpected acceleration towards the digitization of education and learning. As that shift continues to happen, I see an opportunity longer-term to unlock even more of the potential of technology and the role it can play in being helpful to teachers, students and families. While tech is only part of the solution and there’s still a lot of work left to do, it’s clear that technology will have a unique part in shaping the future of education.</p><br/><p><b>What has surprised you the most over the past six months?</b></p><br/><p>The adaptability and resiliency of everyone, especially teachers. Teachers, schools and entire governments across the world had to quickly adjust to huge changes when schools started closing, and in many cases, the shift to distance learning happened in a matter of days.</p><br/><p>I saw it with my own daughter. Back in March, her school closed on a Thursday, and by Monday, the whole school was up and running with a full virtual curriculum. They literally went from zero to distance learning in seventy-two hours. And that story isn’t unique—we hear stories like this from our teachers and students all over the world.</p><br/><p>What’s more is that my daughter’s class continued to adapt and adjust. I remember their first video call and hearing twenty second graders talking all at once—it was definitely a bit chaotic. But the students, teachers and administrators quickly adapted. And now my daughter is teaching me things like what online classroom etiquette looks like. </p><br/><p><b>How have you and your team stayed motivated? </b></p><p></p><p>Over the past few months, my team started a weekly tradition called “bright spots” where we share inspiring stories about how teachers, students and families use our tools. </p><br/><p>We’ve heard creative ways teachers turn their homes into virtual classrooms—including one teacher who used their shower as a whiteboard surface. There was also a family in New Zealand who sent a photo of a distance learning classroom they built on top of a hill so they could have access to satellite Wi-Fi; it was made out of a generator-powered farm trailer! </p><br/><p><b>Who has been a strong female influence in your life?</b></p><br/><p>My mom. She’s incredibly hardworking and approaches life with this calm, yet tireless, optimism. When she and my dad moved to the U.S. from Mumbai, she worked multiple jobs to help make ends meet and taught herself English by watching Nick at Nite on TV. Later on, she worked full time while she studied (and passed) the CPA exam, and she moved in to help me when my first child was born—while still working herself. </p><br/><p>I started keeping a list of all the positive things that wouldn’t have happened if COVID wasn’t here to remind myself that there are nuggets of good. Getting to see my mom every day is definitely on the list. She lives in Alabama and I live in California, but since the pandemic, my kids video call her every day.</p><br/><p><b>What advice do you have for women starting out in their careers?</b></p><br/><p>Careers are not linear, and things that feel like sideways or downward movement can still be progress. Be open to opportunities that might be surprising or sound scary because that's usually where learning and growth happen. </p><br/><p>I’ve been at Google for seventeen years and moved around the company quite a bit, working on Search, Maps, Chrome and now Google for Education. Some transitions were harder than others. For example, there was the time when I moved to Zurich, took on a new role, became a manager for the first time, and got married—all within the span of three weeks. Every time I made a transition, I had to learn about an entirely new product, industry and team, and where I could fit in. But every transition helped me get used to feeling uncomfortable and learning new things again. And, in hindsight, I can see how each of those moves was extremely valuable.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/zWI7O-XIqt4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Hero_1_7tHcjmy.max-1300x1300.jpg","linkMd5":"e66d2c430222d96101c4aeb81a1bd668","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-23-52-142_eb38bc8bff08af10.webp","metaImg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Hero_1_7tHcjmy.max-1300x1300.jpg","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":541,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/zWI7O-XIqt4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn99@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-23-51-115_cfaaae5126a027ef.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","title":"Update your Business Profile on Google Maps and Search","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/business-profile-maps-and-search/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>When it comes to your business’s online presence, putting your best foot forward matters.

Our Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and our Trust and Safety teams work together to identify and prevent government-backed attacks against Google and our users. The Threat Analysis Group has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1268589219842109440?s=20\">flagged</a> phishing attempts we’ve identified against campaigns and continues to <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q2-2020/\">share</a> regular updates about actions we take against coordinated influence campaigns on our platforms. </p><p>To stay ahead of threats, we meet regularly with government agencies responsible for election integrity and other technology companies to discuss trends. As we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googlepubpolicy/status/1293633488927825921\">reiterated</a> yesterday, this coordination is critical and will continue through the election. </p><p>We’ve seen incredible engagement in our election security trainings with <a href=\"https://annenberg.usc.edu/news/spotlight/support-google-usc-annenberg-expands-effort-protect-elections-digital-attacks\">USC’s Annenberg School</a>. In fact, the nonpartisan trainers have already trained over 3,000 campaigns and election officials on how to prevent digital attacks, phishing campaigns and hacking attempts—and they plan to complete sessions in all 50 states by September. </p><p>Additionally, to help people involved in campaigns, we recently launched enhanced security for Google accounts to complement our <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/\">Advanced Protection Program</a>, offering additional safeguards for G Suite and Gmail users during the election season. People can <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fb/forms/enhanced-security/\">easily self-nominate</a> to receive additional security checks for active threats and suspicious activity, like hacking and phishing.</p><br/>Last year, we introduced <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/update-our-political-ads-policy/\">new policies</a> for election ads and limited the ways political campaigns can target their ads—taking more steps to eliminate micro-targeting of voters. To build on these efforts, we recently <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9991401?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265\">expanded</a> our policies - such as prohibiting ads that disseminate <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9991623?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265\">illegally obtained materials</a>. We also <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6020955?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\">enforce policies</a> to prohibit content on our platforms that undermines trust in the democratic process, like calls to participate in voter fraud or false claims around the U.S. census or election results. We’re also updating our <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/home?hl=en\">Political Ads Transparency Report</a> to include more information about the election ads that run on our platform, new ways to sort campaign spending, and more frequent updates—giving people detailed insight into the political ads that run on Google and YouTube. <br/><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Connecting people to the democratic process</h3><p></p><p>With both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions set to be virtual, we want to make sure you can still follow these historic events at home. You can watch next week’s Democratic National Convention live on YouTube, and you can tune in to the Republican National Convention on YouTube the following week. This continues our longstanding tradition of live-streaming major political events—including State of the Union addresses, debates and conventions. YouTube aims to keep you virtually connected to the political activities this election season, which you can read more about <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-on-how-youtube-supports-elections\">here</a>. </p><p>We’ll also be updating our<a href=\"https://news.app.goo.gl/2020_Elections_Keyword\">2020 Elections experience</a> on Google News, to include extensive coverage of major issues, live streams of major events, and reminders of registration and voting timelines.</p><p>As we approach November’s election, we will continue to ensure that all of our products are built -- and our policies are enforced—in a fair, objective, and nonpartisan way, without regard to political ideology. Our platforms have empowered people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences.

Check out the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-product-launches\">full recap of product launches</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/back-to-school-2020\">our collection of announcements</a>.</i></p><p>Educators, students and families have quickly adjusted to distance learning, and administrators have played a critical role in this success. Over the past few months, they’ve equipped teachers and learners with the tools they need. We’ve listened to what admins need to save time and meet new demands, and have made improvements so they are better equipped to keep supporting educators and students this school year.</p><p><b>Powerful insights in Classroom</b></p><p>Coming soon, admins who want to troubleshoot Classroom issues will be able to access Classroom audit logs directly from the Admin console. With audit logs, they’ll be able to pinpoint events such as who removed a student from a class or who archived a specific class on a specific date. </p><p>Especially now, we’ve heard that admins want dashboards that give them detailed visibility into usage and adoption of Classroom so they can provide targeted training to teachers, or help intervene with students who aren’t engaged. At schools with G Suite Enterprise for Education, admins will soon be able to automatically import Classroom logs into BigQuery, where they can get much deeper insights into who is using Classroom and how they’re using it. With just a few clicks, they can also create a customizable dashboard on Data Studio, giving them a slate of engagement metrics, including metrics like how many assignments were created, submitted, or graded, and will be able to pivot by date, organizational unit, specific instructors, or specific students. </p><p><b>Moderation tools for Meet</b></p><p>Meet has become a common tool for teachers and students to connect with each other. As more people rely on Meet, the need for improved moderation tools has grown.</p><p>Admins can already get insights into how students and teachers interact with Google Meet using the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/9204857\">Meet Quality Tool</a> within the Admin console. Admins can see an overview of meeting metrics, find and debug meetings, view network statistics (like jitter, packet loss and congestion), or view system (CPU) statistics. They can now <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/9204857?hl=en#details:~:text=You%20need%20to%20be%20a%20super,assign%20the%20role%20to%20the%20user.\">delegate access to the tool</a> to other people in their organization using a custom privilege in the Admin roles section. Plus, just like in Classroom, admins can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/9186729?hl=en\">access Meet audit logs</a> in the Admin console.<br/></p><p>Admins also have the ability to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/9493952\">enable or disable Meet independently of Chat</a>. And now, Meet blocks anonymous attendees by default for Edu domains; <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/07/anonymous-users-will-be-blocked-from.html\">admins have the option to change this setting</a> as needed.</p><p><b>Better workflows for G Suite</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>As schools increasingly use G Suite to support distance learning, they’re looking for easier ways to communicate and share knowledge. To improve school-wide or small group communication, admins can use the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/9687393\">improved Google Groups experience</a> to create and manage groups. Also, a new <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/9890318\">beta</a> will allow teams to share<a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/05/share-folders-in-shared-drives-beta-google.html\">specific folders within a Shared Drive</a> to help admins make sure that the right information can be shared with the right people. </p><p>SmartCompose, which automatically suggests words and phrases, and Auto Correct, which corrects misspellings or grammar issues, are <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/06/google-docs-assistive-writing-autocorrect-smart-compose-education.html\">both now available in Docs</a> for education customers. By the end of this month, admins will be able to disable both SmartCompose and Auto Correct if they choose. </p><p><b>A simpler way to trial G Suite Enterprise for Education</b></p><p>Lastly, admins who are interested in starting a trial with G Suite Enterprise for Education will soon be able to do so directly without support from a reseller. In order to activate the one-time 30-day trial, admins can enroll from the Billing section of the G Suite Admin console and provision up to 10 team members. <br/></p><p>Admins make Google for Education tools work smoothly behind the scenes, so educators and students can get down to work. We hope the new features smooth out the rough spots in the admin workday.

But wherever learning takes place—at home, in person or a combination of both—Chromebooks help teachers keep teaching and students keep learning even when they aren’t in the same room together.  <br/></p><p>Last spring we saw students and teachers turn to Chromebooks as schools shifted to distance learning. Hundreds of thousands of students in the New York City and Chicago school districts brought Chromebooks home, giving them a familiar learning experience during a stressful and uncertain time. In Japan, students at Saitama’s Koshigaya Minami High School were able to keep learning with a Chromebook Loaner Program. And at Mexico’s University of Guadalajara, high school students who didn’t have devices at home were able to continue their learning through 1:1 Chromebook device programs. </p><p>We’re continuing to add new apps and features to Chromebooks to make them useful as students and teachers go back to school—whether it’s virtually or in person. And for administrators, we’re continuing to share best practices on how <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9773702?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7679105\">to prepare Chromebooks to go home with students</a> as this new year unfolds.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>New admin features for enabling accessibility </h3><p>Admins can now use over 200 policies from the Admin console to customize the Chromebook experience for students and educators. For all of the latest, including the ability to set <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7679408#84\">device accessibility policies</a>, check out the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7679408?hl=en\">Chrome Enterprise Release Notes</a>. Another policy admins can set is <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3273084?hl=en\">kiosk mode</a>, which allows the exam app to run in full-screen mode on the device, and stops students from accessing the web while they’re taking a test. When using kiosk mode for testing, Chromebook accessibility features are now more readily available and customizable—like screen readers, magnification and more. To access even more accessibility features, some  testing providers, such as Pearson, make it possible to access third-party accessibility tools from partners like Don Johnston and Texthelp.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"screen in CB@2x.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/screen_in_CB2x.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Using built in Chromebook accessibility features in kiosk mode</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Find and purchase apps with the Chromebook App Hub</h3><p>In January, <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/creativityapps-chromebooks/\">we announced</a> that you could manage apps more easily with our app licensing system within Google Admin Console. Now, you can <a href=\"https://chromebookapphub.withgoogle.com/app-licensing\">purchase a collection of six creativity apps</a>(you can buy one, a few or all) available through Acer, Lenovo, Dell and their partners—which include Infinite Painter, Squid, Book Creator, Soundtrap, Explain Everything and WeVideo—all on the <a href=\"http://g.co/chromebookapphub\">Chromebook App Hub</a>.</p><p>In schools, IT admins control all aspects of the Android app experience on Chromebooks, including choosing the apps that students can see on their Managed Google Play Store. For all school administrators, check out our best practices for <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9962839\">deploying Android apps</a> to a fleet of devices.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://g.co/chromebookapphub\">Chromebook App Hub</a> is a great resource for educators to find useful apps and new ideas on how to use them in the classroom. You can now search for apps by integration, purchase plan and more. And a related-ideas carousel offers inspiration for new and creative apps to try. Here are a few Android and web apps available on Chromebooks that have new features for Back to School:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"http://chromebookapphub.withgoogle.com/apps/minecraft-education-edition\">Minecraft: Education Edition</a>, one of the most popular educational apps, is now available on Chromebooks as an Android app. G Suite for Education users can also expect to have the ability to log-in with their G Suite for Education accounts this coming year.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://chromebookapphub.withgoogle.com/apps/classcraft\">Classcraft’s</a> new self-grading Google Forms Quiz for Classcraft Quests saves time for teachers.

Now, if parents create a Google account for a child and sign in on a Chromebook, they can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9900467?hl=en\">add their child's G Suite for Education account</a>.  When parents add their child’s school account for a Family Link user, the student can see their assignments in Google Classroom, work on papers and presentations for school, and sign into websites, apps and extensions using the school account—all with a parent’s supervision.

Doing so typically requires businesses to add JavaScript code written by these partners, also known as third-party tags, directly to their websites. But when too many tags load on a site, it can negatively affect the customer experience--and conversion rates. Plus, since third-party tags running directly on a site could have broad access to information entered on that page, it’s important for businesses to have control over what information those tags can access.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>To help address these challenges, we’re introducing Server-Side Tagging to <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/\">Google Tag Manager</a> and <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager-360/\">Tag Manager 360</a>. You’ll now be able to move many third-party tags off your site and into a new server container hosted in your <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud</a> account. That means when customers interact with a page on your site, third-party tags are loaded directly in the server container rather than the site. This provides you with faster page load times, greater security for your customer data, and additional data controls.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Deliver faster site experiences to your customers</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>When you move third-party tags off your site, fewer tags must load when your customers visit – leading to faster page load times. A recent <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/mobile-page-speed-data/\">research study</a> showed that a decrease in page load times for mobile sites improved progression rates for every step of the purchase funnel for all brands surveyed. In fact, for retail sites every 0.1 second reduction in mobile site speed on average increases average order value by nearly 10 percent.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Consider an ecommerce retailer that works with many technology partners to execute marketing campaigns and measure customer behavior. Whenever this retailer wants to work with a new partner, for example to run email marketing campaigns, it needs to add a new third-party tag to its site to measure success. Instead of doing that, the retailer can now place the new tag into its server container in Tag Manager. And when a customer loads the retailer’s site, this tag will run in the server container after the page loads. This allows businesses to measure the success of their campaign without impacting the customer experience.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Secure your customer data</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>When customers engage with your business online, they share information with you. You want to ensure that information is safe and only authorized partners are able to access it.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>When third-party tags are implemented directly on your site, these tags are able to access and interact with other information customers are entering into your site. With Server-Side Tagging, you place third-party tags in a secure server container in your Google Cloud project. This means tags in your server container only have access to information sent to the server and no longer have access to the information entered on your site. And because these tags are placed into your server container, you gain visibility into what data the tags are collecting and where that information is being sent.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Control the behavior of third-party tags</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Tag Manager already allows you to control third-party tag behavior through a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates/sandboxed-javascript\">sandboxed version of JavaScript</a>, ready-to-go tag templates from<a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9454109\">the Community Template Gallery</a>, and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107011\">a permissions model</a> for all third-party tags. All of these capabilities continue to be available with Server-Side Tagging.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Each tag that you add to your server container will have to declare how it will behave, for example which cookies can be accessed or where data can be sent. And you can also set policies to automatically control what tags are allowed to do. This helps you ensure that any new tags added to your container follow the same permissions so you do not need to continuously check tag behaviors in the future.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Get started with Server-Side Tagging</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Server-Side Tagging is now available to all Tag Manager and Tag Manager 360 accounts.

At Google, we’re honored to work on tools that lighten the load for teachers, school leaders, families, and especially the students who have navigated learning from home with grace and resilience. </p><p>As educators worldwide have reinvented their practice online, we’re also adapting our tools to meet the evolving needs of their new educational landscape. This year, we’re taking a virtual approach to “back to school” with <a href=\"https://educationonair.withgoogle.com/events/anywhereschool2020\">The Anywhere School</a>, bringing Google for Education announcements to hundreds of thousands of viewers in more than 250 countries around the world. </p><p>Inspired by your feedback, we’re sharing over 50 new features across Meet, Classroom, G Suite and other products. Check out <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/back-to-school-2020\">our other posts</a> for deeper dives into the features, and continue to <a href=\"http://goo.gle/theanywhereschool\">watch the keynote sessions</a>, which are running live for the next 24 hours and will be available on demand if you need to catch up later. Here’s a birds-eye view of what’s coming. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>A safer, more engaging Meet experience</h3><p>Earlier this year, we <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/new-meet-features-for-edu/\">announced new features</a> coming to Google Meet to improve moderation and engagement. Today, we’re sharing <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-meet-classroom-updates\">more details</a> about these upcoming launches and when they’ll be available. Here are a few highlights:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>In September, we’ll kick off with a larger tiled view of up to 49 people and an integrated Jamboard whiteboard for collaboration. We’ll also release new controls so moderators can choose to always join first, end meetings for all participants, disable in-meeting chat, and much more.</p></li><li><p>In October, we’ll launch custom and blurred backgrounds to provide some extra privacy. Breakout rooms and attendance tracking will also be launching for all Google Enterprise for Education customers, allowing for more engaged classes and insights on participation.</p></li><li><p>Later this year, we’re rolling out hand raising for all customers and Q&amp;A and polling for G Suite Enterprise for Education customers. Plus, we’ll launch a new temporary recordings feature which will be available to all Education customers for free (premium recordings will still be part of G Suite Enterprise for Education). </p></li></ul><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Better support for students, educators and admins in Classroom</h3><p>With more teachers around the world using Classroom more than ever before, we’re working to make Classroom simpler and more efficient with <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-meet-classroom-updates\">new features</a>.  </p><ul><li>A new to-do widget on the Classes page will help students see what’s coming up, what’s missing, and what’s been graded. </li><li>Teachers can now share a link to invite students to their class, which makes joining a class much easier. </li><li>Classroom will soon be available in 10 additional languages, for 54 languages total.</li></ul><p>Classroom also gives you access to originality reports, which are now better than ever. For example, educators can soon run originality reports five times per course (up from three previously). And with G Suite Enterprise for Education, educators will be able to see matches for potential plagiarism not only against webpages, but between student submissions at their school. <br/></p><p>We’re giving <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/back-to-school-gfe-admins\">admins more powerful tools</a> to manage G Suite and Classroom. For example, school leaders with Enterprise licenses will have greater visibility into Classroom usage via new Data Studio dashboards, which allow admins to see active classes, measure feature adoption, and monitor teacher and student engagement. To support teachers and admins, we’re making it easier to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/9356588?hl=en\">sync Classroom grades</a> with a push to your Student Information System (SIS), starting with Infinite Campus customers (and more SIS to come). <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-meet-classroom-updates\">Keep reading</a> for more details on what’s new in Classroom.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Enhance your learning management system with Assignments</h3>Our newest product for non-Classroom users is <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/assignments-originality-reports-updates\">Assignments,</a> an application for your learning management system (LMS) that gives educators a faster, simpler way to distribute, analyze and grade student work. This time-saving application helps educators automatically create and distribute personalized copies of classwork to each student's Google Drive folder, quickly provide feedback, and keep grading consistent and transparent with originality reports. Assignments is compatible with any LMS that supports LTI 1.1 and higher such as Canvas, Schoology, Blackboard and more. <br/></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Help students turn in their best work with Docs</h3><p>We recently launched <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/06/google-docs-assistive-writing-autocorrect-smart-compose-education.html\">SmartCompose and Auto Correct</a> in Docs for educators and students. This will help them compose high-quality content faster by cutting back on repetitive writing, while reducing the chance of spelling and grammatical errors (by the end of this month, admins will be able to disable both SmartCompose and Auto Correct if they choose). Soon we’re also launching citations so students can format and manage their sources directly in Docs. With the citations tool, after adding the relevant attributes for a source, students can insert formatted in-text citations or a bibliography.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>New resources and tools that continue to support families</h3><p>As many parents and guardians supported their childrens’ learning from home this year, we heard about a big need for more resources and training for families on Google’s tools. To help, we’ve created the <a href=\"http://goo.gle/techtoolkit-families\">Tech Toolkit for Families and Guardians</a>, which helps parents better understand the technology that their kids use in the classroom. Plus, we’ve added <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9900467?hl=en\">school accounts to Chrome OS</a> so students can access Classroom and their school files while having the safety net of Family Link. We’re sharing many more product <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/parents-become-teachers\">updates for families here.</a></p><p>Finally, educators can find free training, resources, and professional development programs like the new <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/teacher-center/programs/certified-coach/?modal_active=none\">Certified Coach program</a> to support them as they use these tools and features in their classroom in the new <a href=\"http://g.co/teachercenter\">Teacher Center</a>. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Moving forward together</h3><p>There’s so much more to share with you about what’s coming to Google for Education, and we encourage you to take some time to <a href=\"http://goo.gle/theanywhereschool\">watch the keynote sessions</a> from The Anywhere School event for all the updates. </p><br/><p>Most importantly, thank you for your partnership. We’re grateful for the insights you’ve shared with us, and we’ll continue to evolve our products to meet the unique needs of this moment. By working together, we can provide students with the education they deserve, no matter where it’s taking place.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/eOiilRH7jlk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:30:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/039-B2S-Blog-1-Best-of-Back-to-School-SL-v1.gif","linkMd5":"93d96a99700a5e4071673a7f0cda122f","metaImg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/039-B2S-Blog-1-Best-of-Back-to-School-SL-v1.gif","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/eOiilRH7jlk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-23-51-324_e44bed9a86a00d4d.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","title":"When parents become teachers: tools to help students at home","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/parents-become-teachers/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><i>Editor’s note: On August 11, 2020 Google for Education kicked off a global back-to-school event, The Anywhere School.

I’m still adjusting to my children making appearances on my Google Meet meetings, trying to schedule more walking meetings to squeeze in some exercise, and creating a schedule that my children will only loosely follow. Luckily, nobody knows about the chaos that ensues behind the scenes thanks to Google Meet’s <a href=\"https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9919960?hl=en#:~:text=Turn%20noise%20cancellation%20on%20or%20off&amp;text=Go%20to%20the%20Meet%20homepage.&amp;text=Select%20Audio.,Click%20Done.\">noise cancellation feature</a>!<br/></p><p>With these changes, you may realize that you need a crash course in algebra or Shakespeare, and one on the digital tools your kids are using.

She’d been working in data processing at a tech company for six years but recently found herself wanting “something more meaningful.” “I felt like the long nights and weekends, the overtime and stress, didn’t contribute to making anyone’s life better,” Nikiya says. “Especially my own.” </p><p>Nikiya decided to leave her job in tech and pivot toward a career in academic research, beginning work at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences College of Public Health. “I built a web-based application that disseminated county-level health data for the state of Arkansas,” she says. That led to more work creating systems for public health and institutional research. Today, she still supports that very first project, as well as works on creating new web and mobile applications focused on digital health and access for people in underserved areas. </p><p>Nikiya is also a Women Techmakers Ambassador in her town of Little Rock, Arkansas. <a href=\"https://www.womentechmakers.com/\">Women Techmakers</a> is a Google-created community that works to promote the visibility and opportunities for women in tech. I recently caught up with Nikiya to learn more about her career in making public-facing tech applications, as well as how Women Techmakers has helped her find community. </p><br/><p><b>What do you get out of the Women Techmakers community?</b></p><p>I feel so empowered, included and supported as part of Women Techmakers. Everyone deserves to be valued and heard and to have access to opportunities that help us grow as developers or any industry. The group gives us amazing tools to be able to uplift women and support them in their careers. There’s something about being part of a community that helps you when you feel like giving up; that encourages you to keep going.</p><p>Community organizing takes a lot of effort. It means reaching out to people who tell you “no” sometimes. Starting a community like this is an incredible experience in teaching, leadership, perseverance and organization. I learn a lot. Not just about tech, but also about people and how to figure out what the community needs. </p><p><b>What inspired you to enter the public health space?</b></p><p>I want to be a technologist for social good. I get to work with students, epidemiologists, data scientists, researchers and clinicians with different areas of expertise and different areas of research and be a part of their amazing work. I believe the pandemic has shown us the importance of looking out for others. I’m hopeful that by combining my love for education, science and technology, I can be a part of making our community better.</p><p><b>What is the tech industry in Little Rock like?</b></p><p>There’s a lot of opportunity for tech here, although many may not realize this at first. Major employers like Walmart, Sam's Club and Tyson Foods are located here. There’s also a small tech community in the central area around Little Rock, as well as a few startups.</p><p><b>There are a lot of misconceptions about the tech industry. What do you wish more people knew?</b></p><p>Sometimes when we think about tech, we think about “big tech.” I’m challenging myself and others to think about how we can use tech in traditionally non-tech spaces. I ask myself, how can we use tech to improve education, fair housing, healthcare? To reduce poverty, prejudice and racial injustice? </p><p><b>Do you have any advice for other women in tech?</b></p><p>As a woman, it has been a lot to juggle a career, raise a family, pursue more education and take care of myself. My call to action is to show yourself some grace. Be kind to yourself, too. There are days when it’s not all going to get done. You will probably drop a ball or two. It’s OK. </p><br/></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/6b1XsRnX7FA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Nikiya_Simpson_Public_Health_Technologist_.max-1300x1300.jpg","linkMd5":"a7f01225f69de3b36ca9325ee06e7164","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn21@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-23-51-197_a8618b90b2d1daaf.webp","metaImg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Nikiya_Simpson_Public_Health_Technologist_.max-1300x1300.jpg","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":541,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/6b1XsRnX7FA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-23-52-243_4ed8db9ed287f087.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","title":"More details on what's coming to Meet and Classroom","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-meet-classroom-updates/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><i>Editor’s note: On August 11, 2020 Google for Education kicked off a global back-to-school event, The Anywhere School. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-product-launches\">full recap of product launches</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/back-to-school-2020\">our collection of announcements</a>.</i></p><p>Google has always aimed to invest in products, programs and philanthropy that make learning possible for everyone, anywhere. This year we’ve been especially inspired by the teachers and students around the world who have used our tools in new creative ways and at unprecedented scale. <br/></p><p>As schools start this next semester, we’re excited to share the many new capabilities we’re bringing to Meet and Classroom, to support teaching and learning, no matter where it’s taking place. Let’s start with what’s coming to Meet.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Control for moderators </h3><p>Over the next few months, we’re giving moderators of Education meetings more controls for managing their virtual classes. Here are new capabilities, arriving in September, that moderators will have:</p><ul><li>Prohibit participants from joining meetings after they’ve been ejected or after they’ve been denied entry twice (launching later this month) </li><li>End meetings for all participants when class is finished</li><li>Manage join requests with ease by accepting or rejecting them in bulk</li><li>Disable in-meeting chat and set restrictions on who can present during a meeting </li><li>A setting that requires the teacher to join first</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Interactivity in Meet </h3><p>Opportunities for interactivity are critical for distance learning and we’re sharing new features to increase engagement with your students virtually:</p><p><i>Launching in September</i></p><ul><li><p>A larger tiled views with a 7x7 grid so you can see up to 49 students at once </p></li><li><p>A collaborative whiteboard with Jamboard in Meet so you can encourage students to share ideas and try creative approaches to lessons </p></li></ul><p><i>Launching in October</i></p><ul><li><p>Blur or replace backgrounds so everyone feels more comfortable during distance-learning classes.

With this new feature, any meeting host can record a meeting and share the recording within their domain for up to 30 days before the video expires. Given disparities in internet access, temporary recordings are intended to help students or meeting participants replay a class or session they couldn't attend live. Temporary recordings cannot be shared outside the host’s domain or downloaded. We’re granting continued free access to premium recordings until temporary recordings are available later this year (note: this is replacing the <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/04/extending-availability-of-google-meet-features.html\">promotion</a> for access to premium Meet features including live streaming and meetings of up to 250 participants that will be ending on September 30th). </p><p></p><p>Now, let’s cover new features you can expect in Classroom.</p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Helping students and instructors stay on top of their upcoming work</h3><p>Both students and instructors have risen to the challenge of learning and teaching from home, but it can be tough to stay on top of what they need to do and when. To help instructors and students better discover and track their work in Classroom, the Classes page will soon have a to-do widget for students and a to-review widget for teachers.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"To-Do-List-Improvements.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/To-Do-List-Improvements.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>New, easier ways to join classes</h3><p>In addition to sharing course join codes, educators can now share a link to join classes with a single click. Link-sharing allows educators to share classes anywhere they communicate with students, including in messaging platforms such as WhatsApp.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Link-Based-Class-Joining-Share-Mobile.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Link-Based-Class-Joining-Share-Mobile.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Spot missed citations with enhanced originality reports</h3><p><a href=\"https://edu.google.com/products/originality/\">Originality reports</a>, which are built into Classroom and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/assignments-originality-reports-updates\">Assignments</a>, provide educators with flags for potential plagiarism in student work and also help students quickly identify passages that may need citations. Now, we’re making originality reports even more helpful.</p><p>First, we’re raising the number of originality reports that educators can use per class from three to five. (Educators with G Suite Enterprise for Education licenses will continue to get unlimited originality reports.) Educators will also be able to print, save and download reports to share with students, parents and administrators. Soon educators and students will be able to run originality reports on Google Slides, in addition to Google Docs, as well as in multiple languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, Indonesian and Italian.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Check for potential plagiarism between students </h3><p>Traditionally, originality reports have surfaced matches for potential plagiarism against hundreds of billions of web pages and over 40 million books. Now, instructors with G Suite Enterprise for Education licenses will be able to see potential plagiarism between students at their school. Starting in a few weeks, originality reports will check submissions against a private, school-owned repository of past student work to look for student-to-student matches. Student submissions are automatically added when instructors use originality reports in Classroom. If admins want to actively manage the repository, they can manually add files or remove documents directly. Google never has access to or the ability to use this repository—it’s owned and used solely by the school domain.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"school matches.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/school_matches_7vu1UaV.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>More visibility and tools for Classroom admins</h3>Coming soon, we’re rolling out <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/back-to-school-gfe-admins\">additional tools for admins</a>who want to troubleshoot Classroom issues or gain deeper insights into usage across their domain. For example, all Education admins will now have access to Classroom audit logs, and admins with an Enterprise license will also be able to export their logs to BigQuery or create a customizable dashboard on Data Studio to see a slate of engagement metrics.</div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Classroom now available in additional languages</h3><p>With Classroom usage quickly growing around the world, we’re making it accessible to more learners in their native language. We’ll be launching Classroom in 10 additional Indian languages. Soon Classroom will support over 54 languages globally; with even more coming in the future.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>More support from partners</h3>With the new features in Google Classroom, you’ll also see that many apps are also launching new features that make their tools easy to use alongside Classroom. Explore these apps to learn how teachers and students can continue to stay organized, interactive, and collaborative with Classroom: <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/education/\">Canva</a>, <a href=\"https://nearpod.com/interactive-video\">Nearpod</a>, <a href=\"http://screencastify.com/education\">Screencastify</a>, <a href=\"https://achieve3000.com/\">Achieve3000</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adobeforeducation.com/k-12\">Adobe</a>, to name a few.</div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Classroom features coming soon</h3><p>In the coming month, we will provide a more detailed roadmap to help education leaders and teachers understand and prepare for other improvements that will launch to Classroom throughout the school year.  Here’s a sneak peek at some of the specific areas we’ll be working on:</p><ul><li><p>Student engagement metrics: Educators will be able to see stats that help track how students are interacting in Google Classroom each day.</p></li><li><p>Deeper integration with other teaching tools. With Classroom now playing a role as “mission control” for many classes, we'll enable more seamless integrations with the content and learning tools schools are using alongside Google’s tools.</p></li><li><p>Mobile offline improvements. We know that home and mobile internet connections aren’t always available or reliable, so we’re working to update the Classroom mobile apps to work much better even with intermittent connectivity.</p></li></ul>Integrated admin capabilities for deploying and managing Classroom. Provisioning classes for an entire school system can be time-consuming, especially given the scale of many of our customers. We’re building integrated tools to make it easier to create and manage courses at scale.<br/><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>If we can’t all physically be together in our schools this year, we’re committed to making Classroom and Meet even better to bring everyone together online. Please continue to share your feedback, and we’ll keep adapting our tools to meet your evolving needs.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/Zol1MEw1gSs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 18:45:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Polling_fqcX8Yn.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"f8dfe0f4c995e101bab9d9078d05bd13","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn3@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-23-51-494_31a1f7a825bc859b.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":562,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Polling_fqcX8Yn.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-23-52-291_31a1f7a825bc859b.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/To-Do-List-Improvements.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-24-18-766_58144c344484cecd.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Link-Based-Class-Joining-Share-Mobile.gif":null,"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/school_matches_7vu1UaV.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-23-52-285_8e045a72bcb3b06a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/Zol1MEw1gSs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn91@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-23-52-225_8f6b2334aaae5df8.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:23:49","title":"It's Music Week on Inside Guide","link":"https://blog.google/technology/developers/its-music-week-inside-guide/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>This summer is a weird one. The season known for long days, beaches and cross-country road trips has moved indoors, where a lot of us are spending more time hanging out at home with our families. In this alt-version of summer, people are searching for new ways to spend their time—and we’d like to help.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Since 2009, we’ve been building a series of small applications that test the limits of what’s possible using new web and mobile technologies. We call them “Experiments,” and we built them to challenge ourselves, inspire the broader developer community and help everyone have the chance to learn, investigate their universe and have a little fun.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We’ve decided to bring together some of our favorite experiments, games and activities in the newly-launched <a href=\"https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/insideguide\">Inside Guide</a>—which is organized by themes like Art, Nature, Culture and this week’s focus, Music. You can explore how music works with the <a href=\"https://g.co/musiclab\">Chrome Music Lab</a>. Then take it to the next level and make music just by moving your body with <a href=\"https://experiments.withgoogle.com/body-synth\">Body Synth</a>, or invite your friends to play live music with you on the web with the <a href=\"https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Shared-Piano/#T69C_4Ngh\">Shared Piano</a>—one of our favorites.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><a href=\"https://g.co/sharedpiano\">Shared Piano</a> is a new tool for remote music teaching and collaboration that lets you play together live. You can play on MIDI or computer keyboards with up to 10 people at once. You don’t need to login or install anything. Just send a link and start playing together. We’ve gotten great feedback from music teachers and friends using it to play music together, and we hope to continue evolving it based on feedback.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>In the coming weeks we’ll be highlighting more experiments as well as a few ideas on how to use them.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Play word guessing games with the machine</h3><a href=\"https://g.co/quickdraw\">Quick Draw</a> is an experiment where you are given a word like “snowflake,” “swan” or “bear” and asked to sketch it. A neural network powered by machine learning will then try to guess what you’re drawing. Think Pictionary on game night if one of your friends was a computer. Of course, it doesn’t always work. But the more you play with it, the more it will learn.</div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Text like an (ancient) Egyptian</h3>For centuries, from epigraphy pioneer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Fabricius\">Georg Fabricius</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv6tuzHUuuk\">The Bangles</a>, hieroglyphics have prodded our curiosity. We thought we’d take a swing at decoding them. Check out <a href=\"https://experiments.withgoogle.com/fabricius\">Fabricius</a>, a new Lab Experiment from Google Arts &amp; Culture that uses machine learning to help experts decode the stories of ancient Egypt. Today, you can use this technology to send your friends coded messages in hieroglyphs, the emojis of ancient Egypt.</div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Take a virtual vacation to Mars</h3><p>The Curiosity rover landed on Mars on August 5, 2012, and today you can take that trip through an immersive web experience called <a href=\"https://experiments.withgoogle.com/access-mars\">Access Mars</a>. Access Mars features some of the most important locations from the mission, key points of interest, and narration from NASA JPL Mission Scientist Katie Stack. Start exploring Mars today.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>These are just a few of the experiments, activities and games you’ll find in the Inside Guide.
