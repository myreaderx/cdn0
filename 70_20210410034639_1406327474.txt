The manual focus lens features apochromatic correction, which is unusual for a super telephoto lens. In total, the lens has 10 elements across 8 groups. It's a heavy, large lens. It weighs 13 lbs (5.9kg) and is 1.2' (36.6cm) in length. The lens has a built-in telescoping lens hood and is as you can see, includes a tripod foot.

The APO-Telyt-R Module lenses are all manual focus and were designed for Leica-R SLR cameras. What sets the lenses apart is that the APO-Telyt system is modular. In total, there are three focusing units and two heads available, which can be combined to create different focal length and aperture combinations. In total, the lenses you can configure are: 280mm F2.8, 400mm F2.8, 400mm F4, 560mm F4, 560mm F5.6 and 800mm F5.6. In addition to the modular lenses, Leica also made Leica Focus Modules in 1x, 1.4x and 2x options, which act as teleconverters.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7628559613/leica-apo-telyt-r-module-system.jpeg\" target=\"article-0fef6d40f57047cf9f41399db6af046e\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7628559613/leica-apo-telyt-r-module-system.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"leica-apo-telyt-r-module-system.jpeg\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">The Leica APO-Telyt-R Module System.
