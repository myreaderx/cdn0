We know meetings are the main entry point for teams to share and shape ideas into action. That’s why we recently introduced <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/\">Hangouts Meet</a>, an evolution of Google Hangouts designed specifically for the workplace, and <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/products/jamboard/\">Jamboard</a>, a way to bring creative brainstorming directly into meetings. Combined with Calendar and Drive, these tools extend collaboration <i>beyond</i> four walls and transform how we work—so every team member has a voice, no matter location.</p>\n  <p>But the transformative power of video meetings is wasted if it’s not affordable and accessible to all organizations. So today, we’re introducing Hangouts Meet hardware—a new way to bring high-quality video meetings to businesses of any size. We’re also announcing new software updates designed to make your meetings even more productive.</p>\n  <h2>Introducing Hangouts Meet hardware</h2>\n  <p>Hangouts Meet hardware is a cost-effective way to bring high-quality video meetings to your business. The hardware kit consists of four components: a touchscreen controller, speakermic, 4K sensor camera and ASUS Chromebox.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-medium \">\n     <img alt=\"Hangouts Meet controller\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/hangoutsmeetcontroller34jpg.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <p>The new controller provides a modern, intuitive touchscreen interface that allows people to easily join scheduled events from Calendar or view meeting details with a single tap. You can pin and mute team members, as well as control the camera, making managing meetings easy. You can also add participants with the dial-a-phone feature and present from a laptop via HDMI. If you’re a G Suite Enterprise edition customer, you can record the meeting to Drive.</p>\n     <p>Designed by Google, the Hangouts Meet speakermic actively eliminates echo and background noise to provide crisp, clear audio. Up to five speakermics can be daisy-chained together with a single wire, providing coverage for larger rooms without tabletop clutter.</p>\n     <p>The 4K sensor camera with 120° field of view easily captures everyone at the table, even in small spaces that some cameras find challenging. Each camera component is fine-tuned to make meetings more personal and distraction-free. Built with machine learning, the camera can intelligently detect participants and automatically crop and zoom to frame them.</p>\n     <p>Powered by Chrome OS, the ASUS Chromebox makes deploying and managing Hangouts Meet hardware easier than ever. The Chromebox can automatically push updates to other components in the hardware kit, making it easier for large organizations to ensure security and reliability. Remote device monitoring and management make it easy for IT administrators to stay in control, too.</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\">\n <div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\">\n  <section class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n    <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\">\n     <q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">New Hangouts Meet enhancements greatly improve user experience and simplify our meeting rooms.

We’ve heard feedback that the connection between these services is confusing, so next month, we’re making some changes to simplify the experience across Drive and Photos.</p>\n  <p><b>Changes to automatic sync between Google Drive and Google Photos</b></p>\n  <p>Starting in July, new photos and videos from Drive won’t automatically show in Photos. Similarly, new photos and videos in Photos will not be added to the Photos folder in Drive. Photos and videos you delete in Drive will not be removed from Photos. Similarly, items you delete in Photos will not be removed from Drive. This change is designed to help prevent accidental deletion of items across products.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;<b>New “Upload from Drive” feature in Google Photos</b></p>\n  <p>We’ve heard that many of you would like more granular control when copying photos and videos from Drive into Photos. So we’re bringing a new feature to <a href=\"http://photos.google.com\">photos.google.com</a> called “Upload from Drive,” which lets you manually choose photos and videos from Drive, including “Shared with Me” items, to import into Photos. Once copied, these items are not connected between the two products. Since photos and videos will no longer sync across both products, items copied in Original Quality will count towards your storage quota in both Drive and Photos.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;<b>Backup and Sync for Windows and Mac will continue to work</b></p>\n  <p>You’ll still be able to use <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/apps\">Backup and Sync</a> on Windows or macOS to upload to both services in High Quality or Original Quality. As before, items uploaded in High Quality won’t count against your account storage quota, and items uploaded using Backup and Sync in Original Quality to both services will count only once towards your quota.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;<b>Your existing photos and videos will stay in Google Drive and Google Photos</b></p>\n  <p>Any photos or videos from Drive in Photos that you have uploaded prior to this change will remain in Photos. If you have a “Google Photos” folder in Drive, it will remain in Drive, but will no longer update automatically.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;Our goal with these changes is to simplify some features that caused confusion for our users, based on feedback and our own research. We’ll continue to look for more ways to help support Drive and Photos users going forward.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;If you want to take a closer look at these new changes, please check out our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/9316089?p=blogpost_transitionarticle&amp;visit_id=636957989726780274-3529170745&amp;rd=1\">guide</a>.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":11006,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f4e11a1a64e581b263105cd469d0c971","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleDriveBlog/~4/ABaDGc5vDrA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn48@2020_1/2020/08/25/01-12-06-237_47a8419d59599136.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317898721},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:11:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:11:38","title":"Tips from the people behind your favorite Google products","link":"https://blog.google/products/search/tips-people-behind-your-favorite-google-products/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>I’m one of those people who always cuts it close at the airport—it’s a race through security, with just enough time to grab the airline essentials: water bottle, magazine, a soft pretzel if I’m lucky.

Set up an onboarding checklist, save to Team Drives</h2>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-medium \">\n     <img alt=\"Google Keep work hacks\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/workhacks_blog.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <p>To help new employees get up-to-speed quickly, create centralized resources like an onboard checklist or company backgrounder in <a href=\"https://goo.gl/dVwwof\">Google Keep</a> or <a href=\"https://goo.gl/28GfVf\">Docs</a>.</p>\n     <p>Your new team member can track to-dos by listing out key tasks in Keep. Create a note in Keep and select “Show checkboxes” in the three dots menu. Type in to-dos like “set up HR benefits,” “outline goals” or “meet with Anish about process.”</p>\n     <p>Pro-tip: Keep integrates directly into Docs. If you’re in Keep, pick a specific note, click the three dots menu and select “Copy to Google Doc.” Or if you’re in Docs, drag-and-drop your note over from Keep.</p>\n     <p>You can also prepare a more detailed company background for your teammate in Docs. List upcoming projects, assign action items or include other reference material like key contacts. Once you’ve created these resources, be sure to save them to your <a href=\"https://goo.gl/GoxZ6S\">Team Drives</a> so that the “newbie” knows where to find or upload files for team use.</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h2>2. Create an onboarding portal with Google Sites</h2>\n  <br />\n  <p>Now that you’ve created individual resources for an employee, create a mini-onboarding portal in <a href=\"https://goo.gl/6EbWg2\">Sites</a> to house them. What’s great about Sites is that you don’t have to be handy with code to build a website—you can spin one up quickly without design, programming or IT resources. Sites also syncs with your favorite G Suite apps, like <a href=\"https://goo.gl/GZTXYs\">Drive</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/5hRUwN\">Calendar</a>.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Sites GIF\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/GSuite_Workhacks_TrainingHub_gif_r1_1_1.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h2>3. Request access to IT systems and equipment using Forms</h2>\n  <p>Sometimes it can take a while to get access to the tools we need to do our jobs, but G Suite apps can help you get around the lag.

Fast forward to today and companies are being replaced approximately every two weeks. In this rapidly changing market, traditional companies are looking for ways to stay competitive and more and more enterprises, including Nielsen, Colgate and Airbus, are turning to G Suite to help them reimagine how they work to keep pace.</p>\n  <p>We know that enterprises want to move to cloud-first collaboration to transform how they work, but, understandably, they have questions about how to make it work in a business of their size. What happens with email security? How can they manage their data? How does G Suite work with the tools and systems they already have in place?</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/work-reimagined-new-ways-to-collaborate-safer-smarter-and-simpler-with-g-suite\">we announced</a> new products to help businesses reimagine how they work, and today we’re sharing additional solutions we’ve built to address these concerns.</p>\n  <p>Here’s a snapshot of what we’re announcing today. Read on for more detail.</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li><p>New Gmail (Redesigned security warnings, Snooze, Offline Access and more generally available for G Suite users)</p></li>\n   <li><p>Cloud Search (being deployed by an initial set of customers)</p></li>\n   <li><p>Google Voice for G Suite (available in our Early Adopter Program*)</p></li>\n   <li><p>Drive Enterprise Sku (available for purchase)</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>Keeping businesses (and emails) secure</h3>\n  <p>Keeping your data secure is our top priority, which is why we use machine learning to analyze threat indicators across billions of messages in Gmail to help quickly identify potential security attacks in the making. Machine learning helps protect more than 1.4 billion active Gmail user accounts from nearly 10 million spam and malicious emails every minute.</p>\n  <p>Today, <b>we’re making the new Gmail generally available to G Suite customers</b> so that, in addition to these baked-in security features, more companies can take advantage of features like redesigned security warnings, snooze, offline access and more. You can learn more <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/07/new-gmail-ga.html\">in this post</a>.</p>\n  <h3>Bringing the best of Google Search to enterprise data</h3>\n  <p>Searching through your company’s data should be as easy as doing a web search. But the reality is most companies’ information is spread across different silos and systems that don’t talk to each other, which makes finding things a lengthy chore. We <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/introducing-google-cloud-search-g-suite/\">introduced Cloud Search</a> last year to make it easy to find information across G Suite in a way that’s intuitive and assistive. Today, we are announcing <b>new Cloud Search functionality to help companies intelligently and securely index their third-party data beyond G Suite</b>, whether that data is stored in the cloud, or on-prem.</p>\n  <p>Companies, like Whirlpool Corporation, have started deploying Cloud Search’s new capabilities to unify search across multiple data sources. Using Cloud Search’s new SDKs, APIs and connectors for third-party connectivity, Whirlpool created a custom app called Whirlpool SearchPro that indexes more than 12 million documents across different on-prem and cloud systems and returns results in 100s of milliseconds on average. Moreover, search results reflect the specific permissions and access controls from each of the source systems to ensure that individuals only see the information they should.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Whirlpool Cloud Search - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Whirlpool-cloud-search-1280x720_PVn7Rir.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Cloud Search’s new functionality will be available to G Suite Enterprise customers as well as &nbsp;any company looking to power their enterprise search needs as a new standalone offering.

Aside from bringing the best of video conferencing to businesses, we also want to create better telephony solutions so that employees can be more productive over the phone. For close to a decade, millions of consumers have used Google Voice to connect with folks across the globe. <b>Now we’re bringing an enterprise version of Voice to G Suite</b>.</p>\n  <p>On top of the existing features that users love, Google Voice is tightly integrated with G Suite apps, like Hangouts Meet and Google Calendar, and provides administrator capabilities best suited for the enterprise. Admins can manage users, provision and port phone numbers, access detailed reports and set up call routing functionality. Voice also lets you deploy phone numbers to employees, or even entire departments, at once, and assigns a &nbsp;number that’s not tied to a specific device. AI-powered features in Voice also help facilitate voicemail transcription and spam filtering, which helps eliminate disruptions for employees so they can focus on what’s important.<br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\">\n <div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\">\n  <section class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n    <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\">\n     <q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">Google Voice quickly emerged as our preferred telephony solution for remote teams and frequent travelers.</q> \n     <cite class=\"uni-pull-quote__author\"><span class=\"uni-pull-quote__author-meta\"><strong class=\"h-u-font-weight-medium\">Kim Anstett</strong><br /> Chief Information Officer, Nielsen</span></cite>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>We’ve been testing this enterprise version with key customers since last October.

Enterprises are drowning in files, and there’s an immense opportunity to harness that information. Those files represent a company’s collective knowledge—every strategic plan, brainstorming note and financial plan—and with Drive, we’re giving businesses a way to find, organize, understand and act on that knowledge.</p>\n  <p>Today, we are excited to announce that we are being recognized for our progress on this journey. Google has been named a leader in the <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/campaigns/gartner-magic-quadrant/\">Gartner Magic Quadrant for Content Collaboration Platforms (CCP)</a>.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"Customer image\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google-Drive.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>More companies are embracing cloud solutions like Drive because of the opportunity they pose: when you make content accessible from any device, anywhere, at anytime, teams can collaborate more and become more nimble. This new way of working provides tremendous opportunity to improve productivity and innovation, but it can also increase complexity.</p>\n  <p>As an international clothing manufacturer and retailer, GANT is familiar with the challenges of running a global brand. The company employs an international creative team to create its smart, practical and stylish clothing items and requires collaboration solutions that bring their work from sketchbook to store. Says Matthew Wood, creative director at GANT, \"Google Drive is a very visual and simple way of working. We can plan, manage and discuss our work in progress within one place—fabrics, styles, everything, right down to the very last stitch.\"</p>\n  <p>We listened carefully to enterprise customers like GANT and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/introducing-new-enterprise-ready-tools-google-drive/\">we launched several new capabilities in Drive</a> to address these new complexities. Some challenges we heard from customers like Sanmina, Whirlpool or Woolworth’s included:</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li><i>Help my teams work confidently in the cloud.</i> To make it easier for teams of all sizes to collaborate seamlessly in the cloud, we’ve added features like Team Drives. In Team Drives, you can easily view, access and control content sharing because it’s owned collectively by your team and organized in one place. <br /></li>\n   <li><i>Give us the tools to find the information we need to get work done fast.</i> When you’re in the middle of a project, the last thing you want to do is dig for information you need to complete it. Instead, use Quick Access in Drive to surface the files you need. Quick Access uses Google’s advanced artificial intelligence to find and suggest the most important files based on a number of work signals and patterns—saving 50 percent of the time you would spend searching for content. Less time digging means more time working on important tasks.<br /></li>\n   <li><i>Help our admins maintain the visibility and control they need.</i> It’s important to be in control of your company data, especially as you transition to the cloud.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/vault/answer/2462480?hl=en&amp;visit_id=1-636354890571535079-629150902&amp;rd=1\">Vault</a>, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/6321530?hl=en\">Data Loss Prevention for Drive</a> and <a href=\"https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/new-google-drive-metrics-now-accessible.html\">many auditing enhancements</a>&nbsp;make it easier for admins to meet data retention/compliance needs and prevent data breaches, like accidentally sharing a file with SSNs outside of your company.</li>\n   <li><i>Make migrating from on-prem to the cloud easier for my business.</i> You can’t afford to have work come to a standstill because of a botched migration or because new solutions aren’t compatible with existing tools. To help you migrate from on-prem, cloud or hybrid solutions, we recently integrated <a href=\"https://www.appbridge.io/\">AppBridge</a>, a leading enterprise-grade migration provider, into G Suite. After migration, you can use the new <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/campaigns/index__drive-fs-eap.html\">Drive File Stream</a> to access all of your content in Drive from your computer without syncing delays or filling up your employees’ hard drives.<br /></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/contact-form/\">Get in touch with Google</a> to learn more about how your business can benefit from moving to the cloud.</p>\n  <p><i>Note: Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.

Beyond being frustrating, this can cause confusion and slow down your project. One of the great things about working in cloud-native tools like <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/products/docs/\">G Suite</a> is that everything is automatically saved. You never have to worry if you’re working on the most up-to-date version of a document because your apps do that for you.</p>\n  <p>But for the times that you need to go back and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">see changes</a>, it’s simple. Go to <b>File &gt; Version history &gt; See version</b> history and view a complete list of changes to your document in one place. You can restore previous versions of a document there, too.</p>\n  <p>Another trick is to simply click the text at the top of your navigation bar that says “last edit was…” or “all changes saved” in Google Docs. If you hover over that text, it will actually tell you what the last change to the document was and who made it. Or if you’re returning to a document, you can click “See new changes” and the Doc will highlight edits that have been made since your last visit.</p>\n  <p>Read on for more tips on how to keep track of work in G Suite.</p>\n  <h3><b>Take it a step further</b></h3>\n  <p>Beyond viewing versions, there are other cool things you can do to keep track of work in G Suite. You can:</p>\n  <p><b>1. Make copies of specific versions</b>.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>This is great for sharing “before” and “after” versions of your work with your boss. You can make copies of specific versions within version history. Click the three dot icon next to your selected version and choose “make a copy” to have a second record.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"make copies.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/make_copies.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>2. Name specific versions of your work.</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>In version history, you can keep track of your work by naming individual versions in your list. Because all of your changes are saved in the cloud, it’s easy to go back and change version names instead of having ten different versions of a “Final” document floating in email threads. Bonus points for creative names!</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"name specific versions.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/name_specific_versions.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>3. See who’s viewed your work and when.</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>If you’ve ever wondered who specifically has looked at your work, there’s a way for you to view activity within Google Docs, Sheets or Slides. Those folks who use paid versions can go to <b>Tools &gt; Activity</b> dashboard and see detail about the number of people reviewing their document, who specifically has reviewed and viewership trends. If you want to get there quicker, you can use this keyboard shortcut to see the activity dashboard: Ctrl + Alt/Option + T, then click Z.</p>\n  <p><b>4. Set up notifications to see when changes are made in Sheets.</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>If you’re working in a spreadsheet to track a project, you may want to see regular updates for when changes are made. You can set up notifications to alert you of changes immediately after someone changes data in a cell.

Since then, we've heard one request from teachers loud and clear: students need to be able to access their experiments no matter what device they're using or where they are. Learning doesn't just happen in the classroom, it happens outdoors, at home and everywhere in between. So today, we’re bringing a new Google Drive syncing feature to Science Journal. Now, you can access your experiments on any device using a Google Account.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Drive Sync with Science Journal\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/DriveSync_Blog_portraitcropped.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Accessing your experiment from Google Drive is easy: you can sign in with any Google Account and all of your experiments will be backed up to a Science Journal folder in Google Drive. If you have existing experiments on your device, you can add them to your Google Drive account. Many viewing, sharing and collaboration features will be coming to Science Journal in the future.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>If you don't have a Google Account or you don't want to sign in, you can still use Science Journal—but your data won't be saved to Google Drive. If your school doesn't have Google Accounts, you can <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/signup/edu/welcome#0\">sign up for G Suite for free</a>—just remember that G Suite for Education accounts need a domain administrator to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/6242933\">activate Science Journal</a> in the G Suite Admin console.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>In addition to today’s syncing feature, we have a lot of new resources in Science Journal, just for teachers. Check out the new <a href=\"https://teachercenter.withgoogle.com/fundamentals/unit?unit=56&amp;lesson=94\">fundamentals</a> and <a href=\"https://teachercenter.withgoogle.com/advanced_training/unit?unit=44&amp;lesson=76\">advanced</a> professional development modules in the Google for Education Teacher Center. For introductory science activities, head over to <a href=\"http://www.scholastic.com/scienceaction/\">Scholastic's Science in Action</a> initiative, and for more hands-on physics content, you can pre-order <a href=\"https://store.arduino.cc/usa/physics-lab\">Arduino's Science Kit</a>. If you're looking for new ways to enhance Science Journal's capabilities, check out <a href=\"https://www.vernier.com/products/software/science-journal/\">Vernier's Go Direct</a> line of classroom sensors. Science Journal activities can now be found on the <a href=\"https://edu.workbencheducation.com/partners/science-journal\">Workbench</a> site, and you can always find activities and more on the <a href=\"http://g.co/sciencejournal\">Science Journal website</a> and get support in our new <a href=\"https://support.google.com/sciencejournal\">help center</a>. Finally, the Science Journal iOS app is <a href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/03/open-sourcing-science-journal-ios.html\">now open source</a>, so the app's code is available to the public, making it a great opportunity for students, hobbyists and companies who want to see how Science Journal works and even contribute code back to us.</p>\n  <br />Our goal with Science Journal is to help you enhance scientific thinking and data literacy in your classroom.

In a nutshell, G Suite companies can now use advanced configurations to help fend off phishing scams. These updates will continue to help businesses block (ph)ishy activity, like if an untrusted sender tries to share encrypted attachments or if someone tries to trick you by sending information from a domain that looks like yours.</p>\n  <p>With these protections in place, more than 99.9 percent of Business Email Compromise (BEC) scenarios—when someone impersonates an executive to get sensitive information—are automatically moved to spam or flagged to users as shifty. Sorry, Charlie.</p>\n  <p>We also automatically enabled basic device management for mobile devices that access G Suite. Now IT admins can better enforce pass codes, erase confidential data for Android and iOS devices with selective account wipe <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/helping-g-suite-customers-stay-secure-new-proactive-phishing-protections-and-management-controls/\">and more</a> without users needing to install profiles.

You can easily jot down ideas or share to-dos with co-workers. We asked Mario Anima, product manager for Google Keep, to share some of his favorite Keep tips. This is what we learned.</p>\n  <h3>1. Record voice notes.</h3>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>For recording thoughts on the go, you can record voice memos within Google Keep on your Android or iOS device. Open up the Keep mobile app, click on the microphone icon at the bottom right of your screen and record your message. When you’re done talking, the recording will automatically end and a new screen will pop up with the text of your message and an audio file.</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <p></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"Record GIF\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Keep_Mobile_V03_VO2_1000x563.gif\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Click on “title” at the top of your audio file and name your note. Your note is automatically synced with the web app, too, so you can access it on your desktop.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3></h3>\n  <h3>2. Transcribe notes from pictures.</h3>\n  <p>Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Keep can transcribe text from pictures for you, so you don’t have to worry about typing up notes from a meeting or whiteboard session (shameless plug: you can also use <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/lets-jam-jamboard-now-available/\">Jamboard</a>for that).</p>\n  <p>Just take a photo, select “Grab Image Text” &nbsp;and Keep will transcribe your note.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"OCR gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Keep_Mobile_V02_1000x563.gif\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>3. Create drawings and even search handwritten notes.</h3>\n  <p>You can sketch images in Keep. Select the pen icon at the bottom of your mobile screen and a bunch of options will appear. Play with colors, shades and more. Once you’re finished with your drawing, you can share it right away with coworkers. Or, you can come back to handwritten memos later by searching for what you wrote.</p>\n  <p>Speaking of search, you can also find images by searching for words contained within them. Say you snap a photo from a whiteboard and the image contains the word “Proposal.” Just search Keep for “proposal” and your image will appear.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>4. Drag and drop notes from Keep into Google Docs.</h3>\n  <p>Now you can use Keep directly within Docs—take notes you’ve created in Keep and drag them into client proposals and more.</p>\n  <p>If you’re in a Doc: click “Tools” on the menu bar, and then “Keep Notepad.” A sidebar will pop up with all of your note options. You can scroll through the list or use the search bar to jump right to the note you need. Once you’ve found it, drag-and-drop the note into your doc.</p>\n  <p>If you’re in the Keep app: select the note you want to send, click the three dots menu and click “Copy to Google Doc.”</p>\n  <p>You can also create notes in the Keep notepad while viewing a Doc. One bonus is that when you create a note in Docs, Keep creates a source backlink—so you can access the note in Keep and it will link back to the source document where the note was created.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"Keep GIF\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/keep-docs.gif\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>5.

One cool thing is that when you create a note using the extension, it saves the site URL with it.

Send notes from Keep to other apps you use.</h3>\n  <p>Some teams save content from other messaging or social media apps in Keep to reference later. Or, vice versa, you might use Keep to draft emails or social media posts on-the-go. Click on the three dots in the bottom right corner of your Keep app, select “send” and choose the app you want to share your note with.</p>\n  <h3>7. Color-code or label your notes to find them quicker.</h3>\n  <p>To organize your notes by color-coding them in Keep, at the bottom of a Keep note, select the three dots menu and choose from several colors to help you quickly identify a note. You might consider color-coding by task or deadline. If you’re working on your desktop, you can also use the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/category-tabs-for-google/dlahcjmefibiedeecoegjilekaebchhl\">Category Tabs for Google Keep Extension in Chrome</a> to assign category names by color.

Another way to locate your information in Keep is to add and create labels using #hashtags. When you create a note in the Keep app, you can type #label-name and Keep will prompt you to either apply a label if it already exists, or create one if it doesn’t. It’s a pretty handy shortcut.</p>\n  <h3>8. Set reminders for yourself.</h3>\n  <p>Notes matter only if you can execute on what your record. Keep lets you set up reminders which can help.</p>\n  <p>Select a note and click the finger icon at the top right of your screen in Keep (it has a string on it). When you do that, a pop-up window will give you options to set reminders.

Students have to learn to navigate the line between other people’s ideas and their own, and how and when to properly cite sources.</p>\n  <p>We've heard from instructors that they copy and paste passages into Google Search to check if student work is authentic, which can be repetitive, inefficient and biased. They also often spend a lot of time giving feedback about missed citations and improper paraphrasing. By integrating the power of Search into our assignment and grading tools, we can make this quicker and easier.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>That’s why Google is introducing <a href=\"http://edu.google.com/products/originality\">originality reports</a>. This new feature—with several reports included free in every course—will be part of <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/products/classroom/?modal_active=none\">Classroom</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/introducing-assignments\">Assignments</a>, which was also announced today. We create originality reports by scanning student work for matched phrases across hundreds of billions of web pages and tens of millions of books.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>When assigning work in Classroom and Assignments, instructors will have the option to enable originality reports. Students will then be able to run up to three originality reports on documents they attach to the assignment before submitting their work. This heads-up gives students an opportunity to proactively improve their work, and also saves time for instructors.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>After submission, a fresh originality report will automatically be available to instructors when grading the assignment. These reports will flag text that has missed citations and has high similarity with text on the web or in books.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Analyze student work with originality reports in Google Assignments\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Analyze_social_1.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>But comparing work to search results isn’t the only way to ensure authentic work. Coming soon, schools can choose to have their own private repository of past student submissions, so instructors can receive originality reports that include student-to-student matches within the same school.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Once the feature is generally available, instructors will be able to access originality reports at no charge for up to three assignments in each course they teach. Schools that would like unlimited access can upgrade their instructors to <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/products/gsuite-for-education/enterprise/?modal_active=none\">G Suite Enterprise for Education</a>.&nbsp; During the initial, limited testing period, all instructors can use originality reports as much as they would like to, at no charge. We’ll continue to add features at no additional cost to G Suite for Education. <br /></p>\n  <p>To use originality reports with Classroom, sign up to apply to be part of the testing program by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflQoXEBjFx9WMglISWJMY8FS0Ml41kFTmDrfvBs9eqF4kxnQ/viewform\">filling out our form</a>. To try Assignments, which includes originality reports automatically, <a href=\"http://edu.google.com/assignments\">sign up through our website</a>.</p>\n  <p>We’re looking forward to seeing how teachers and students alike use the tool to create work that’s both authentic and original.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":11006,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Analyze_social_1.gif","linkMd5":"0a46861a41f0a16bf3f1ab73fe778717","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-11-45-996_10cf259801cf5fdb.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":6237577,"destBytes":3522100,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Analyze_social_1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_2/2020/08/25/01-11-45-996_10cf259801cf5fdb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleDriveBlog/~4/X95NhHglhQs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/25/01-12-06-194_9db0f8406340a2d1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317898721},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:11:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:11:38","title":"Protecting our Google Docs and Drive Users","link":"https://blog.google/products/docs/protecting-our-google-docs-and-drive-users/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Protecting all Google users from viruses, malware, and other abusive content is central to user cyber-safety and sometimes we remove access to certain files in order to provide these protections.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>On Tuesday, October 31, we mistakenly blocked access to some of our users’ files, including Google Docs.

As Avi Couillard, a Senior Strategist at the digital agency <a href=\"http://www.instrument.com/\">Instrument</a>, puts it: “Some people need to noodle on an idea, some need to converse with their team about it, and some need to visit it on their own terms.” For agencies like Instrument, inspiration can strike at any place and time.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Instrument’s creative team has been using <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/lets-jam-jamboard-now-available/\">Jamboard</a> for 10 months as a part of early testing cycles to facilitate brainstorms and execute on big ideas for clients, including Google.

His colleague, UX Illustrator Sheri Smith, jokes: “That handwriting was usually mine.”</p>\n  <p>They’d leave meetings with a ton of ideas that were then assigned to other designers, illustrators or animators to interpret. “It was time-consuming and the process sometimes diluted creativity,” says Avi.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"Jamboard and Instrument team\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/TW5A8953-Edit.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Now, instead of deciphering half-formulated ideas after the fact, Sheri visualizes concepts right away by sketching them on Jamboard as they’re mentioned. Avi and Sheri also bring remote colleagues into a brainstorm session. Other designers or programmers can join meetings via Hangout within the Jamboard, have PDF versions of work sent to them, or view “jams” from their phone, tablet or computer and rev on a concept right away.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\">\n <div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\">\n  <section class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n    <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\">\n     <q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">Jamboard helps us focus more on the ideas, and less on translating creative direction to different teams.</q> \n     <cite class=\"uni-pull-quote__author\"><span class=\"uni-pull-quote__author-meta\"><strong class=\"h-u-font-weight-medium\">Avi Couillard</strong><br /> Senior Strategist, Instrument</span></cite>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>“Jamboard helps us focus more on the ideas, and less on translating or assigning creative direction to different teams,” says Avi. His team is able to keep working on ideas after meetings wrap, too. “Because ideas from ‘jams’ are saved in Drive, they’re captured in their original form for everyone on the team. This provides the whole team with access so they can keep adding to them to make them better.” Once the work is complete, the team adds the final output into a <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/slides/\">Slides</a> presentation to share with internal teams or clients to review.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>Ideas from everywhere, everyone</h3>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>With Jamboard, more team members are involved in the creative process earlier, including those who may not be viewed as traditional “creatives.” Says Andrew Barden, Senior Producer: “Jamboard democratizes brainstorms. Sometimes it’s easy to think ‘oh, I’m not a creative,’ but that’s not true. Ideas come from everywhere, and being able to iterate early in the process helps you produce your best work.”</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\">\n <div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\">\n  <section class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n    <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\">\n     <q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">Jamboard democratizes brainstorms.

Instead of a “grand unveil” of a polished product, other business units or your clients become broader extensions of your creative team. If you involve more team members in the thinking early on, they’re more likely to be invested in the end result. “Using Jamboard, I’ve had to get more comfortable with sharing my rough sketches or unfinished work to clients early on,” says Sheri. “But they like that. It’s like if you buy a painting that you watched someone paint. That’s more valuable to you than buying it off the shelf.”</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\">\n <div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\">\n  <section class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n    <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\">\n     <q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">It’s like if you buy a painting that you watched someone paint.
