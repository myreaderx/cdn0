This is our favorite paid VPN for providing speed, reliability, and outstanding customer service. It's not the most affordable option though it's still a great value. If you're looking for the best of the best, ExpressVPN is it.</p> \n         <!-- END RECO-BLOCK MINI --> \n        </div> \n        <h2>What should I look for in a cheap monthly VPN plan?</h2> \n        <p>In terms of prioritization, a low monthly price that's paid monthly is top of the list, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice power, privacy, and ease of use for that. Most of the best VPN services have monthly payment options and the service is exactly the same.</p> \n        <p>We listed IPVanish as the best cheap VPN monthly plan is it is currently discounting its 1-month offering by 50% which means you can try out its fully-featured VPN offering without spending a ton of cash or committing for a year or more to get a deal.</p> \n        <p>That being said, our top overall VPN service, ExpressVPN, also makes this list despite being on the more expensive end. Even at its full $12.95 month-to-month cost, it doesn't exactly cost a fortune so you can get set up with the best VPN on the market on a no-commitment basis.</p> \n        <h2>Why are monthly VPNs more expensive?</h2> \n        <p>With most service-based offerings, the longer you commit, the less it costs on a monthly equivalent basis. The simple explanation for this is that companies would rather you put down more money upfront, have you committed to them for a longer-term, to avoid losing you as a customer to a rival.</p> \n        <p>In order to lure you in, they offer discounts on longer-term subscriptions. That being said, you can usually try the service out for a month to see if you like, make use of a free version or trial, or even use a money-back guarantee to get a refund if you need to, so there's little risk with signing up.</p> \n        <h2>Should I try a free VPN before paying?</h2> \n        <p>Free versions of VPNs are useful for a few reasons, but in the context of this article, the main benefit is being able to try out a VPN without spending anything at all. You'll get a feel for the service, the apps, the customer support, and more, and it can help you decide which VPN to go for in the long term.</p> \n        <p>However, it's worth bearing in mind that the vast majority of free VPN plans have some kind of limit imposed in order to incentivize you to upgrade to a paid plan. These may make it impossible to use for your needs, for example, a small data limit will soon run out if you want to stream Netflix.</p>\n       </hr>\n      </hr>\n     </hr>\n    </hr>\n   </hr>\n
