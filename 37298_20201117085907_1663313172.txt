I am finally REVEALING the main reason why I haven't been on my blog much. \n<br />For those of you who've been with me since the beginning in 2006 - and remember \n<a href=\"http://madebygirl.blogspot.com/2006/11/jen-says-hello.html\"><b>my first post </b></a>...it may seem odd that I've been taking such a BIG break from blogging!&nbsp; But like everything else in life, this too gets a bit boring.&nbsp; Sometimes we just need a break, a refresher.... to re-think what else we'd like to try &amp; hopefully accomplish in our lives.&nbsp; So, here's a small look into what I've been working on lately. \n<br />\n<br />Ever since Noah popped into the mix - I've been thinking more &amp; more about clothing for KIDS.&nbsp; I LOVE TO CREATE.&nbsp; I love painting, drawing, designing &amp; coming up with new ideas &amp; concepts. In fact, both of my businesses were about ART that I created for people's homes.&nbsp; So, after contemplating this for quite some time,&nbsp; I decided to try my hand at a market that is completely saturated &amp; competitive.&nbsp; I'm talking about\n<i> kids apparel.</i>&nbsp; \n<br />\n<br />Trust me, I realize I am taking a BIG risk in jumping into an industry that is already full of wonderful talent. Even with the same hesitation &amp; fear many of you felt at first... I am ready &amp; here I come!\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/table-top-designs.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/table-top-designs.jpg\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />As I said, this is a NEW market for me.&nbsp; My head keeps going back &amp; forth between fear &amp; excitement.&nbsp; I had forgotten what this fear felt like after running my previous business, \n<a href=\"https://www.madebygirl.com/\"><b>Made By Girl </b></a>for over 10 years.&nbsp; Throughout that time, I remember many women emailing me &amp; asking how they could start their own businesses. They always wondered if they would be able to put aside their own fears &amp; introduce their business ideas to the world.&nbsp; I often wonder what many of those women ended up doing.&nbsp; Well, here I am, back at the 'starting line' with another adventure ready to be introduced.&nbsp; \n<br />\n<br />For me, this is yet another medium to express my art.&nbsp; I am super EXCITED about these hand-drawn designs for kids tees I created.&nbsp; I really think other moms will love them too!&nbsp; The t-shirts are all screen-printed &amp; we will be launching ONLY 8-10 designs to start! We will ACTUALLY be RE-branding the \n<a href=\"http://cocoaandhearts.com/\"><b>Cocoa &amp; Hearts</b></a> website &amp; launching it into this new brand. Hope it doesn't cause too much confusion! If you want to know the launch date + news updates -&nbsp; feel free to sign up to the newsletter \n<a href=\"http://cocoaandhearts.com/\"><b>here</b></a>.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/noah-kid-gear.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/noah-kid-gear.jpg\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I hope you will welcome this NEW &amp; fun kids brand we are launching SOON - from one MAMA to another, THANK YOU in advance!!!!
