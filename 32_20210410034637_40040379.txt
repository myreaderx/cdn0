To the researchers, they indicate an extended period of ozone depletion in the Earth's atmosphere. (While terrestrial plants and insects weren't as decimated as sea organisms during the extinction, they were nonetheless subjected to whatever it was that happened.)</p><p>Fields says there's scant evidence of a local culprit such as volcanic activity. His team also ruled out dramatic events such as meteorites, solar storms, or gamma-ray bursts. As grad student co-author Jesse Miller explains, \"These events end quickly and are unlikely to cause the long-lasting ozone depletion that happened at the end of the Devonian period.\"</p><p>\"Instead,\" says Fields, \"we propose that one or more supernova explosions, about 65 light-years away from Earth, could have been responsible for the protracted loss of ozone.\"</p><p>Such a flash of light would be both spectacular to witness and deadly. The researchers say that a supernova would be capable of damaging the ozone layer for as long as 100,000 years. Such an event would constitute a \"one-two punch.\" It would begin with a barrage of destructive ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and gamma rays. This would be followed by a longer-term increase in cosmic rays striking the Earth as a result of blast debris colliding with surrounding gases and driving increased particle acceleration.</p><p>Considering that there was apparently a 300,000-year decline in biodiversity before the massive die-off, the team suggests that the Earth may even have been affected by a series of supernova explosions instead of just one.</p><p>\"This is entirely possible,\" says Miller. \"Massive stars usually occur in clusters with other massive stars, and other supernovae are likely to occur soon after the first explosion.\"</p><h2>A \"smoking gun\" for the supernova hypothesis</h2><p>The only way to verify the theory put forth by Fields' team would be to find a particular pair of radioactive isotopes—plutonium-244 and samarium-146—in the geologic record for the time frame in question.</p><p>Undergraduate co-author Zhenghai Liu explains, \"Neither of these isotopes occurs naturally on Earth today, and the only way they can get here is via cosmic explosions.\"</p><p>Fields compares locating such isotopes to finding green bananas: \"When you see green bananas in Illinois, you know they are fresh, and you know they did not grow here. Like bananas, Pu-244 and Sm-146 decay over time. So if we find these radioisotopes on Earth today, we know they are fresh and not from here—the green bananas of the isotope world—and thus the smoking guns of a nearby supernova.\"</p><p>The search for the isotopes has yet to begin.</p>Meanwhile, there's little reason to worry about future supernovae doing to us what those earlier ones may have done to the Earth's coral reefs, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uE49MV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">science fiction</a> notwithstanding. Says another co-author, grad student Adrienne Ertel, \"To put this into perspective, one of the closest supernova threats today is from the star Betelgeuse, which is over 600 light-years away.\"<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/x91-m2vmeIg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:05:30 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzNTE4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTYwNDAxNn0.SQqX61aScAVnLBidKirL5AiE0YR49PAqTrwgCjVfJRQ/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"17a668608a218042ba72bdd96be5833d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-19-754_e9bd761238c31d6d.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":15120,"destBytes":15120,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzNTE4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTYwNDAxNn0.SQqX61aScAVnLBidKirL5AiE0YR49PAqTrwgCjVfJRQ/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-19-754_e9bd761238c31d6d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/x91-m2vmeIg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-58-102_50390a9cbea354b2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026319309},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","title":"If you hate your job, blame the Agricultural Revolution","link":"https://bigthink.com/13-8/hate-job-blame-agricultural-revolution","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk1NTkyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3OTAyNTQxOX0.9OnNfFW5tzWvqIlG7womGgEBe1ACFPuFgOhC-HSQwRw/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C417&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"> <li>For the species <em>Homo sapiens</em>, the Agricultural Revolution was a good deal, allowing the population to grow and culture to advance.

Throughout most of those 300 millennia, human beings existed as bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers. It was only after the ice melted at the beginning of the current interglacial period (a geologic epoch called the Holocene) that we humans invented a new way of being human: farming. It was indeed a revolution, changing every aspect of being human, from how many people we might see in our lifetimes to how we spent those lifetimes.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution#/media/File:Maler_der_Grabkammer_des_Sennudem_001.jpg\"></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution#/media/File:Maler_der_Grabkammer_des_Sennudem_001.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"agricultural revolution\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8201685fcc18210529e64282086dc640\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk1NjEwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMTIxOTEwMn0.ffnA7fb9AJC_g0F2R1uiHOU9OuOCli8QF90nQMK1O5c/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1253\" id=\"ebdb2\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1919\"/></a>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Public Domain via Wikipedia</small></p><p>The usual way the Agricultural Revolution gets characterized is a glorious triumph. Consider this <a href=\"https://sciencing.com/benefits-agriculture-farmers-6973506.html\" target=\"_blank\">telling</a> of the tale.<br/></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Humans once subsisted by hunting and gathering, foraging for available food wherever it could be found. These early peoples necessarily moved frequently, as food sources changed, became scarce or moved in the case of animals. This left little time to pursue anything other than survival and a peripatetic lifestyle. Human society changed dramatically … when agriculture began… With a settled lifestyle, other pursuits flourished, essentially beginning modern civilization.</em><em></em></p><p>Hooray! Thanks to farming we could invent museums and concert halls and sports stadiums and then go visit them with all our free time.</p><p>The problem with this narrative, according to some writers and scholars like Jared Diamond and Yuval Noah Harari is that while the Agricultural Revolution may have been good for the species by turning surplus food into exponential population growth, it was terrible for individuals, that is, you and me. </p><h2>Hunter-gatherers worked about five hours per day</h2><p>Consider this. Anthropologist <a href=\"https://anthropology.uchicago.edu/people/emeritus-faculty/marshall-sahlins\" target=\"_blank\">Marshall Sahlins</a> once estimated that the average hunter-gatherer spent about five hours a day working at, well, hunting and gathering. That's because nature was actually pretty plentiful. It didn't take that long to gather what was needed. (Gathering was actually a much more important food source than hunting.) The rest of the day was probably spent hanging out and gossiping as people are wont to do. If nature locally stopped being abundant, the tribe just moved on. Also, hunter-gatherers appear to have lived in remarkably horizontal societies in terms of power and wealth. No one was super-rich and no one was super-poor. Goods were distributed relatively equally, which is why Sahlins called hunter-gatherers the \"original affluent society.\"</p><p>Stationary farmers, on the other hand, had to work long, backbreaking days. They literally had to tear up the ground to plant seeds and then tear it up again digging irrigation trenches that brought water to those seeds. And if it doesn't rain enough, everyone starves. If it rains too much, everyone starves. And on top of it all, the societies that emerge from farming end up being wildly hierarchical with all kinds of kings and emperors and dudes-on-top who somehow end up with the vast majority of surplus wealth generated by all the backbreaking, tearing-up-the-ground work.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat#/media/File:Woman_harvesting_wheat,_Raisen_district,_Madhya_Pradesh,_India_ggia_version.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"870f64375d181ac1ce3a5cfc122cc494\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk1NjE4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MDA1OTUxN30.VdefFdkexis7yH3mlXOd4kcTNpVVc-KgpE46GIzfntg/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1344\" id=\"a044a\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1920\"/></a>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">A woman harvesting wheat.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Yann\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"User:Yann\">Yann Forget</a> via Wikipedia</small></p><p><br/></p><h2>Did we domesticate wheat, or did wheat domesticate us?</h2><p>So how did this happen? How did the change occur, and why did anyone volunteer for the switch? One possibility is that it was a trap. </p><p>Historian Yuval Noah Harari sees human beings getting domesticated in a long process that closed doors behind it. During periods of good climate, some hunter-gatherers began staying near wild wheat outcroppings to harvest the cereal. Processing the grains inadvertently spread the plant around, producing more wheat next season. More wheat led to people staying longer each season. Eventually, seasonal camps became villages with granaries that led to surpluses, which in turn let people have a few more children. </p><p>So farming required far more work, but it allowed for more children. In good times, this cycle worked out fine and populations rose. But four or five generations later, the climate shifted a little, and now those hungry mouths require even more fields to be cleared and irrigation ditches to be dug. The reliance on a single food source, rather than multiple sources, also leaves more prone to famine and disease. But by the time anyone gets around to thinking, \"Maybe this farming thing was a bad idea,\" it's too late. There's no living memory of another way of life. The trap has been sprung. We had gotten caught by our own desire for the \"luxury\" of owning some surplus food. For some anthropologists like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/05/13/183710778/why-humans-took-up-farming-they-like-to-own-stuff\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Samual Bowles</a>, it was the idea of ownership itself that trapped us.</p><p>Of course, if you could ask the species <em>Homo sapiens</em> if this was a good deal, like the wild wheat plants of yore, the answer would be a definitive yes! So many more people. So much advancement in technology and so many peaks reached in culture. But for you and me as individuals, in terms of how we get to spend our days or our entire lives, maybe the answer is not so clear. Yes, I do love my modern medicine and video games and air travel. But living in a world of deep connections with nature and with others that included a lot of time not working for a boss, that sounds nice too. </p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p>So, what do you think?

Its main component is an acrylic sphere that sits above ground to absorb and concentrate sunlight. A plastic optical fibre is positioned under the sphere to collect and transport the concentrated sunlight to a desired location up to two stories underground.</p><p>To ensure the system collects the maximum amount of sunlight, a GPS device uses motors to move the fibre cable into optimal positions, depending on the position of the sun. This helps save energy, considering the only moving part is the lightweight cable, not the heavier sphere.</p><p>But what if it's cloudy? To solve that inevitable problem, the team outfitted the emitting end of the fibre cable with an electrically powered LED bulb that produces artificial light.

The system involved a weekly check-in where the participant listed the tasks they wanted to do and how long they expected them to take and report back a week later on how long those tasks actually took.</p><p>Perhaps by accident, this system took on the form of a longitudinal study, the sort of research that looks at a certain variable (in this case, task completion times) over a certain period of time.</p><p>The data included 559 tasks done over much of the last year, when they were completed, when they were expected to be completed, and how many working hours that represented. As explained in the paper, a task fit one of these categories:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">1. Coding: any coding task for research or schoolwork (e.g., analysis in Python).</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">2. Writing: any writing or editing-focused task (e.g., working on a paper draft).</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">3. Reading: any reading-focused task (e.g., reading a journal article).</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">4. Administrative: any task related to running a research group or department (e.g., organizing meetings).</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">5. Talk Prep: writing or practicing a talk or poster presentation.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">6. Service: volunteer work (e.g., organizing outreach activities).</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">7. Problem Set: homework for a class that is not coding- or reading-focused.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">8. Other.</p><p>The median task took 1.4 times as long to accomplish as expected, while the average difference was a slightly larger 1.7 times. Just over half, 53%, of tasks were completed on time. Writing and coding tasks took the longest, with some taking ten times as long as expected.</p><p><em>Note to editor: See, it's not just me!</em></p><p>Tasks with deadlines were completed on time. This is shown in the problem set and service categories, as homework has a due date and volunteer events are planned. Postdocs were more accurate than anybody else, but this might be caused less by their age and experience and more by the type of work they were doing. Graduate students were worse than undergrads, suggesting that age is not a substantial factor.</p><h2>Hopefully, you've read this far</h2><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j__gupDTH5s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe></div><p>It seems that even highly educated people who have to estimate the time their typical work will take on a regular basis aren't very good at it. It seems to be a universal truth that most tasks take much longer than expected. Even those who are quite experienced at these tasks were little better at making these estimations. </p><p>So, if you're planning on doing something within a certain period of time, it might be best to lengthen your original estimate. But beware! This might cause the actual time required to multiply yet again.<br/></p><p>Alternatively, since tasks that come with hard deadlines tended to be completed on time at much better rates than those without, you could just add deadlines and stressful consequences for missing them to your goals.

What's attractive to scientists in studying comets that haven't changed much in their lifetimes is that they have a similar composition to the gas and dust that was present at the formation of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago.

This helped the team compare 2I/Borisov to other local comets. The properties of the new comet were quite different from others they found in the Solar System, except for Hale-Bopp, a comet discovered in 1995 which is also considered very pristine.</p><p>The study's co-author Alberto Cellino from the Astrophysical Observatory of Torino, Italy, commented upon this connection, arrived at by analyzing polarization along with the comet's color: </p><p>\"The fact that the two comets are remarkably similar suggests that the environment in which 2I/Borisov originated is not so different in composition from the environment in the early Solar System.\".</p><p>In a fascinating nod to just how powerful Earth's top telescopes have become, another set of ESO researchers published a different study in<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso2106/eso2106b.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Nature Astronomy</a> on the comet's composition using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This team, led by astronomer Bin Yang, was able to gather many clues about 2I/Borisov's makeup from its <em>coma</em> – the envelope of dust surrounding it. Inside the coma, they discovered compact pebbles, grains around one millimeter in size. They could also tell that the relative amounts of carbon monoxide and water in the comet changed significantly as it came closer to the Sun. </p><p>This indicated to them that the materials in the comet came from different places in the cosmos. Matter in the comet's home star system was likely mixed in a discernible pattern that related to how far the comet was from its star, found the scientists. This was possibly affected by the presence of giant planets, which stirred up materials in their system through strong gravity. Astronomers think this kind of process also took place in the early period of the Solar System's life. </p><p>\"Imagine how lucky we were that a comet from a system light-years away simply took a trip to our doorstep by chance,\" <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2106/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remarked</a> Yang.</p><p>In 2029, the European Space Agency plans to launch the Comet Interceptor project that would allow scientists to study comets that speed through our Solar System with even greater precision.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/sXGV9sLtp9Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 13:41:44 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAxNTUxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MDk2ODYwOH0.v19RfwJa71kme6Qn0u2QGrKsM1zUTLl8xMSl-D8fdiE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=2%2C0%2C3%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"41511a02cb3fbab461804e34e9b07122","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn30@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-19-755_9456d848a8324610.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":84584,"destBytes":84584,"author":"Paul Ratner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAxNTUxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MDk2ODYwOH0.v19RfwJa71kme6Qn0u2QGrKsM1zUTLl8xMSl-D8fdiE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=2%2C0%2C3%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn30@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-19-755_9456d848a8324610.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/sXGV9sLtp9Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn93@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-32-991_564ddfb37546ff54.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026319307},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","title":"Even in mathematics, who you know may matter more than your talent","link":"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/inequality-mathematics","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk1MTc3MC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2Nzc4MDIyNn0.IHyxAmmD_eJuIJM5EoK6ZKoJwT47NTSAcSpgOJDGvK4/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=29%2C16%2C0%2C2&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>In a recent study, researchers collected data on the backgrounds and academic genealogy of thousands of mathematicians.</li><li>The results revealed that mathematicians of certain backgrounds—namely, from Western countries—are significantly more likely to join elite circles in mathematics.</li><li>The researchers issued recommendations for how elite institutions could help the Fields Medal accomplish its original goal.</li></ul><hr/><p><br/></p><p>As the \"universal language,\" mathematics is commonly considered to be an egalitarian field.</p><p>After all, there's far less room for subjectivity when judging works in algebraic geometry than, say, literature or sociology.

If that happens, places like Alaska could suffer significantly higher rates of wildfires and permafrost loss, both of which could accelerate warming in the Arctic. </p><p>Some evidence suggests these changes are already underway. In 2015, Alaska suffered the <a href=\"https://climatechange.medill.northwestern.edu/2015/12/02/fires-in-alaska/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second-most wildfires on record,</a> burning more than 5.1 million acres across the state's northern region.

Without those plants covering the ground, soil temperatures would rise, making it easier for deciduous trees to grow. </p><p>That might sound like a good thing.

In 2018 the<a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a24219132/darpa-emdrive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> agency invested</a> $1.3 million to study the device in research that will be wrapping up this May barring any significant last-minute breakthroughs.\n</p><p>\n\tTeams from all over the world have been testing Shawyer's idea since it was introduced and releasing often contradictory test results. This may have to do with the fact that teams detecting any EmDrive thrust at all have reported vanishingly small amounts of it, measured in milliNewtons (mN). A mN equals about 0.00022 pounds of force.\n</p><p>\n\tAs<a href=\"https://www.space.com/author/paul-sutter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Paul Sutter</a> wrote in an op-ed for<a href=\"https://www.space.com/can-emdrive-space-propulsion-concept-work\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Space.com</a>:\n</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n\t\"Ever since the introduction of the EmDrive concept in 2001, every few years a group claims to have measured a net force coming from its device. But these researchers are measuring an incredibly tiny effect: a force so small it couldn't even budge a piece of paper. This leads to significant statistical uncertainty and measurement error.\"\n</p><p>\n\tFor a sense of how minuscule these results are, consider that the possible thrust force<a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140006052\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> reported by NASA</a> in 2014 of 30-50 micro-Newtons is roughly equivalent to the weight of a big ant. Chinese researchers<a href=\"http://www.emdrive.com/yang-juan-paper-2012.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> have claimed</a> detection of 720 mN in their tests. That would be 72 grams of thrust. An iPhone 11 with a case weights 219 grams.</p><h2>Too small to stand out against background noise</h2><p>\n\tThese tiny amounts of EmDrive thrust lie at the heart of what the TU Dresden researchers are saying: The effects are simply too small to rule out effects that don't really come from the EmDrives at all. The researchers have just published three papers. The title of one \"<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350108418_High-Accuracy_Thrust_Measurements_of_the_EMDrive_and_Elimination_of_False-Positive_Effects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">High-Accuracy Thrust Measurements of the EmDrive and Elimination of False-Positive Effects</a>\" tells the story.

This also causes the fastening elements on the scale to warp, causing the scale to move to a new zero point. We were able to prevent that in an improved structure.\"\n</p><p>\n\tPutting the kibosh on other researchers' results, the authors of the studies write:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Using a geometry and operating conditions close to the model by<a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140006052\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> White et al.</a> that reported positive results published in the peer-reviewed literature, we found no thrust values within a wide frequency band including several resonance frequencies. Our data limits any anomalous thrust to below the force equivalent from classical radiation for a given amount of power. This provides strong limits to all proposed theories and rules out previous test results by more than three orders of magnitude.\"\n</p><p>\n\tThis would seem to be the definitive end of the EmDrive story.\n</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/QRZ4yRgXrso\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk5MjQzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNDgzNjc1OX0.8bm5OwJoNm3Ch81e6EAGhKbmQ9X4GkNI1rbSEMwzk44/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"bd8e1641edb0331b4982956db365032a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-53-101_79cee3aa4fd24e8d.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":34954,"destBytes":34954,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk5MjQzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNDgzNjc1OX0.8bm5OwJoNm3Ch81e6EAGhKbmQ9X4GkNI1rbSEMwzk44/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-53-101_79cee3aa4fd24e8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/QRZ4yRgXrso":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn11@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-58-233_ea0e923b7a3b8e41.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026319307},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","title":"Do animals see the world the way we do?","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/rhesus-supraliminal","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk1MDg3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MDkwNTYyMX0.v1N-xULHo7_rMs6orZ5DhRgWnPV2p60SSAz6hdw3pNc/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\">\n\t<li>Humans have the capacity for conscious awareness of our visual world.</li>\n\t<li>While all sighted animals respond to visual stimuli, we don't know if any of them consciously take note of what they're seeing in the way that we do.</li>\n\t<li>Researchers from Yale have devised experiments that suggest that rhesus monkeys share this ability.</li>\n</ul><div><br/></div><hr/><p>\n\tAll day long, our brains are busy receiving sensory information: smells, sounds, sights, and so on.

Even so, she says, \"We tend to show different patterns of learning when presented with subliminal stimuli than we do for consciously experienced, or supraliminal stimuli.\" (\"Supraliminal\" describes visual stimuli that are consciously noted.)\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n\tThe authors of the study set out to see if rhesus monkeys exhibited a similar \"double disassociation\" in the way they respond to supraliminal vs. subliminal visual stimuli.\n</p><h2>Ask a monkey a question</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"b916d42a9e5008baddf90d73951ea807\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk1MDc5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NzE3NDU4OH0.16kHB95JAZDzjGIMsdo64pBgrylnAhx6HDqJOEqoIKY/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"954\" id=\"b091c\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1440\"/>\n\t<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@haughters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie Haughton</a>/Unsplash</small>\n</p><p>\n\tObviously, research on animals is hampered by our inability to question critters. As a result, scientists need to be creative in designing experimental methods that allow them to draw conclusions based strictly on empirical observation.\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n\t\"People have wondered for a long time whether animals experience the world the way we do, but it's been difficult to figure out a good way to test this question empirically,\" says first author of the study, Moshe Shay Ben-Haim, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University.\n</p><p>\n\tThe researchers came up with a series of experiments in which both humans and rhesus monkeys could observably demonstrate how they process subliminal and supraliminal visual stimuli.\n</p><p>\n\tIn the experiments, participants were tasked with predicting the side of a computer screen on which a target image would appear depending on the position of a visual cue, a small star symbol, provided by the researchers.\n</p><p>\n\tWhen the researchers displayed the cue on one side of the screen long enough to ensure that it was noticed — that is, it was a supraliminal signal — both humans and monkeys learned to look for the target image on the opposite side of the screen.\n</p><p>\n\tOn the other hand, when the star flashed on the screen only very briefly, both humans and monkeys consistently looked to the side on which this subliminal signal had appeared, anticipating the target image's appearance there.\n</p><p>\n\tIn the first case, the subjects learned the significance of the cue's position. In the second, their response simply mirrored the subliminal cue. This, say the authors, demonstrates the different ways in which humans — and monkeys apparently — react to visual stimuli that are consciously noticed or not.\n</p><p>\n\tBen-Haim summarizes the authors' interpretation of the experiment:\n</p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p>\n\t\"These results show that at least one non-human animal exhibits both non-conscious perception as well as human-like conscious visual awareness.

In threatening times, our best defense is to act together to the benefit of all.</li></ul><hr/><p>Pandemic fatigue is beginning to grind. Amidst yet another pandemic wave cresting in America and in Europe, we have to ask ourselves what's going on, now that vaccines are becoming available. Americans are justly proud of living in a country where personal choices—political, religious, sexual—are supposedly free. I write \"supposedly\" because clearly there is widespread prejudice and judgement of others and their choices. Acceptance of differences and open-mindedness is still on the to-do list for many. Still, at least we don't have army tanks rolling down the streets when people demonstrate their political or social views. Not usually anyway. For comparison, look at what's happening in Myanmar.</p><p>What puzzles me is what could be called the ditching of privilege. I look, for example, at the situation in Brazil, where I was born and grew up. A huge shortage of vaccines and a government that has consistently downplayed the science has resulted in massive fatalities. People are clamoring for help while hospitals are nearing capacity. In the U.S., vaccines are becoming widely available for younger sectors of the population. In two to three months, we could reach herd immunity and life could be close to normal again. Yet, many are choosing not to take the vaccine or to wear masks. \"It is my choice and no government should mess with it!\" This kind of choice illustrates a confusing conflict between personal freedom and civic duty. When should you sacrifice your personal choices and views for the benefit of your family, community, and ultimately, country?</p><blockquote>The choice to get a vaccine and to wear a mask is an expression of your <em>freedom to</em> be a moral citizen and to protect your family, community, and country. </blockquote><p>I'm going to take a detour here and go back to another time when a group of individuals had to face a very difficult choice between personal views and civic duty. In 1941, the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor prompted the US to join the Allies in the war against Germany and Japan. Two years earlier, on 2-August-1939, Albert Einstein wrote a <a href=\"https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Resources/einstein_letter_photograph.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to President Franklin Roosevelt sounding the alarm of a very possible Nazi nuclear bomb. \"In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America,\" Einstein wrote. </p><p>Now, Einstein was an outspoken pacifist, as were many of the physicists then working to understand nuclear chain reactions. When the Manhattan Project to build a U.S. atomic bomb started for real in 1942, the main worry and motivation for the group of scientists working in secrecy at Los Alamos was the fear of Hitler with a nuclear bomb in his hands. A split happened within the group. Some scientists pushed the moral worries of building a weapon of mass destruction aside and undertook the formidable technical challenge as another tough scientific problem to figure out. Others, however, had serious moral qualms in participating in the project, knowing very well what the social and political consequences would be. Still, they pushed their personal views aside and worked to build the bomb. The fear of a Nazi threat and the sense of civic duty, the need to protect their country, their community, their families, and their values took center stage, superseding their personal choice.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"3e3a26e69b3f6f8a6ddad56af0599d20\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyMzMwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTMzNDAxMn0.Cnp9vzmX1STDGDD0Rd1xTloupnxzL0CXwI7srBjFwtA/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1552\" id=\"22db5\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1920\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Erich Fromm</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm#/media/File:Erich_Fromm_1974.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Müller-May / Rainer Funk</a> via Wikipedia licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/deed.en\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 3.0 de</a>.</small></p><p>Choosing to place community and love for the nation over personal gain or values is what German social psychologist and humanistic philosopher <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Escape-Freedom-Erich-Fromm/dp/0805031499\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Erich Fromm</a> called \"freedom to,\" as opposed to \"freedom from.\" Fromm argued that the course of civilization and industrialization led citizens to an ever-growing process of individuation—the realization of your aloneness as an individual in a large society— where the weight of choosing for oneself became a heavy emotional burden. People that once saw themselves protected by their communities and religious faith were now set adrift by the very progress of democracy and capitalism. Freedom came with a heavy emotional cost. The consequence was the rise of fascist authoritarian governments that effectively chose for the individuals, giving them a sense of relief from the burden of choice.</p><p>Most people focus their battles in the \"freedom from\" category, confused between their individual freedom and their duties to community and country. The scientists that chose to continue working on the bomb against their personal values did so because they were not focusing on their individual choices above all others. They understood that the damage from the outside threat—a Nazi bomb—would have a devastating effect for their lives, families, communities, and country. So, they chose to work on the bomb to protect their freedom.<br/></p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p>Let's apply this lesson to vaccines and mask-wearing. At face value, these seem to be personal choices. And if you see them as personal choices then you conclude that any action against your personal choice is a threat to your <em>freedom from</em> government control. But that's a fundamental mistake. The choice to get a vaccine and to wear a mask is an expression of your <em>freedom to</em> be a moral citizen and to protect your family, community, and country. The virus is the outside threat that has already compromised everyone's way of life, caused immense loss and pain, and wreaked havoc with the economy across the globe. By doing something for your family, community, and country you exercise your freedom to protect what's dear to you. This is what an act of love is.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/N1k7t2V0fd8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 16:05:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyNjE4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MjE0OTA4MH0.TZRMoZPx9kPUQmFahrTYGfoxhfWJEUv2bPN3YZgsGoI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C160%2C0%2C410&height=700","linkMd5":"dc145ace79a6ef3eeb60d3120aebb669","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn35@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-19-826_7c3ea9df5a61bd0d.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":39962,"destBytes":39962,"author":"Marcelo Gleiser","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyNjE4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MjE0OTA4MH0.TZRMoZPx9kPUQmFahrTYGfoxhfWJEUv2bPN3YZgsGoI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C160%2C0%2C410&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn35@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-19-826_7c3ea9df5a61bd0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/N1k7t2V0fd8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-58-256_077bcbd4d07a39d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026319309},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","title":"Why people become radical extremists and how to help them","link":"https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/radical-extremists","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzMTEwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxOTk3NDg0Nn0.HF_u_LFud3SH6zjcAHZbOsYeb87rnbfU4zyxB16BvWA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C156%2C0%2C156&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>A new study features interviews with 24 former extremists on the radicalization process. </li><li>Financial instability, online propaganda, and reorienting events that caused them to \"snap\" are leading causes of indoctrination. </li><li>The research team offers potential solutions, including exposure to diverse ideas during childhood and a tamping down of polarization and media sensationalism.</li></ul><hr/><p>Researchers are continuing to unpack the reasons why extremists stormed the Capitol on January 6.

(1) Financial instability: In 22 cases, financial instability was key, with seven former extremists claiming this as the main reason they joined an extremist organization. (2) Mental health issues: In 17 cases, overwhelming anger predominated, but PTSD, trauma, substance abuse, and depression around physical issues also played a role. (3) Social factors: Marginalization, victimization, and stigmatization were mentioned in 16 cases. </p><p>Often, these background characteristics weren't enough. In over half the cases, there was a \"reorienting event,\" that is, a moment that \"broke\" them, such as being rejected from the military, experiencing long-term unemployment, or enduring a friend's suicide. Propaganda was involved in 22 cases, predominantly through social media but also through books and music. Another factor was direct and indirect recruitment, with indirect recruitment being much more common. In other words, the individuals sought to join extremists groups. Social bonds played a role in 14 cases, including \"graduating\" from one organization to a more extreme group.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"bde6214516f750f61682b249ee410e99\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzMTExMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTQ3MTY3NX0.NCbZBnI6VCJ1dLOIeN5qmmybpWBHHlMmSmg5YgEJlj8/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"2688\" id=\"1ac2b\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4032\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\" spellcheck=\"false\">A Proud Boy member is armed with a gun labeled \"Zombie Killer\" as members and supporters of Patriot Prayer gather in Esther Short Park for a memorial for member Aaron J.

The most common reasons for leaving are feelings of disillusionment and burnout. Members grew disappointed by the failed promises of leaders or noticed hypocrisy among the ranks. Over half of the individuals were involved in failed deradicalization efforts, however, showing the resilience of these organizations even when family members and friends try to intervene. </p><p>The good news is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. An extremist isn't a lost cause. The team lists important steps for helping extremists leave hate groups as well as for preventing people from being seduced in the first place. The researchers' recommendations include: </p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Exposure to diverse ideas, especially during childhood</li><li>The development of critical thinking skills</li><li>Participation in prosocial activities that promote positive behaviors and inclusiveness</li><li>Exposure to different racial and cultural groups</li><li>Addressing marginalization more broadly</li><li>A tamping down of polarization and media sensationalism</li><li>Better access to mental health treatment </li><li>Targeted outreach and support for military veterans</li></ul><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p>The researchers note that this is a small study sample, so further work is necessary.

Preventing extremism therefore requires a holistic approach that addresses topics such as childhood education, poverty, mental health, ethnic and racial animosity, and the prevalence of propaganda.</p><p>--</p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.

It's as much a cage as a luxury. </li><li>Being dependent on a thing gives it power over you. To need something or someone is, for better or worse, to limit yourself.</li></ul><hr/><p><span></span>Philippa has decided she wants to quit social media. She's worried about how addictive it is and thinks it's not doing her any good at all. But then, how will she speak to her aunt in South Africa? What will happen to all of her photos? And how can she organize that party?</p><p>Trevor wants to leave the country. He distrusts the government, dislikes the people, and hates the weather. But, then, he does get good healthcare. And he does like the TV. The roads are pretty good, too.</p><p>Philippa and Trevor are two examples of how luxury, technology, and easy-living can ensnare us or box us in. In many ways, it's a modern and relatable phenomenon, but it goes back at least to the Roman writer, Tacitus. It's the idea that the trappings of civilization <em>enslave</em> us. How is it that, without even knowing it, those things we thought were helpful and time-saving became indispensable essentials?</p><h2>The hidden danger of luxury</h2><p>The Roman army was one of the most militarily effective and successful forces the world has ever known. On open land, their legions were pretty much unbeatable. But the Roman Empire was not built on the back of military genius and short, stabbing swords alone. The legions might have beaten a people, but they did not <em>subdue</em> them. It was the love of luxury and easy living that did that.</p><p>The Britons, Tacitus noted, were enslaved, not by chains, but by their desire for good wine and elegant dinner parties. In fact, the governor of Britain, Agricola, deliberately sought to pacify this tribal warrior society by the \"delightful distractions\" of warm baths, togas, and education. As Tacitus wrote, \"The naïve Britons described these things as 'civilization,' when in fact they were simply part of their enslavement.\" </p><p>Comfort and convenience had morphed painted, screaming warriors into genteel, pacified civilians. (It should be noted that Tacitus likely over-exaggerated all this. Britain was never as compliant as France or Spain in the Roman Empire.)</p><p>The use of luxury to win over a people is a tactic mirrored across time.</p><p>Faced with a trade deficit with China, the British Empire flooded their country with cheap opium they had shipped over from India. A luxury drug became an addiction, and the British traded their opium for porcelain, tea, and silk.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"85f6eb129aac54d724a9ccc5105511f2\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzMzA4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NzMxODIxOX0.8JIhCYqzawWtkh2AKPqjqcqoG7m006X-ZmmhV7xGY7k/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"652\" id=\"ff6fa\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"850\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Mikhail Gorbachev enjoying the American way of life.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev#/media/File:Reagan_and_Gorbachev_in_western_hats_1992.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: Bob Galbraith / Public domain via Wikipedia</small></p><p><br/></p><p>The Cold War was also won on the back of luxury. When cheap American TVs and refrigerators inevitably worked their way into the USSR, the Soviets couldn't hope to match such opulence. The bloc came to see such \"luxury\" domestic goods as essential, and only the USA could give them.</p><p>But the most relatable example for most of us today is our relationship with Big Tech. Companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google slowly and surely wire our lives into their algorithms and platforms. Social media are designed and calibrated to be deliberately addictive. Time- or money-saving services, like cloud-based storage, have become so universal, that going back is becoming impossible. It's increasingly the case that we don't even know our passwords for things—we let our phones or apps invent and store them for us.</p><h2>You can't leave the machine</h2><p>A new technology or service is initially a luxury—until it becomes so normalized and ubiquitous, so essential—that we can't go back to the time before it appeared. What was once a \"want\" becomes a \"need.\"</p><p>E.M. Forster's novella, \"The Machine Stops\", imagines a world where every facet of life is provided by \"the machine.\" There are buttons \"to call for food, music, clothing, hot baths, literature and, of course, communication with friends.\" How prescient has this turned out to be? Today, we have Uber, Skype, Hello Fresh, and Amazon Prime. Our friends and family are also plugged into the machine. </p><p>Is it possible to leave?</p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p>Though we view technology as liberating, it also boxes us in. If we believe Tacitus, we are now enslaved by the things we once saw as luxury. It's the job of philosophy to see these chains for what they are. And, as we examine our lives, we can then choose to wear them happily or start the long hard journey of throwing them off.</p><p><em>Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford.

To our surprise, we found that as many as 76 genomic locations predictive of the brain shape had previously already been found to be linked to the face shape. This makes the genetic link between face and brain shape a convincing one.\"</p><p>The study also found that the genetic signalling pathways responsible for shaping the brain and face are enriched in parts of the genome that regulate gene activity during embryogenesis, which is the period of time during which an embryo develops and forms. </p><p>Together, the findings suggest that, just as the brain affects facial structure, so too does the face affect brain structure. </p><p>But unlike <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/elise-bohan/women-have-a-biological-advantage-on-dating-apps\" target=\"_blank\">some previous studies</a> that suggest facial appearance may reveal information about cognitive capability, the new research doesn't show that you can look at someone's facial structure and then reliably predict their intelligence or behavioral traits. The researchers made sure to emphasize this aspect of the study, considering there's a history of people trying to advance racial discrimination based on psuedoscientific claims about the face-brain relationship, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology\" target=\"_blank\">phrenology</a> being one example.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The link between the brain and the face has fascinated humans for a very long time,\" Wysocka told <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/03/Face-brain-development-tightly-linked-study-finds.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford Medicine News Center</a>. \"Many theories have tried to explain this relationship.

More specifically, as gender roles have become more fluid, have children's preferences toward gender-typed toys become more fluid, too?</p><p>The short answer seems to be no. For decades, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/07/160715114739.htm\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a> <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/homo-consumericus/201212/sex-specific-toy-preferences-learned-or-innate\" target=\"_blank\">have shown</a> that boys and girls generally prefer playing with toys typically associated with their biological sex: toy trucks for boys and dolls for girls, to give a rough example.</p><p>These results have remained remarkably stable over the past 50 years, according to a 2020 meta-analysis of research on gender differences in toy preferences. Published in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-01989-8\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em></a> and titled \"The Magnitude of Children's Gender‐Related Toy Interests Has Remained Stable Over 50 Years of Research,\" the analysis examined 75 previous studies, 113 effect sizes, and a range of toy preference measurements. </p><blockquote>No matter what society wants, it's worth noting that there seems to be some biological drivers behind children's preferences for gender-typical toys.</blockquote><p>The authors, Jac T. M. Davis and Melissa Hines, found \"a broad consistency of results across the large body of research on children's gender-related toy preferences: children showed large and reliable preferences for toys that were related to their own gender. Thus, according to our review, gender-related toy preferences may be considered a well-established finding.\"</p><p>A letter to the editor in the same journal sought to challenge these findings in a separate <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-01916-x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">analysis</a>, which concluded that children actually spend less time playing with gender-typical toys these days. </p><p>The authors of that analysis speculated that the reason for this decline \"might reflect social pressures in recent times for children to be less gender-typical in their behavior.\" In other words, the decline stems from parents wanting to be more in line with progressive ideas about gender fluidity. </p><p>However, Davis and Hines disagreed, proposing that the supposed decline appeared in the analysis only because of the specific methodology employed by the researchers.

Unfortunately, however, broad change in the social roles of men and women do not seem to have influenced children's toy choices, perhaps because they have been counteracted by stronger marketing of different toys to girls and boys over recent time. If society wants girls and boys to play with the full range of toys, more targeted action is probably required.\"<span></span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Little boy playing mathematics wooden toy at nursery\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"fb367869686ad03cbd1dd84aada1224a\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzNTA4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2ODk4MDkzNH0.ZJC_sylmbACQiQu1zssRSPUnHdPU3qUmeNfKDWDnYf0/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"4444\" id=\"97213\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"6658\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Little boy playing mathematics wooden toy at nursery</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/204567087/rawpixel-com?load_type=author&prev_url=detail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rawpixel.com</a> via Adobe Stock</small></p><p><br/></p><h2>Why are we so concerned about which toys kids play with? </h2><p>But does society really want kids to play with less gender-typical toys? Some research suggests the answer is yes. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/19/most-americans-see-value-in-steering-children-toward-toys-activities-associated-with-opposite-gender/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2017 survey from Pew Research Center</a> found that a majority of Americans considered it a \"somewhat or very good thing\" to steer kids toward toys and activities traditionally associated with the opposite gender (though respondents were less enthusiastic about doing so for boys than girls). </p><p>Encouraging kids to play with a wider range of toys could yield benefits. For example, a 2020 study published in <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560176/full\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</em></a> found that when both boys and girls play with dolls, they experience heightened activation within brain regions associated with empathy and perspective-taking. </p><p>But no matter what society wants, it's worth noting that there seems to be some biological drivers behind children's preferences for gender-typical toys. </p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19016318/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a> have shown that babies tend to prefer toys oriented to their own gender, a finding that suggests their preference is innate because they're in the pre-socialization stage of development. Supporting that argument are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583786/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">studies showing</a> that baby monkeys also display gender-typical toy preferences. </p><p>Still, it's easy to see how social pressures might affect kids' toy preferences as they grow up. So, the question of why kids prefer the toys that they do likely boils down to a familiar answer: a tangled mix of environmental and biological factors.</p><div></div><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/n-1je0l4CMU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:36:24 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzNTA4NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNTM5MTk0NX0.Nc2SoOrxGIk7iEPBTxk28DrHcD5MypvznNZrUu4XD9I/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C364%2C0%2C370&height=700","linkMd5":"86497a72d1d8abe17b64c1b398ba350f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn48@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-33-741_904fd49e043c9759.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":58972,"destBytes":58972,"author":"Stephen Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAzNTA4NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNTM5MTk0NX0.Nc2SoOrxGIk7iEPBTxk28DrHcD5MypvznNZrUu4XD9I/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C364%2C0%2C370&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn48@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-33-741_904fd49e043c9759.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/n-1je0l4CMU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn83@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-58-104_9573b42250068741.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026319307},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","title":"The universe has a Hubble constant problem","link":"https://bigthink.com/13-8/universe-hubble-constant-problem","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyNjkzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzODY1Njg1MH0.YRgLkzM56bGikd7HJ2Uegrkk3i2RE2ZvYii4T1oL4yQ/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C292%2C0%2C1&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"> <li>The Hubble constant is used to estimate the rate of expansion of the universe.</li><li>There are two different ways to calculate its value, but they give different results.</li><li>The difference may give physicists an opening to find new cosmic laws, but there is huge uncertainty about which path to take in finding them. </li></ul><hr/><p><span></span>There's something wrong with the universe. Okay, it's not the universe that's the problem; it's our understanding of the universe. The problem lies with cosmology—the branch of science that studies cosmic evolution—and it's only getting worse. But that may, or may not, turn out to be a good thing.</p><p>Talk to an astronomer or a physicist about the state of the art in understanding the universe and they'll tell you we've entered the \"Precision Age\" of cosmology. The data relevant to cosmic evolution have gotten so good we know all the relevant parameters – things like the universe's age and average density – down to a few decimal places. That's a pretty impressive achievement.</p><p>One of the most important of these cosmic parameters is what's known as the Hubble constant (cosmologists write it as H<sub>o</sub>). Modern cosmology tells us the universe has been expanding since its beginning in the Big Bang. The <a href=\"https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_expansion.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hubble constant</a> specifies the rate of that expansion. It's also related to the age of the universe. Larger values of H<sub>o</sub> mean a younger universe. Smaller values of H<sub>o</sub> mean an older universe. </p><blockquote>A conflict <em>between different ways</em> of measuring [the Hubble constant] is now making big news in cosmology, and no one is sure what's the right next step.</blockquote><p>Back when Edwin Hubble first discovered that the universe was expanding, his crude data gave H<sub>o</sub> = 500 (we'll ignore the units). This value was so large it gave an age of the universe that was shorter than the age of the sun or the earth. Better measurements soon gave much lower values of H<sub>o</sub>, resolving this conflict. But the idea of conflicts with measured values of H<sub>o</sub> didn't go away. A conflict <em>between different ways</em> of measuring H<sub>o</sub> is now making big news in cosmology, and no one is sure what's the right next step.</p><h2>More constants, more problems</h2><p>There are basically two modern ways to measure the Hubble constant. The first is based on looking at what cosmologists call the \"late\" universe. Astronomers try to make direct measurements of how fast distant objects are moving away from us (i.e., their redshift). There are two parts to these kinds of observations. First, astronomers need an accurate measurement of an object's distance. Then they need to obtain an accurate measurement of its redshift. Using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07603\" target=\"_blank\">supernovae</a> as \"standard candles\" for getting distances to far away galaxies, this late universe method gives a value of the Hubble constant of H<sub>o</sub> = 74.03.</p><p>The other method relies on data from the \"early\" universe, i.e., right after the Big Bang. Microwave radiation emitted by matter about 300,000 years after the cosmic beginning provides astronomers with a rich source of early universe measurements. The best data from this cosmic microwave background comes from the Planck satellite launched back in 2009. And the best analysis of the Planck data yields H<sub>o</sub> = 67.40, which is clearly not the same value as supernova data. Hence the two methods produce conflicting results. Not knowing which value is right, we can't pin down other properties like, for example, the exact age of the universe.</p><p>The conflict between the two approaches is itself not news. People have been playing this game for a while, and during all that time, there was always some difference between the early and late universe approaches. But everyone thought it was just a matter of time until new and better data resolved the conflict. Eventually, it was believed, the final value would lie somewhere between H<sub>o</sub> = 74.03 and H<sub>o</sub> = 67.40. But things haven't worked out that way and that <em>is</em> <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hubble-tension-headache-clashing-measurements-make-the-universes-expansion-a-lingering-mystery/\" target=\"_blank\">news</a>.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"ea67cbbbe2141a743f2169b766c6f1de\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyNjk4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NTIyMDk3NH0.1X0dwtbHrJs8e6nYaqTaDlXpv2gyWbx5L9aLYE_PjfA/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1900\" id=\"2a6af\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1900\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">The Kepler supernova remnant </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&photographer=AFP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AFP</a> via <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/this-image-released-07-october-2004-by-nasa-shows-keplers-news-photo/51438012?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Getty Images</a></small></p><p><br/></p><p>Over the last few years, measurements of the late universe approach have been getting better and better. This means the inherent \"errors\" or \"uncertainty\" in this value of H<sub>o</sub> are getting so small there's no chance for a reconciliation with the early universe methods. The gold standard for a measurement is when it achieves the \"5 sigma\" level, which basically means the confidence in the measured value reaches astronomical (no pun intended) levels. With measurements announced in 2019, the late universe value of H<sub>o</sub> was close, or had crossed, the 5 sigma threshold.</p><p>So, if the late universe measurement is solid, then what's going on? What are cosmologists missing? The most exciting possibility is that the conflict is not about errors in measurement or analysis but instead point us towards the holy grail of new physics. </p><p>To make their early universe measurements of H<sub>o</sub>, cosmologists must heavily rely on their dominant cosmological model. This is something called the \"Lambda Cold Dark Matter\" model or Lambda-CDM. It is based on the universe being made mainly of dark energy (lambda) and a slow moving form of dark matter. This model (or theory) makes predictions that have been very, very well tested. In other words, it works. But the tension between the two methods of determining H<sub>o</sub> has some cosmological theorists ready to make changes to Lambda-CDM that could have big consequences for our understanding of the universe. These <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01183.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">changes</a> range from just fiddling with the nature of dark energy all the way up to changing Einstein's theory of relativity.</p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p>The problem is Lambda-CDM works so well, in so many ways, that it's not something one throws out lightly. Any change to any of its components will have consequences that can mess up the places that it already does work in explaining what we see in the cosmos. What all this means is that the tension in Hubble's constant offers us a lesson in how science progresses. Cosmologists have a paradigm they love and it mostly works. But along comes this problem and, as philosopher of science <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Kuhn</a> pointed out, there are typical ways scientists will respond to the problem. At first everyone thinks the problem will go away. But then it doesn't. So what should they do? They could tinker with the old theory in a way that looks jury-rigged. They could abandon the old theory entirely at enormous cost. They could also keep poking around and hope things work themselves out. So what should they do? What would you do?</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/CMa28I9FPg4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyNjkzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzODY1Njg1MH0.YRgLkzM56bGikd7HJ2Uegrkk3i2RE2ZvYii4T1oL4yQ/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C292%2C0%2C1&height=700","linkMd5":"300cf2f4624a6bb98479392de9240a98","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn44@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-19-872_01079ba99ff75b4e.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":182048,"destBytes":182048,"author":"Adam Frank","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyNjkzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzODY1Njg1MH0.YRgLkzM56bGikd7HJ2Uegrkk3i2RE2ZvYii4T1oL4yQ/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C292%2C0%2C1&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn44@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-19-872_01079ba99ff75b4e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/CMa28I9FPg4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn80@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-58-104_190f7b62428f979d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026319309},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","title":"How your daily coffee can help tropical forests grow back","link":"https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/coffee-pulp","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk4OTkxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzODU2NzI4OH0.amlg5ilWpM212sUjIabx9YFkozK5IZvuMN3x97qwAgI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><li>When coffee is harvested, the skin and pulp surrounding the bean are often discarded.</li>\n\t<li>Costa Rica, which had much of its tropical forests chopped down for agricultural use, is testing coffee pulp as a way to help reforest the country.</li>\n\t<li>A new study finds that coffee pulp can help reforest land in just two years.</li><hr/><ul class=\"ee-ul\">\n</ul><p>\n\tThe coffee beans that keep us going don't grow on the vine in bean form.

Variations of it date back to Plato and Confucius, and the area is currently enjoying a tremendous amount of attention as thinkers from a variety of fields, including philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, consider the different aspects that go into making moral judgments.</p><p>But what is a moral judgment? Is there only one kind of judgment, or do we use different kinds in different situations? Are they all the same at the cognitive level?</p><p>A new <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-072220-104358\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> by <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/bertram-f-malle\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Dr. Bertram F. Malle</u></a> of Brown University offers a framework for understanding how people make moral judgments and what factors go into those judgments.</p><h2>You are judgmental</h2><p>The first type of judgment is dubbed \"<strong>evaluations</strong>.\" These are the simple evaluations we make of things being good, bad, positive, or negative. We do this for just about everything, including in non-moral situations like when evaluating writing, and our brains are very good at doing it quickly. Some studies suggest that our brains begin to evaluate for goodness or badness within half a second of getting the information. This first pass doesn't have all the data the other kinds of judgments do, but it helps set the stage for more complicated moral judgments.</p><p>The second type is \"<strong>norm judgments</strong>.\" This expansive category involves deciding if some action or thing is allowed, permissible, taboo, or otherwise acceptable. This determination is related to, but not dependent on, how we evaluate something. While evaluations can be done on any thing or action, norm judgments are limited to actions and often to future ones. Less reactive than the other judgments, this one can be applied before any action is taken and is often used to help determine what should be done before anything happens. Often invoking abstract notions of virtue and value, this category can be a bit more deliberative than the others. </p><p>The third kind is \"<strong>wrongness judgments</strong>.\" These combine elements of the previous two to identify intentional violations of norms that are considered egregious. Our brains can do this fairly accurately in less than half a second. In experiments asking test subjects to identify actions as morally wrong or neutral, the accuracy rate neared 90% when given a little more time to do it. </p><p>While they are similar, a wrongness judgment is not the same as a norm judgment. Studies asking people to rank actions in terms of permissibility and wrongness find that people will often consider an action to be both wrong and permissible, such as pulling a lever to save five people at the cost of another person's life in the classic trolley problem. </p><p>Likewise, these judgments differ from evaluations in that wrongness is an entirely moral trait. While we might evaluate a \"dad joke\" as \"bad,\" we likely won't consider it \"wrong\" unless it's sexist, racist, or otherwise egregious.</p><p>Last is \"<strong>blame judgment</strong>.\" If wrongness judgments combine evaluations and norm judgments in a new way, then blame judgments combine all three. This is the most complex of the judgment categories. It includes factors of intentionality and justification -- most people blame somebody for accidentally spilling milk less than they'd blame them for intentionally pouring a gallon on the floor.</p><p>Like the other reactive judgments, this one is carried out quickly. Our brains start to place blame in less than two seconds. Blame is not only a social tool; it can help us understand who did what but can also help us regulate our moral behavior in the future.</p><h2>What use does this have? Can I use this to understand my behavior?</h2><p>Perhaps most striking is how quickly our brains process moral information. Within less than two seconds of seeing an action with a moral dimension to it, your brain has already made a basic judgment on if it was good or bad, morally wrong or not, and who to blame for it. Importantly, some of these quick decisions will be erroneous because they rely on preexisting biases and limited information.</p><p>The four-category framework can also help us understand that every moral situation can be considered from various angles and that holding beliefs on a single issue that are contradictory is entirely natural.</p><p>Something can be \"bad\" and \"wrong,\" like letting a person die by being hit by a trolley car, and also \"permissible,\" since the alternative in most trolley considerations is to let five other people get hit. The person who pulls the lever in the trolley problem might be \"blameworthy\" in this case, but not in the same way as a person who pushes a man on the tracks to stop the trolley.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/H66h3P5lCBQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 16:41:44 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAxNjIzMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODY4NDE5NH0.QotyaV0Sx9NJp4GwfspYFyTYnk2rTE6Adx07XLIaCoA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C289%2C0%2C290&height=700","linkMd5":"27066029a6a71fa265a0214ec28c469a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn27@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-27-200_a07c88a16a480b16.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":150338,"destBytes":150338,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAxNjIzMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODY4NDE5NH0.QotyaV0Sx9NJp4GwfspYFyTYnk2rTE6Adx07XLIaCoA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C289%2C0%2C290&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn27@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-27-200_a07c88a16a480b16.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/H66h3P5lCBQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn21@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-58-217_0b144dc36518ddd4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026319309},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","title":"Rain, caves, and miracles: New study connects weather to ancient tales","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/rain-miracles-cave-italy","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk0NzQxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MDY1NjIyNH0.ynI--qD9U9vAemQpqoEGdpQESAc0-y6BG_NS6eTvxHE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C132%2C0%2C132&height=700\"/><br/><br/><li>Ancient climate patterns can be determined by examining the ratios of various isotopes.</li><li>Isotopic signatures found in Italian cave stalagmites suggest that the Sixth Century was wetter than usual.</li><li>The study provides a partial explanation for the origin of stories about saints performing water miracles. </li><hr/><p>Ancient and near ancient records are often less than trustworthy.

Stalagmites, which are the pointy rock formations on the ground in caves, provide a record of the environmental conditions they formed in.

Uranium-thorium dating was used to provide precise dates for these points.</p><p>Oxygen isotope ratios were then measured to distinguish between wetter and drier periods.

After analysing trillions of collisions produced over the last decade, we may be seeing evidence of something altogether new – potentially the carrier of a brand new force of nature.</p><p>But the excitement is tempered by extreme caution. The standard model has withstood every experimental test thrown at it since it was assembled in the 1970s, so to claim that we're finally seeing something it can't explain requires extraordinary evidence. </p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Strange anomaly</h2><p>The standard model describes nature on the smallest of scales, comprising <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-are-fundamental-particles-38339\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental particles</a> known as leptons (such as electrons) and quarks (which can come together to form heavier particles such as protons and neutrons) and the forces they interact with.</p><p>There are many different kinds of quarks, some of which are unstable and can decay into other particles. The new result relates to an experimental anomaly that was <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.151601\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first hinted at in 2014</a>, when LHCb physicists spotted \"beauty\" quarks decaying in unexpected ways.</p><p>Specifically, beauty quarks appeared to be decaying into leptons called \"muons\" less often than they decayed into electrons. This is strange because the muon is in essence a carbon-copy of the electron, identical in every way except that it's around 200 times heavier.</p><p>You would expect beauty quarks to decay into muons just as often as they do to electrons. The only way these decays could happen at different rates is if some never-before-seen particles were getting involved in the decay and tipping the scales against muons.</p><p>While the 2014 result was intriguing, it wasn't precise enough to draw a firm conclusion. Since then, a number of other anomalies have appeared in related processes. They have all individually been too subtle for researchers to be confident that they were genuine signs of new physics, but tantalisingly, they all seemed to be pointing in a similar direction.</p><p>The big question was whether these anomalies would get stronger as more data was analysed or melt away into nothing. In 2019, LHCb performed the <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.191801\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">same measurement</a> of beauty quark decay again but with extra data taken in 2015 and 2016. But things weren't much clearer than they'd been five years earlier.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>New results</h2><p>Today's result doubles the existing dataset by adding the sample recorded in 2017 and 2018. To avoid accidentally introducing biases, the data was analysed \"blind\" – the scientists couldn't see the result until all the procedures used in the measurement had been tested and reviewed.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/mitesh.patel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mitesh Patel</a>, a particle physicist at Imperial College London and one of the leaders of the experiment, described the excitement he felt when the moment came to look at the result. \"I was actually shaking\", he said, \"I realised this was probably the most exciting thing I've done in my 20 years in particle physics.\"</p><p>When the result came up on the screen, the anomaly was still there – around 85 muon decays for every 100 electron decays, but with a smaller uncertainty than before.</p><p>What will excite many physicists is that the uncertainty of the result is now over \"three sigma\" – scientists' way of saying that there is only around a one in a thousand chance that the result is a random fluke of the data. Conventionally, particle physicists call anything over three sigma \"evidence\". However, we are still a long way from a confirmed \"discovery\" or \"observation\" – that would require five sigma.</p><p>Theorists have shown it is possible to explain this anomaly (and others) by recognising the existence of brand new particles that are influencing the ways in which the quarks decays. One possibility is a fundamental particle called a \"Z prime\" – in essence a carrier of a brand new force of nature. This force would be extremely weak, which is why we haven't seen any signs of it until now, and would interact with electrons and muons differently.</p><p>Another option is the hypothetical \"<a href=\"https://home.cern/news/news/physics/hunt-leptoquarks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">leptoquark</a>\" – a particle that has the unique ability to decay to quarks and leptons simultaneously and could be part of a larger puzzle that explains why we see the particles that we do in nature.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Interpreting the findings</h2><p>So have we finally seen evidence of new physics? Well, maybe, maybe not. We do a lot of measurements at the LHC, so you might expect at least some of them to fall this far from the standard model. And we can never totally discount the possibility that there's some bias in our experiment that we haven't properly accounted for, even though this result has been checked extraordinarily thoroughly. Ultimately, the picture will only become clearer with more data. LHCb is currently undergoing a major upgrade to dramatically increase the rate it can record collisions.</p><p>Even if the anomaly persists, it will probably only be fully accepted once an independent experiment confirms the results. One exciting possibility is that we might be able to detect the new particles responsible for the effect being created directly in the collisions at the LHC. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.belle2.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Belle II experiment</a> in Japan should be able to make similar measurements.</p><p>What then, could this mean for the future of fundamental physics? If what we are seeing is really the harbinger of some new fundamental particles then it will finally be the breakthrough that physicists have been yearning for for decades.</p><p>We will have finally seen a part of the larger picture that lies beyond the standard model, which ultimately could allow us to unravel any number of established mysteries. These include the nature of the invisible dark matter that fills the universe, or the nature of the Higgs boson. It could even help theorists unify the fundamental particles and forces. Or, perhaps best of all, it could be pointing at something we have never even considered.</p><p>So, should we be excited? Yes, results like this don't come around very often, the hunt is definitely on. But we should be cautious and humble too; extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Only time and hard work will tell if we have finally seen the first glimmer of what lies beyond our current understanding of particle physics.<img alt=\"The Conversation\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/157464/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/harry-cliff-103546\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Cliff</a>, Particle physicist, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-cambridge-1283\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Cambridge</a></em>; <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/konstantinos-alexandros-petridis-1219851\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Konstantinos Alexandros Petridis</a>, Senior lecturer in Particle Physics, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-bristol-1211\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Bristol</a></em>, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/paula-alvarez-cartelle-1219212\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paula Alvarez Cartelle</a>, Lecturer of Particle Physics, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-cambridge-1283\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Cambridge</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Both are close to the beachfront, the most desirable location in any seaside resort.</p>\n<h2>The darker history of Monopoly</h2>\n<p>These names weren't picked at random. In the early 1930s, various informal versions of Monopoly were played throughout the northeastern United States, with local street names inserted for each city. The game's appearance and rules were perfected as it was being played. Around that time, an Atlantic City realtor named Jesse Railford hit upon an innovation: to put not just names but also prices on the properties on the board. Since he knew the lay of the land in his home city, those prices reflected the hierarchy of real estate values at that time.</p>\n<p>That hierarchy and those prices were informed by the segregation that was rife in 1930s America. As one of the gateways of the Great Migration in the early 20th century, Atlantic City was a waystation for countless African-Americans leaving behind the stifling oppression of the South for better economic opportunities in the North. However, what they encountered on the way and upon arrival was the same racism, in slightly different form.</p>\n<p>Railford played the game with the Harveys, who lived on Pennsylvania Avenue. They had previously lived on Ventnor Avenue and had friends on Park Place—all of which fall into the pricier color categories on the board.</p>\n<p>In 1930s Atlantic City, these were wealthy and exclusive areas, and \"exclusive\" also meant no Black residents. They lived in low-cost areas like Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues; the latter street is actually where the Harveys' maid called home. In many local hotels at the time, African-Americans were only welcome as workers, not as guests. Atlantic City schools and beaches were segregated.</p>\n<p>Belying both the binary prejudices of the time and the sliding price scale of the Monopoly board, Atlantic City back then was in fact a place of opportunity where a diverse range of communities flourished. Black businesses thrived on Kentucky Avenue. Count Basie played the Paradise Club on Illinois Avenue. There was a Black beach at the end of Indiana Avenue. For Chinese restaurants and Jewish delis, people headed to Oriental Avenue. New York Avenue had some of the first gay bars in the U.S.</p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"a00f35e0a63ab5bbc68a5372286f8a9d\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyOTA5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMDI2NDc3NH0.UiDX62DC9l0q13YizbQpK6baWswSJ_Ro9LAAlX-mgWk/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1500\" id=\"f0208\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1500\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\" spellcheck=\"false\">Lizzie Magie (née Phillips), the anti-monopolist who invented… Monopoly.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lizzie_Magie_-_My_Betrothed,_and_Other_Poems.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public domain</a></small></p>\n<h2>It should have been called \"Anti-Monopoly\"<br /></h2>\n<p><strong></strong>An Atlantic City-based board was sold to Parker Brothers by Charles Darrow, who claimed to have invented the game in his basement. Parker Brothers marketed the game as <em>Monopoly</em> from 1935. The rights to the game transferred to Hasbro when it acquired Parker Brothers in 1991.</p>\n<p>But Darrow didn't invent Monopoly. The original idea, as became widely known only decades after its \"official\" launch, came from Lizzie Magie (1866-1948), née Elizabeth J. Phillips.</p>\n<p>Magie was a woman of many talents and trades. She worked as a stenographer, a typist, and a news reporter; she wrote poems and short stories; she was a comedian, an actress, and a feminist (she once published an ad to auction herself off as a \"young woman American slave,\" to make the point that only white men were truly free); and she patented an invention that made typewriting easier.</p>\n<p>Despite that impressive resume, she is now remembered mainly—and barely so—as the inventor of <em>Monopoly</em>. Except that the board game she developed was called <em>The Landlord's Game</em>. She patented it in 1904 and re-patented a revised version in 1924. The game was innovative because of its circular pattern—most board games at the time were linear. But its real point was economic, political, and ultimately, fiscal. <em>The Landlord's Game</em> illustrated Magie's belief in what was later called Georgism.</p>\n<p>Known as the \"single tax movement\" and popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, its concepts were formulated by the economist Henry George. He suggested that rather than taxing labor, trade, or sales, governments should derive their funding only from taxing land and the natural resources that derive from it.</p>\n<p>As already observed by earlier thinkers such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, a land tax is economically more efficient than other taxes, since it places no burden on economic activity. It would also reduce property speculation, eliminate boom and bust cycles, and even out economic inequality.</p>\n<p>Although Georgist ideas were influential for a while and continue to be discussed—among others by Ralph Nader during his 2004 presidential candidacy—they are no longer a vital political force, except in the related field of emissions trading. One popular counterargument to modern Georgism, now also (but not entirely interchangeably) known as \"geoism,\" \"geolibertarianism,\" and \"earth-sharing,\" is that government expenditure has increased by so much since George's day that it can no longer be covered by a land tax alone.</p>\n<p>Back around the turn of the 20th century, Magie devised The Landlord's Game to educate its players about the evils of real estate monopolies and, implicitly, about the benefits of a single tax on land.</p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d89edec668e4c6c9499417802a697724\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyOTEwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MDAyNzgzMX0.2jm0KH2R_qG34gP544jcynK3IH0gFvkj41PJY09Hah0/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1800\" id=\"4331b\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1800\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\" spellcheck=\"false\">The Landlord's Game, Lizzie Magie's forgotten precursor to Monopoly.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\" spellcheck=\"false\">Credit: Thomas Forsyth, owner of <a href=\"http://landlordsgame.info/games/lg-1906/lg-1906.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Landord's Game</a>® / public domain</small></p>\n<p>She created two sets of rules: an anti-monopolist one, called <em>Prosperity</em>, in which all were rewarded for any wealth created; and a monopolist one, called <em>Monopoly</em>, in which the aim was to crush one's opponents by creating monopolies. In the latter version, when a player owns all the streets of one color, they can charge double rent and erect houses and hotels on the properties.<br /></p>\n<p>Taken together, these two versions were meant to illustrate the evil of monopolies and the benefit of a more cooperative approach to wealth creation. It's very telling of human nature that it's the opponent-crushing version that came out the winner. But, in the light of what happened to Magie, perhaps not entirely surprising.</p>\n<p>When Darrow claimed Monopoly as his own, Magie protested. In the end, her patent was bought out by Parker Brothers for a mere $500, without any residual earnings. Parker Brothers continued to acknowledge Darrow as the inventor of the game.

All evolved the relatively rare ability to produce venom — chemical toxins that kill or incapacitate other animals through bites or stings. And in a few thousands years, there's a chance that scientists will add mice to that list.</p><p>That's one of the takeaways of a new study that explored the evolutionary origins of oral venom systems in animals, which have until now remained little understood.</p><p>\"Oral venom systems evolved multiple times in numerous vertebrates enabling the exploitation of unique predatory niches,\" the researchers noted. \"Yet how and when they evolved remains poorly understood. Up to now, most research on venom evolution has focused strictly on the toxins.\"</p><p>In the new study, published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2021311118#sec-12\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PNAS</em></a>, researchers instead focused on the gene-regulating networks associated with the production of venom in snakes. Because venom is a complex mixture of proteins, venom-producing animals have evolved a molecular system that's capable of properly folding chains of amino acids in a highly specific way. Without this, animals wouldn't be able to withstand the cellular stress caused by producing venom.</p><p>To better understand this process, the researchers examined venom glands of the Taiwan habu <a href=\"https://phys.org/tags/snake/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">snak</a>e, a pit viper endemic to Asia. The goal was to identify genes that are strongly coexpressed with venom. The researchers identified 3,000 \"housekeeping genes\" (i.e., genes that are always turned \"on\") that are associated with venom production, but primarily involved with protein folding and modification. They dubbed these nontoxic genes the \"metavenom network.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"97029a72b016836c21e23d3b36aebca1\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAyODI0NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MjQ2OTg4M30.SqmiJEBM-5PicS4JzJx833Of3DMohbeDGaOEWjWznV8/img.png?width=980\" height=\"1192\" id=\"25d42\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"2152\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Blue pit viper from Indonesia</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/images/blue-pit-viper-from-indonesia/185603906?hide_header=1\" target=\"_blank\">Credit: Deki via Adobe Stock</a></small></p><p>After identifying the metavenom network in snakes, the researchers searched for similar networks within the genomes of other animals: mice, dogs, and humans. The results showed that these animals also possess key structures of the metavenom network that's found in snakes, suggesting mammals and snakes share a \"common [gene] regulatory core\" that traces back hundreds of millions of years to the species' common ancestor.<br/></p><p>The key phenotypic difference is that snakes use this shared regulatory core to produce venom, while most other animals use it to produce saliva.</p><p>\"[T]his is the first real solid evidence for the theory that venom glands evolved from early salivary glands,\" lead study author Agneesh Barua, a Ph.D. student at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), said in a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/oios-amb032421.php#:~:text=Startling%20new%20evidence%20shows%20mammal,share%20a%20common%20genetic%20foundation.&text=Reporting%20this%20week%20in%20PNAS,in%20both%20reptiles%20and%20mammals.\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. \"And while snakes then went crazy, incorporating many different toxins into their venom and increasing the number of genes involved in producing venom, mammals like shrews produce simpler venom that has a high similarity to saliva.\"</p><p>So, given that mammals and snakes share more evolutionary mechanisms than previously thought, could animals like mice someday evolve the ability to produce venom? Barua said it's possible.</p><p>\"There were experiments in the 1980s that showed that male mice produce compounds in their saliva that are highly toxic when injected into rats,\" Barua said in the press release. \"If under certain ecological conditions, mice that produce more toxic proteins in their saliva have better reproductive success, then in a few thousand years, we might encounter venomous mice.\"</p><p>Overall, the study blurs \"the line between venomous animals and their ancestors,\" and highlights the fundamental similarities between animals that look and behave very differently upon first glance.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/90uSqY9Fr_o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 01:24:05 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAxMzIxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTI5NDQ5Mn0.gt7h93sVrk590kVtNIRvw-90oIX0t_tEZZF0D6aqws8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C278%2C0%2C279&height=700","linkMd5":"9d7f9dc1c6a24466b3e670f3c5fb00e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-35-478_b6625e60c4074137.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":35618,"destBytes":35618,"author":"Stephen Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAxMzIxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTI5NDQ5Mn0.gt7h93sVrk590kVtNIRvw-90oIX0t_tEZZF0D6aqws8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C278%2C0%2C279&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-35-478_b6625e60c4074137.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/90uSqY9Fr_o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn24@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-58-185_a2f1558e15c94d38.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026319307},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:19","title":"Go ahead and consult ‘Dr. Google’ about your medical symptoms","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/googling-medical-symptoms","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTkyNTA0Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyOTUwNDYzNn0.DmB6k9lZnuvcStCbQkqBzt8t5VCrStUZWRknWdrnA8w/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C340%2C0%2C-2&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li><a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/images/shot-of-a-doctor-showing-a-patient-some-information-on-a-digital-tablet/238730671?hide_header=1\" target=\"_blank\">Credit: bongkarn via Adobe Stock</a>Conventional wisdom in healthcare holds that searching Google for medical information often leads to anxiety and false diagnoses.</li><li>However, a recent study found that searching Google helped participants more accurately diagnose medical conditions in hypothetical cases.</li><li>The results didn't show massive differences in accuracy, but they suggest searching Google for medical information probably won't harm patients.</li></ul><hr/><p>When you're feeling sick, or experiencing symptoms of a potential medical condition, do you consult Google?</p><p>Odds are you do: <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2013/02/12/the-internet-and-health/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Surveys suggest</a> that more than half of Americans use the internet to search for medical information in any given year, while about one-third have used Google for self-diagnosis.</p><p>But some medical professionals wish those numbers were lower.

It gives me hope that things will be better on the next level. Unfortunately, the idea is unscientific. But why do some people believe in the simulation hypothesis? And just exactly what's the problem with it? That's what we'll talk about today.<br/><br/>According to the simulation hypothesis, everything we experience was coded by an intelligent being, and we are part of that computer code. That we live in some kind of computation in and by itself is not unscientific. For all we currently know, the laws of nature are mathematical, so you could say the universe is really just computing those laws. You may find this terminology a little weird, and I would agree, but it's not controversial. The controversial bit about the simulation hypothesis is that it assumes there is another level of reality where someone or some thing controls what we believe are the laws of nature, or even interferes with those laws.<br/><br/>The belief in an omniscient being that can interfere with the laws of nature, but for some reason remains hidden from us, is a common element of monotheistic religions. But those who believe in the simulation hypothesis argue they arrived at their belief by reason. The philosopher Nick Boström, for example, claims it's likely that we live in a computer simulation based on an argument that, in a nutshell, goes like this. If there are a) many civilizations, and these civilizations b) build computers that run simulations of conscious beings, then c) there are many more simulated conscious beings than real ones, so you are likely to live in a simulation.<br/><br/>Elon Musk is among those who have bought into it. He too has said \"it's most likely we're in a simulation.\" And even Neil DeGrasse Tyson gave the simulation hypothesis \"better than 50-50 odds\" of being correct.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"b593a3858896012a05180b80b4d24bcd\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDcNVZjaNSU?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Are we living in a simulation? | Bill Nye, Joscha Bach, Donald Hoffman | Big Think</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDcNVZjaNSU\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n        </small>\n        </p><p><br/></p><p>Maybe you're now rolling your eyes because, come on, let the nerds have some fun, right? And, sure, some part of this conversation is just intellectual entertainment. But I don't think popularizing the simulation hypothesis is entirely innocent fun. It's mixing science with religion, which is generally a bad idea, and, really, I think we have better things to worry about than that someone might pull the plug on us. I dare you!</p><p>But before I explain why the simulation hypothesis is not a scientific argument, I have a general comment about the difference between religion and science. Take an example from Christian faith, like Jesus healing the blind and lame. It's a religious story, but not because it's impossible to heal blind and lame people. One day we might well be able to do that. It's a religious story because it doesn't explain how the healing supposedly happens. The whole point is that the believers take it on faith. In science, in contrast, we require explanations for how something works.<br/><br/>Let us then have a look at Boström's argument. Here it is again. If there are many civilizations that run many simulations of conscious beings, then you are likely to be simulated.<br/><br/>First of all, it could be that one or both of the premises is wrong. Maybe there aren't any other civilizations, or they aren't interested in simulations. That wouldn't make the argument wrong of course; it would just mean that the conclusion can't be drawn. But I will leave aside the possibility that one of the premises is wrong because really I don't think we have good evidence for one side or the other.<br/><br/>The point I have seen people criticize most frequently about Boström's argument is that he just assumes it is possible to simulate human-like consciousness. We don't actually know that this is possible. However, in this case it would require explanation to assume that it is not possible. That's because, for all we currently know, consciousness is simply a property of certain systems that process large amounts of information. It doesn't really matter exactly what physical basis this information processing is based on. Could be neurons or could be transistors, or it could be transistors believing they are neurons. So, I don't think simulating consciousness is the problematic part.<br/><br/>The problematic part of Boström's argument is that he assumes it is possible to reproduce all our observations using not the natural laws that physicists have confirmed to extremely high precision, but using a different, underlying algorithm, which the programmer is running. I don't think that's what Boström meant to do, but it's what he did. He implicitly claimed that it's easy to reproduce the foundations of physics with something else.<br/><br/>But nobody presently knows how to reproduce General Relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics from a computer algorithm running on some sort of machine. You can approximate the laws that we know with a computer simulation – we do this all the time – but if that was how nature actually worked, we could see the difference. Indeed, physicists have looked for signs that natural laws really proceed step by step, like in a computer code, but their search has come up empty handed. It's possible to tell the difference because attempts to algorithmically reproduce natural laws are usually incompatible with the symmetries of Einstein's theories of Special and General Relativity. I'll leave you a reference in the info below the video. The bottom line is it's not easy to outdo Einstein.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help, by the way, if you assume that the simulation would run on a quantum computer. Quantum computers, as I have explained earlier, are special purpose machines. Nobody currently knows how to put General Relativity on a quantum computer.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ibm_research_zurich/50252942522\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"IBM quantum computer \" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"94501595521be74eb05fe1869786b762\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk1ODk0OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1ODU5OTcxNn0.U3xbR0iTv-cCJcI07qiVMnUhN1dajCkL41NkVCkbP90/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1066\" id=\"2f1d5\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1599\"/></a>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">IBM's quantum computer</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ibm_research_zurich/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Go to IBM Research's photostream\">IBM Research</a> via Flickr and licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-ND 2.0</a></small></p><div style=\"display: none;\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ibm_research_zurich/50252942522\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"IBM quantum computer \" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"ef6726f4f3bf15978acd1f9cdbc32f09\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk1ODk0OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1ODU5OTcxNn0.U3xbR0iTv-cCJcI07qiVMnUhN1dajCkL41NkVCkbP90/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1066\" id=\"2f1d5\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1599\"/></a></div><p><br/></p><p>A second issue with Boström's argument is that, for it to work, a civilization needs to be able to simulate a lot of conscious beings, and these conscious beings will themselves try to simulate conscious beings, and so on. This means you have to compress the information that we think the universe contains. Boström therefore has to assume that it's somehow possible to not care much about the details in some parts of the world where no one is currently looking, and just fill them in case someone looks.<br/><br/>Again though, he doesn't explain how this is supposed to work. What kind of computer code can actually do that? What algorithm can identify conscious subsystems and their intention and then quickly fill in the required information without ever producing an observable inconsistency? That's a much more difficult issue than Boström seems to appreciate. You cannot in general just throw away physical processes on short distances and still get the long distances right.<br/><br/>Climate models are an excellent example. We don't currently have the computational capacity to resolve distances below something like 10 kilometers or so. But you can't just throw away all the physics below this scale. This is a non-linear system, so the information from the short scales propagates up into large scales. If you can't compute the short-distance physics, you have to suitably replace it with something. Getting this right even approximately is a big headache. And the only reason climate scientists do get it approximately right is that they have observations which they can use to check whether their approximations work. If you only have a simulation, like the programmer in the simulation hypothesis, you can't do that.<br/><br/>And that's my issue with the simulation hypothesis. Those who believe it make, maybe unknowingly, really big assumptions about what natural laws can be reproduced with computer simulations, and they don't explain how this is supposed to work. But finding alternative explanations that match all our observations to high precision is really difficult. The simulation hypothesis, therefore, just isn't a serious scientific argument. This doesn't mean it's wrong, but it means you'd have to believe it because you have faith, not because you have logic on your side.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"1aa95dd66711446e578ef5c36cf593c8\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HCSqogSPU_Q?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">The Simulation Hypothesis is Pseudoscience</small>\n        \n        </p><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><p><em>Republished with permission of Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder.
